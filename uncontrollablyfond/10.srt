2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,380
<font color="yellow">Talk to her one more time, Dad.</font>

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,010
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,290
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,570
<font color="yellow">She said she won't come no matter how big the award is.</font>

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,010
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her how important this event is?</font>

7
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,780
<font color="yellow">Of course I did.</font>

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,170
<font color="yellow">I said ministers and congressmen would be here...</font>

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,330
<font color="yellow">and that nothing must go wrong.</font>

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,450
<font color="yellow">I even told her that...</font>

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,130
<font color="yellow">you might hang yourself if she didn't attend.</font>

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,490
<font color="yellow">I repeated myself more than enough.</font>

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,900
<font color="yellow">Do you want to switch your mum?</font>

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,650
<font color="yellow">There are mothers...</font>

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,930
<font color="yellow">who'd be more than happy to have you as a son.</font>

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,810
<font color="yellow">Go and get me a sedative.</font>

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,050
<font color="yellow">And tell my wife to bring my blood pressure medicine.</font>

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,650
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say Producer Noh wasn't going to be here?</font>

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, Joon Young told me to tell her not to come.</font>

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,450
<font color="yellow">But I saw her outside with a camera.</font>

21
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,410
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,690
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember me?</font>

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,850
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,530
<font color="yellow">She's a gold-digger.</font>

25
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,810
<font color="yellow">She tried to get Joon Young, but her face got revealed,</font>

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,690
<font color="yellow">so she failed before she could do anything.</font>

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,690
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru.</font>

28
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,500
<font color="yellow">Did my daughter do this?</font>

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,750
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

30
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,010
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me. It was the kitten.</font>

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,530
<font color="yellow">But it doesn't know any better. It's just a kitten.</font>

32
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,690
<font color="yellow">Today's my father's memorial day.</font>

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,450
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

35
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.</font>

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,370
<font color="yellow">So don't be mad and take this.</font>

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving her 50 dollars?</font>

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,970
<font color="yellow">- This all costs less than three dollars.
- Ha Ru.</font>

39
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,210
<font color="yellow">Here. Go on and take it.</font>

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,170
<font color="yellow">You should apologise first.</font>

41
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,530
<font color="yellow">Instead of giving her money,</font>

42
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,650
<font color="yellow">you should apologise first.</font>

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,810
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

44
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,050
<font color="yellow">you should apologise to me first.</font>

45
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,930
<font color="yellow">I don't know how you know this lady,</font>

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,770
<font color="yellow">but you rudely interrupted us.</font>

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any manners?</font>

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,530
<font color="yellow">Is this how your parents taught you?</font>

49
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,890
<font color="yellow">I only asked you to admit your mistake...</font>

50
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,170
<font color="yellow">and ask for forgiveness.</font>

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,170
<font color="yellow">You want me to apologise because of something...</font>

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,790
<font color="yellow">a stray cat did?</font>

53
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,050
<font color="yellow">I asked you to...</font>

54
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,530
<font color="yellow">admit your mistake and ask for...</font>

55
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,290
<font color="yellow">I was mistaken about you.</font>

56
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,170
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you were so reckless...</font>

57
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,460
<font color="yellow">and wasted my time waiting for you.</font>

58
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,850
<font color="yellow">I had a strange feeling that one day...</font>

59
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,190
<font color="yellow">you would come for the book.</font>

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,210
<font color="yellow">Because of that, I could never throw it away.</font>

61
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,130
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had changed so much.</font>

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,090
<font color="yellow">Society's moral standards and hierarchy is falling,</font>

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,930
<font color="yellow">but I'm still...</font>

64
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,610
<font color="yellow">old enough to be your father.</font>

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="yellow">I don't know how important a star is in Korea,</font>

66
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,170
<font color="yellow">but learn some manners before fame goes to your head.</font>

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,610
<font color="yellow">Then you can demand an apology.</font>

68
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,970
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Ha Ru.</font>

69
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,970
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come here. You never listen.</font>

70
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,130
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,060
<font color="yellow">Don't pick that up!</font>

72
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,010
<font color="yellow">- Then should I throw it away?
- Yes!</font>

73
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,810
<font color="yellow">I should've asked for more.</font>

74
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,850
<font color="yellow">About 1,000 dollars more.</font>

75
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,080
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,690
<font color="yellow">You can't tear up money!</font>

77
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,140
<font color="yellow">Leave it.</font>

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,530
<font color="yellow">I said leave it. Are you a beggar?</font>

79
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am. Didn't you know?</font>

80
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,170
<font color="yellow">Just mind your own business.</font>

81
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,610
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

82
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,440
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you out here? We were looking for you.</font>

84
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,290
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

85
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,970
<font color="yellow">President Nam says he'll accept the award...</font>

86
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,130
<font color="yellow">instead of your mum.</font>

87
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,170
<font color="yellow">Everyone kept saying that...</font>

88
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,170
<font color="yellow">Joon Young's mother gave birth to him,</font>

89
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,180
<font color="yellow">but I'm the one who made him a star.</font>

90
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,110
<font color="yellow">I never said anything like that.</font>

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,130
<font color="yellow">Me neither.</font>

92
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,010
<font color="yellow">I know. I wasn't talking about you two.</font>

93
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,890
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

94
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,010
<font color="yellow">Right, it was the makeup team.</font>

95
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,910
<font color="yellow">Ms Jung, I'm ready for some makeup.</font>

96
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,010
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone.</font>

97
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,530
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

98
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,970
<font color="yellow">I said I won't go.</font>

99
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,730
<font color="yellow">Are you bored, Gook Young?</font>

100
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,290
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Move it.</font>

101
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,410
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up. Don't call me again.</font>

102
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,410
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong?</font>

103
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,930
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,570
<font color="yellow">Is it that wrong that I became a celebrity...</font>

105
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,530
<font color="yellow">and not a prosecutor like you wanted?</font>

106
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,410
<font color="yellow">You hated me for five years...</font>

107
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,410
<font color="yellow">and disowned me as a son.</font>

108
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,970
<font color="yellow">Was what I did that serious?</font>

109
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,210
<font color="yellow">I believe a prosecutor...</font>

110
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,970
<font color="yellow">should tell only the truth in any situation,</font>

111
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,490
<font color="yellow">punish the wrongdoers...</font>

112
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,090
<font color="yellow">and clear the names of the innocent.</font>

113
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,360
<font color="yellow">But I'm not like that.</font>

114
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,130
<font color="yellow">I told you dozens of times that I don't qualify!</font>

115
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,770
<font color="yellow">I'm not cut out for the job.</font>

116
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
<font color="yellow">If a person like me becomes a prosecutor,</font>

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,440
<font color="yellow">then powerless and poor people like you...</font>

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,050
<font color="yellow">can't survive in Korea.</font>

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,610
<font color="yellow">Why don't you qualify?</font>

120
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,640
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you cut out for the job?</font>

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,620
<font color="yellow">You tried to save a girl from the school bullies...</font>

122
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,000
<font color="yellow">and got suspended once.</font>

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,050
<font color="yellow">Is it because...</font>

124
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
<font color="yellow">I used to...</font>

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
<font color="yellow">work at bars...</font>

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,810
<font color="yellow">a long time ago?</font>

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
<font color="yellow">Is it because I stole 300g of meat when you were young?</font>

128
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,960
<font color="yellow">Say I worked at the bar just so I could make a living.</font>

129
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,760
<font color="yellow">And say that I returned the meat later on.</font>

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't come.</font>

131
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
<font color="yellow">I'll refuse the award.</font>

132
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

133
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you changing? We have to leave soon.</font>

134
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
<font color="yellow">- Joon Young.
- Joon Young.</font>

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
<font color="yellow">Joon Young. Joon Young.</font>

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

137
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,450
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

138
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,060
<font color="yellow">You've lost your mind.</font>

139
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,790
<font color="yellow">The ceremony starts in 10 minutes.</font>

140
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,930
<font color="yellow">I said I won't go.</font>

141
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,660
<font color="yellow">This isn't like not showing up for some TV programme.</font>

142
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,260
<font color="yellow">You know what kind of people are here today.</font>

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,220
<font color="yellow">There are ministers and congressmen...</font>

144
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,240
<font color="yellow">I said move.</font>

145
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
<font color="yellow">Right now!</font>

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,870
<font color="yellow">Gook Young, get help.</font>

147
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,300
<font color="yellow">Our president just fainted.</font>

148
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

149
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
<font color="yellow">Take him to a hospital.</font>

150
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

151
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

152
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

153
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,600
<font color="yellow">I felt fine a while ago. I don't understand.</font>

154
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,810
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have brought you here.</font>

155
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,960
<font color="yellow">You're still too weak.</font>

156
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,800
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,080

<font color="yellow">- Take this off.
- I won't.</font>

512
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,790

513
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,490
<font color="yellow">broil the meat and cook the stew.</font>

00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,910
<font color="yellow">Young Deuk, go and get my sewing kit.</font>

517
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:31,990
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

518
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,790
<font color="yellow">To sew this onto his skin.</font>

519
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,430
<font color="yellow">Fine, go ahead.</font>

520
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,400
<font color="yellow">It's the most expensive outfit I ever wore.</font>

521
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,790
<font color="yellow">I'd love to keep it on.</font>

522
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,520
<font color="yellow">- Ms Shin.
- Fine.</font>

523
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,890
<font color="yellow">Splash water on me.</font>

524
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,510
<font color="yellow">I won't take it off even if you throw poop at me.</font>

525
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,370
<font color="yellow">It's Joon Young.</font>

526
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,090
<font color="yellow">- Don't take it. Don't pick up.
- Let go.</font>

527
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,130
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, I really meant to go.</font>

528
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,030
<font color="yellow">I wore the tuxedo you sent...</font>

529
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,270
<font color="yellow">and even prepared for an interview,</font>

530
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,350
<font color="yellow">but your mum suddenly went...</font>

531
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,950
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

532
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,550
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

533
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,510
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

534
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,950
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? You sound so weak.</font>

535
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,750
<font color="yellow">Did someone beat you up?</font>

536
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,150
<font color="yellow">Shall I put your mum on the phone?</font>

537
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,790
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

538
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,470
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

539
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,830
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

540
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,320
<font color="yellow">I knew that Nam Goong guy was a freak.</font>

541
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,010
<font color="yellow">That evil president.</font>

542
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,230
<font color="yellow">How dare he lock Joon Young up.</font>

543
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,110
<font color="yellow">He only cares about money.</font>

544
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,190
<font color="yellow">I knew he was weird the day he let out a fake scandal.</font>

545
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,910
<font color="yellow">I should beat him for three days,</font>

546
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,750
<font color="yellow">then wake up and continue beating him.</font>

547
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,870
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and drive.</font>

548
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

549
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,310
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

550
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,270
<font color="yellow">How loving and caring you are.</font>

<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

552
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,150
<font color="yellow">Are you a rescuer? Are you Batman or Superman?</font>

553
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,590
<font color="yellow">Why give away your coat when you're shivering?</font>

554
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,910
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

555
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare cry.</font>

556
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,590
<font color="yellow">You can't survive the cruel world if you're so weak.</font>

557
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,790
<font color="yellow">If you're like this,</font>

558
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,870
<font color="yellow">how will I ever rest in peace?</font>

559
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,310
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

560
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,990
<font color="yellow">I took the money.</font>

561
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,990
<font color="yellow">I took the money Choi Hyun Joon offered.</font>

562
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,150
<font color="yellow">I took it...</font>

563
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,030
<font color="yellow">and tried to forget about you.</font>

564
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,310
<font color="yellow">I settled, Dad.</font>

565
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,830
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd die if I didn't.</font>

566
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,150
<font color="yellow">I took the money.</font>

567
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,790
<font color="yellow">Who would care for Jik if I died too?</font>

568
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,030
<font color="yellow">I wanted to die,</font>

569
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,070
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't stand the idea of leaving him alone.</font>

570
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,510
<font color="yellow">So I took the money.</font>

571
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,510
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

572
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,070
