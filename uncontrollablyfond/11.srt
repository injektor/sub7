- Ow, ow, ow!</font>

00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,199
<font color="yellow">Let's go and tell your mom to vomit
up the seaweed soup she had</font>

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,500
<font color="yellow">after she gave birth to a sorry
excuse for a son like you!</font>

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,199
<font color="yellow">That makes no sense!</font>

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,800
<font color="yellow">Come on. How is she going to vomit up
something she ate over 30 years ago?</font>

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,399
<font color="yellow">You bastard!</font>

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,600
<font color="yellow">It's not like Joon Young committed
murder, or sold out our country!</font>

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,300
<font color="yellow">Why did you lock up a kid who's sick,
causing all this trouble?</font>

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,000
<font color="yellow">If it hadn't been for Joon Young,
you'd be living under a bridge!</font>

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,299
<font color="yellow">You ungrateful bastard!</font>

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,200
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this for him!</font>

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
<font color="yellow">What the hell did you just say?</font>

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,799
<font color="yellow">Do you even know where Joon Young
is trying to go, right now?</font>

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,500
<font color="yellow">He wants to go to the detention center
where PD No Eul is being held!</font>

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,399
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Exactly!</font>

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,700

00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,200
<font color="yellow">Those bastards.</font>

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,900
<font color="yellow">How dare they keep you locked up
when you're this sick?</font>

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, get up.
Let's get you to the hospital.</font>

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,299
<font color="yellow">Hurry!
Come on!</font>

25
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,299
<font color="yellow">All right, let's go.</font>

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,599

00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,299
<font color="yellow">Please, help me, Mom.</font>

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,199
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

32
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,699
<font color="yellow">What... did you just say?</font>

33
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,400
<font color="yellow">Did you just say Choi Hyun Joon?</font>

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,400
<font color="yellow">This woman tried to kill an assemblyman!</font>

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,900
<font color="yellow">If she acts like she's close with Joon
Young and he suffers backlash for it</font>

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,199
<font color="yellow">what will we do then?</font>

38
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,400
<font color="yellow">That's why I locked him up in his room!
Happy now?</font>

39
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,599
<font color="yellow">Um...</font>

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,099
<font color="yellow">I don't quite understand
what you're saying.</font>

41
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,500
<font color="yellow">The... assemblyman's name...</font>

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,699
<font color="yellow">is Choi...</font>

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,900
<font color="yellow">Choi Hyun Joon?
Are you sure about that?</font>

44
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,199
<font color="yellow">Help me.</font>

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,699
<font color="yellow">N-no. No.
No!</font>

46
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,699
<font color="yellow">What are you saying, when
you're in this terrible state?</font>

47
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,199
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

48
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,400
<font color="yellow">Sit still, and don't go anywhere.
I'll go and buy some medicine for you.</font>

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,300
<font color="yellow">About Mr. Choi Hyun Joon...</font>

50
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,500
<font color="yellow">If you'd just stayed by his side...</font>

51
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,599
<font color="yellow">he never would've degenerated
into who he is now.</font>

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,300
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't run away,
had stayed by his side...</font>

53
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,699
<font color="yellow">he never would've become
such a vile human being!</font>

54
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,699
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault, Mom.</font>

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,400
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault, Mom!</font>

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
<font color="yellow">You're the one who made
things end up this way!</font>

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
<font color="yellow">You're the one who made
things end up this way!</font>

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,900
<font color="yellow">Everything is your fault, Mom!</font>

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,199
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault, Mom!</font>

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,599
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!
What the hell did you say? Huh?</font>

61
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:23,899
<font color="yellow">How dare you!
Are you out of your damn mind?</font>

62
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,800
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you know what your mother
went through to raise you? Huh?</font>

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
<font color="yellow">Do you know what lengths she went to</font>

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,899
<font color="yellow">to make sure that nobody
would call you a bastard child?</font>

65
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,699
<font color="yellow">And thanks to her sacrifices,
you've grown up well!</font>

66
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,699
<font color="yellow">So is that really something
you should be saying to her?</font>

67
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,399
<font color="yellow">- Jung Shik.
- You rotten punk.</font>

68
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,699
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what your
mother is going through, right now?</font>

69
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,300
<font color="yellow">You call yourself her son?</font>

70
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,000
<font color="yellow">Do you really think I'll stand
for your diva nonsense?</font>

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,399
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're above everything,
now that you're a hotshot?</font>

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
<font color="yellow">Bastard.</font>

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
<font color="yellow">If you were my child, I would've
already beaten you to a pulp--</font>

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,500
<font color="yellow">I told you to get out, Jang Jung Shik.</font>

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,300
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

77
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,300
<font color="yellow">If you make your mother
shed any tears, you punk</font>

78
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,399
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure that you'll be
crying tears of blood! Got that?</font>

79
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,899
<font color="yellow">Just remember that.</font>

80
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,500
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,899
<font color="yellow">I'll go buy you some medicine.</font>

82
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,800
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go there
even if I have to crawl.</font>

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,399
<font color="yellow">If you won't help me, I'll go to Eul
somehow, even if I have to crawl to her.</font>

84
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,300
<font color="yellow">Young Ok.</font>

85
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,300
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

86
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Young!</font>

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,699
<font color="yellow">What took you so long?</font>

88
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how long
I waited for you?</font>

89
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,399
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

90
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,100
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

91
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,800
<font color="yellow">I... I wasn't trying to kill him!</font>

92
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,800
<font color="yellow">I promise! I wasn't trying
to kill Choi Hyun Joon!</font>

93
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,700
<font color="yellow">I was really going to forget everything
and live my life as if I were dead!</font>

94
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,000
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

95
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared, Joon Young.</font>

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you scared,
when I'm right here?</font>

97
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,200
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Where?</font>

98
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,600
<font color="yellow">We were supposed to go on
a trip together, remember?</font>

99
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,399
<font color="yellow">Let's go, and come back in ten years.</font>

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,899
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

101
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,100
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

102
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,899
<font color="yellow">Yeah.
Right now.</font>

103
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,399
<font color="yellow">Let's spend a century here
before we go back to reality.</font>

104
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,399
<font color="yellow">Let's hide in a place
where nobody will find us...</font>

105
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
<font color="yellow">and spend just a century there,
before we head back.</font>

106
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,100
<font color="yellow">Your food is already cold.</font>

107
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
<font color="yellow">I'll go and heat it up again.</font>

108
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,299
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

109
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,200
<font color="yellow">He hasn't eaten anything
yesterday or today?</font>

110
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,799
<font color="yellow"><i>That's not the problem. He doesn't
even look like he's breathing!</i></font>

111
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,399
<font color="yellow"><i>What are we going to do if
Joon Young dies at this rate?</i></font>

112
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,299
<font color="yellow">Wow. A guy dying because of some girl?</font>

113
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,200
<font color="yellow">Looks like I'll have to
bring a shovel over later.</font>

114
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,299
<font color="yellow">Tell him to wait. I'll come and shove
food into that stubborn mouth of his.</font>

115
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,500
<font color="yellow">Geez!</font>

116
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,200
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

117
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,700
<font color="yellow">Geez!</font>

118
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,500
<font color="yellow">Jik!</font>

119
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,700
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?
You said you have an exam today!</font>

120
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
<font color="yellow">I just left in the middle of it.</font>

121
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,700
<font color="yellow">Figures. I'm sure that you couldn't
focus on a test right now.</font>

122
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,600
<font color="yellow">Damn it, if only Hyun Woo were around!</font>

123
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that he'd know some attorneys</font>

124
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,899
<font color="yellow">since he stayed at that
student hostel for a while!</font>

125
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,000
<font color="yellow">Damn it, where did he disappear to?</font>

126
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,799
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

127
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,799
<font color="yellow">Tell both Hyun Woo and
Shin Joon Young to piss off!</font>

128
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,399
<font color="yellow">We can just take care of our
own business ourselves.</font>

129
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

130
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,799
<font color="yellow">What if my Big Sis cries?</font>

131
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,200
<font color="yellow">I've never seen my sister cry, ever.</font>

132
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,500
<font color="yellow">If I were to see her cry now...</font>

133
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,600
<font color="yellow">I think it'd drive me insane.</font>

134
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,200
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

135
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,700
<font color="yellow">We're making an exception this time,
so consider yourselves lucky.</font>

136
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,299
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

137
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,399
<font color="yellow">A middle-aged lady came in
really early this morning.</font>

138
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,200
<font color="yellow">Apparently, she ran off with a
wad of someone else's cash.</font>

139
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
<font color="yellow">But you know... you know
Mario Lee, the director, right?</font>

140
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,200
<font color="yellow">She looks just like him!
Like, she totally looks like him!</font>

141
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,100
<font color="yellow">I was totally shocked!</font>

142
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,399
<font color="yellow">You think that you should
be laughing at a time like this?</font>

143
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing
right now, in my state.</font>

144
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:26,600
<font color="yellow">So I said, "Oh, it's Mario Lee!
What brings you here?"</font>

145
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that hilarious?
- Big Sis.</font>

146
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,700
<font color="yellow">Oh. Do you not know
Mario Lee, Mr. Grandpa?</font>

147
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:38,100
<font color="yellow">You know, the guy who dances
like this. You don't know him?</font>

148
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,799
<font color="yellow">Big Sis!</font>

149
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,000
<font color="yellow">You know him, right, Na Ri?</font>

150
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,399
<font color="yellow">You know, the guy who dances like this!</font>

151
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,399
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like that?
You're being so embarrassing!</font>

152
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,200
<font color="yellow">That's not how it goes, at all!</font>

153
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,399
<font color="yellow">Mario Lee dances like this, duh!</font>

154
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,600
<font color="yellow">Like this, all right?</font>

155
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,700
<font color="yellow">You're right!
That's how it goes!</font>

156
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
<font color="yellow">Like this, right?</font>

157
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
<font color="yellow">Hey, loosen up, punk!</font>

158
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,799
<font color="yellow">I'm not on my deathbed, here.</font>

159
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,200
<font color="yellow">I'll be out of here soon, so just find
a place that makes great tofu stew--</font>

160
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,399
<font color="yellow">Big Sis. You didn't really try to kill
that assemblyman, right?</font>

161
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,799
<font color="yellow">Of course...</font>

162
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,299
<font color="yellow">not.</font>

163
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,200
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

164
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,299
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

165
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,000
<font color="yellow">I heard that Joon Young was there, too.</font>

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,299
<font color="yellow">So how come he hasn't
even been here once?</font>

167
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,899
<font color="yellow">He should testify as a witness,
saying you had no murderous intent--</font>

168
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,399
<font color="yellow">I told you not to bring
that damn bastard up.</font>

169
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,399
<font color="yellow">Jik went to go and see him,
to ask him to help you.</font>

170
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,600
<font color="yellow">But apparently, he didn't even
open his door for him.</font>

171
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,100
<font color="yellow">Don't trust that bastard, Big Sis.</font>

172
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,899
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of everything.</font>

173
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,200
<font color="yellow">I'll clear your name, and...</font>

174
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,500
<font color="yellow">Student, you should go
to school and study.</font>

175
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,700
<font color="yellow">Big Sis.</font>

176
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,500
<font color="yellow">Also, I just heard from Joon Young.</font>

177
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,599
<font color="yellow">He said that he'd come and get me soon.</font>

178
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,000
<font color="yellow">He might already be on his way by now!</font>

179
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,200
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young...</font>

180
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,400
<font color="yellow">Is going to his parking lot, right now.</font>

181
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
<font color="yellow">He's getting into his car.</font>

182
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,200
<font color="yellow">He's starting the car.</font>

183
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,799
<font color="yellow">The car is moving.</font>

184
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,700
<font color="yellow">He has 59 kilometers remaining
until he gets here.</font>

185
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,900
<font color="yellow">58 kilometers.</font>

186
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,299
<font color="yellow">This is your mother's spicy beef stew
that you wanted to eat so badly.</font>

187
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,799
<font color="yellow">Eat just one spoonful, at least!</font>

188
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,799
<font color="yellow">If you're planning to protest
by starving yourself, forget about it.</font>

189
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not to let you out, even if that
means starving you to death!</font>

190
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,799
<font color="yellow">That's what your mother told me to do.</font>

191
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:05,299
<font color="yellow">How is that not a day goes by
without some mishap?</font>

192
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,700
<font color="yellow">I was just waiting for it to happen.
Here, put this on your finger.</font>

193
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, why did you cut your finger if you
can't even put a band-aid on properly?</font>

194
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- Ow.</font>

195
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,500
<font color="yellow">You need to be focused when
you have a knife in your hand!</font>

196
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,400
<font color="yellow"><i>About Mr. Choi Hyun Joon...</i></font>

197
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,700
<font color="yellow">If you'd just stayed by his side</font>

198
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,299
<font color="yellow">he never would've degenerated
into who he is now.</font>

199
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,200
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't run away,
had just stayed by his side...</font>

200
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:51,200
<font color="yellow">he never would've become
such a vile human being!</font>

201
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,000
<font color="yellow">Young Ok.</font>

202
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,200
<font color="yellow">Young Ok!</font>

203
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,299
<font color="yellow">Where are you going, Young Ok?</font>

204
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,599
<font color="yellow">What brings you here, without any notice?</font>

205
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,599
<font color="yellow">Please release PD No Eul.</font>

206
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,299
<font color="yellow">Do you have feelings for that woman?</font>

207
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,099
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

208
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,299
<font color="yellow">From the moment that you started
hiding the truth to Mother</font>

209
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,700
<font color="yellow">and ruined that girl's life.</font>

210
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,299
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

211
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,200
<font color="yellow">You've always been a compassionate
child, since you were young.</font>

212
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,299
<font color="yellow">Even if you were walking by
and saw someone crying</font>

213
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,599
<font color="yellow">you'd ask them, "why are you crying?
How can I help you?"</font>

214
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,900
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

215
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,200
<font color="yellow">But you have far too much to lose in this
case if you were to wage everything</font>

216
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,299
<font color="yellow">for the sake of that compassionate
streak of yours, don't you think?</font>

217
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not scared.</font>

218
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,299
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

219
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,799
<font color="yellow">Then, go outside right now
and shout this to the world.</font>

220
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,799
<font color="yellow">"Choi Hyun Joon received a request he
couldn't refuse when he was a prosecutor"</font>

221
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,000
<font color="yellow">"and covered up a terrible
hit-and-run accident."</font>

222
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,200
<font color="yellow">"Furthermore, Lee Eun Soo agreed with
doing this, and ruined a girl's life."</font>

223
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,400
<font color="yellow">"And in exchange for that, two people
got everything they could ever want"</font>

224
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,500
<font color="yellow">"and are shamelessly showing that off."</font>

225
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,400
<font color="yellow">"Those two people are my parents!"</font>

226
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,799
<font color="yellow">Go and tell that to everyone!</font>

227
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,599
<font color="yellow">What, you can't do it?</font>

228
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,799
<font color="yellow">If you can't muster the
courage to do that</font>

229
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,900
<font color="yellow">keep your mouth shut,
and become a coward.</font>

230
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,200
<font color="yellow">Just like me, a long time ago.</font>

231
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,000
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, I'm so upset!</font>

232
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,799
<font color="yellow">I was actually just
about to contact you.</font>

233
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,200
<font color="yellow">It seriously looks like
he'll die, at this rate!</font>

234
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,900
<font color="yellow">He won't sleep at all,
or drink any water!</font>

235
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,299
<font color="yellow">He won't even eat your spicy beef stew!</font>

236
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,200
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset!</font>

237
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,799
<font color="yellow">What about that person?
What did he do, huh?</font>

238
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know what a great man he is?</font>

239
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,099
<font color="yellow">You couldn't possibly compare
people like us to him!</font>

240
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:09,799
<font color="yellow">So how dare you... who told
you that kind of nonsense, huh?</font>

241
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,400
<font color="yellow">Tell me their name! I'll rip their
lips off, so tell me their name!</font>

242
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,700
<font color="yellow">Tell me their name, punk!</font>

243
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,799
<font color="yellow">I saw it myself.</font>

244
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

245
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,400
<font color="yellow">I saw it with my own eyes.</font>

246
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
<font color="yellow">I saw for myself...</font>

247
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,799
<font color="yellow">just how much of a miserable, selfish,
violent person Choi Hyun Joon is.</font>

248
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,299
<font color="yellow">Why did you love a scummy guy, Mom?</font>

249
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,900
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you
mistook someone else for him.</font>

250
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,299
<font color="yellow">You probably made a mistake!</font>

251
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,599
<font color="yellow">That man is the type of person who
gives poor people everything he has</font>

252
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,700
<font color="yellow">even if he can't eat what he wants to
because he has no money.</font>

253
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,799
<font color="yellow">When everyone treated me
like crap because I'm uneducated</font>

254
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,299
<font color="yellow">he hid the fact that he's a law
school student until the very end
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

255
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,000
<font color="yellow">and said that he was poor and uneducated
so I wouldn't feel bad about myself!</font>

256
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,200
<font color="yellow">He was so generous and
considerate toward me!</font>

257
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
<font color="yellow">Mom.
Eul's father...</font>

258
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,700
<font color="yellow">died due to a hit-and-run accident.</font>

259
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,099
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing that up now?</font>

260
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,200
<font color="yellow">And Mr. Choi Hyun Joon, who was
the Chief Prosecutor at the time...</font>

261
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,599
<font color="yellow">was so focused on
becoming more successful</font>

262
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,299
<font color="yellow">that he framed someone else as
the perpetrator of that crime.</font>

263
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

264
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,400
<font color="yellow">I thought that she'd gotten
over that incident</font>

265
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:56,900
<font color="yellow">and that she'd forgotten about it since
a lot of time has passed since then.</font>

266
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,200
<font color="yellow">But Eul still remembered.</font>

267
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,900
<font color="yellow">I thought that she was completely
over that incident by now...</font>

268
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:13,599
<font color="yellow">but it turns out that Eul is still
living in hell, being haunted.</font>

269
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:18,599
<font color="yellow">And Mr. Choi Hyun Joon,
who caused all this...</font>

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,400
<font color="yellow">had completely forgotten about
the incident altogether.</font>

271
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,599
<font color="yellow">And he's pretty much living in heaven.</font>

272
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,299
<font color="yellow">That's not right, Mom.</font>

273
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,200
<font color="yellow">Such things should never happen. Right?</font>

274
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,500
<font color="yellow">Jung Shik was right.</font>

275
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
<font color="yellow">You've become crazy for that gold-digger</font>

276
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,200
<font color="yellow">and you're not in your right mind.</font>

277
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

278
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:06,799
<font color="yellow">That man is the coolest, greatest,
most wonderful man in this whole world.</font>

279
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,299
<font color="yellow">He's a great man that a bastard like
you could never hope to measure up to!</font>

280
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,599
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!
You don't know anything!</font>

281
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,200
<font color="yellow">Also, how dare you call him
"Mr. Choi Hyun Joon?"</font>

282
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,900
<font color="yellow">- He's your father!
- And then!</font>

283
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,400
<font color="yellow">I almost killed Eul.</font>

284
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,200
<font color="yellow">I acknowledged such a
disgusting man as my father</font>

285
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,799
<font color="yellow">and I was trying to help him
cover that up.</font>

286
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,200
<font color="yellow">And in doing so, I almost killed Eul.</font>

287
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,799
<font color="yellow"><i>So...</i></font>

288
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
<font color="yellow"><i>is that why you dropped
out of school, too?</i></font>

289
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,599
<font color="yellow">Is that why...</font>

290
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,400
<font color="yellow">you said that you have no right
to become a prosecutor?</font>

291
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,599
<font color="yellow">And that you were rotten
to the core from the start?</font>

292
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,099
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

293
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,500
<font color="yellow">How could I accuse others of committing
crimes, after doing such a thing?</font>

294
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,400
<font color="yellow">On his way here,
he was held up by his fans.</font>

295
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,200
<font color="yellow">So he was delayed by
two hours and thirty minutes.</font>

296
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,900
<font color="yellow">And then, the traffic light
broke on his way here...</font>

297
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,700
<font color="yellow">so he was delayed for another
hour and 50 minutes.</font>

298
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,599
<font color="yellow">And then, he ran out of gas
so he had to go and refuel.</font>

299
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,400
<font color="yellow">And he had to get an oil change, too.</font>

300
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,000
<font color="yellow">And since he was there already,
he got his car washed, too.</font>

301
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,000
<font color="yellow"><i>He has 43 more kilometers left to go.</i></font>

302
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,000
<font color="yellow"><i>42.9 kilometers left.</i></font>

303
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
<font color="yellow"><i>42.8 kilometers left.</i></font>

304
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,900
<font color="yellow">How could something like this happen?</font>

305
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:19,599
<font color="yellow">Um, I have such great hearing that
I heard your entire conversation.</font>

306
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:29,000
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm planning to let
Joon Young out after I drop you off.</font>

307
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,799
<font color="yellow">If I leave a punk with his temper alone
like that, he might just end up dying.</font>

308
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,200
<font color="yellow">I heard you won't be able to see her
even if you try to go visit her now.</font>

309
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,599
<font color="yellow"><i>My name is Shin Joon Young.</i></font>

310
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Is Assemblyman Choi Hyun Joon home?</i></font>

311
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,599
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he not home?</i></font>

312
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,299
<font color="yellow">No, he's not home right now.</font>

313
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,599
<font color="yellow">He came home not long ago, though.</font>

314
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,400
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Did someone come?</font>

315
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,299
<font color="yellow">- No, nobody--
- Joon Young is here, Dad!</font>

316
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,700
<font color="yellow">Ow! That hurts, Mom!</font>

317
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,400
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, Joon Young?</font>

318
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,700
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I think they came to
the wrong house by accident.</font>

319
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,599
<font color="yellow">Go in and study, already.</font>

320
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,200
<font color="yellow">Now!</font>

321
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,500
<font color="yellow">By Joon Young...</font>

322
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,299
<font color="yellow">does she mean that Shin Joon Young
that Ha Ru likes so much?</font>

323
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah! That's right, Dad!</font>

324
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,400
<font color="yellow">But, why would Shin Joon Young
come to our house?</font>

325
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. We can't just allow anyone
to see the assemblyman, you see.</font>

326
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for dropping by
without any prior notice.</font>

327
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,500
<font color="yellow">Have you had dinner?</font>

328
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

329
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,599
<font color="yellow">Go to your room, Honey. And you too,
Ha Ru. Go to your room and study.</font>

330
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:45,400
<font color="yellow">I'm going to speak with our guest,
so don't come anywhere near my office.</font>

331
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
<font color="yellow">Please come this way.</font>

332
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not imagining things, right, Mom?</font>

333
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,200
<font color="yellow">Joon Young really came
to our house, right?</font>

334
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,299
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru. Can you support me, please?</font>

335
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,500
<font color="yellow">You don't look that great.
Have you been sick?</font>

336
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've been sick.</font>

337
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,799
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

338
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,799
<font color="yellow">So, why did come here so late
at night, when you're ill?</font>

339
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,500
<font color="yellow">Is it because of PD No Eul?</font>

340
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

341
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,799
<font color="yellow">That's what I assumed.</font>

342
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,299
<font color="yellow">But, attempted murder
is not a petty charge</font>

343
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,299
<font color="yellow">so this won't all be solved just
because I cancel my lawsuit against her.</font>

344
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:55,799
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you're aware of that
much too, Mr. Shin Joon Young.</font>

345
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,400
<font color="yellow">I found out that she was merely
being charged for reckless driving</font>

346
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,700
<font color="yellow">but the charge was changed
to attempted murder within the week.</font>

347
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,000
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind?</font>

348
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,900
<font color="yellow">Because it's a fact
that she meant to kill me.</font>

349
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,700
<font color="yellow">And why would she try to kill you?</font>

350
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,400
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about that myself.</font>

351
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,000
<font color="yellow">I heard that she is maintaining
her right to remain silent</font>

352
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,400
<font color="yellow">so can you go and
ask her for me, please?</font>

353
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,799
<font color="yellow">Ask her why she tried to kill me.</font>

354
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
<font color="yellow">If she'd really meant to kill you</font>

355
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,400
<font color="yellow">she would've had many chances
to take your life the past five years.</font>

356
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:45,200
<font color="yellow">If she'd really meant to kill you,
she wouldn't have swerved away from you.</font>

357
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,400
<font color="yellow">- Look here, Mr. Shin Joon Young!
- Of course, if I were her...</font>

358
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:56,000
<font color="yellow">I definitely wouldn't have swerved.</font>

359
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,599
<font color="yellow">Yong Deuk.</font>

360
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,000
<font color="yellow">Can you tell the hospital</font>

361
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,199
<font color="yellow">I'll be sending a patient their way, so
they should stay open for a bit longer?</font>

362
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,900
<font color="yellow">It's a shame that I can't
help you even though</font>

363
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,500
<font color="yellow">you, a famous star, took time out of
your busy schedule to come see me.</font>

364
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,699
<font color="yellow">Oh, also, thank you again for going
as far as to get hurt to save me--</font>

365
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,300
<font color="yellow">I regret doing that.</font>

366
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,900
<font color="yellow">I harbor no ill will toward you.</font>

367
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,199
<font color="yellow">I can't explain it, exactly.</font>

368
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:30,599
<font color="yellow">But would you believe me if I told you
I feel strangely close to you, somehow?</font>

369
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
<font color="yellow">My daughter is a huge fan of yours, too.</font>

370
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,699
<font color="yellow">So please, let's have a meal
together sometime--</font>

371
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,099
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

372
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,300
<font color="yellow">I'd like it...</font>

373
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,199
<font color="yellow">if we'd never have to
see each other again.</font>

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,699
<font color="yellow">I'd like it...</font>

375
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,300
<font color="yellow">if today is the last day
we ever see each other.</font>

376
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,000
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

377
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
<font color="yellow">I came to blackmail
Assemblyman Choi Hyun Joon.</font>

378
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,900
<font color="yellow">Well?</font>

379
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,000
<font color="yellow">Did you succeed?</font>

380
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

381
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:16,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Detective Im.
It's me.</font>

382
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,300
<font color="yellow">- About that girl, No Eul--
- You can't!</font>

383
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,000
<font color="yellow">You can't let that damned girl go free!</font>

384
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,199
<font color="yellow">If you do, she'll just try
to kill you again!</font>

385
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,199
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

386
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,500
<font color="yellow">You're Choi Hyun Joon!</font>

387
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,699
<font color="yellow">You can't succumb to the threats of
some lowlife like Shin Joon Young!</font>

388
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:37,199
<font color="yellow">Please, honey!</font>

389
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:21,900
<font color="yellow"><i>If Eul had taken that flash drive to
a broadcasting company five years ago...</i></font>

390
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,400
<font color="yellow">If only you hadn't taken that
flash drive from her five years ago...</font>

391
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop right there!
Hey, stop right there!</font>

392
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,199
<font color="yellow"><i>If we'd just received the punishment
that we deserved back then...</i></font>

393
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,400
<font color="yellow">If everyone just received the punishment
that they deserved back then...</font>

394
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Eul would be living a
completely different life now.</i></font>

395
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why you don't
deserve her, either!</i></font>

396
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,699
<font color="yellow">You have no right to be by her side
and smile beside her, either</font>

397
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:05,300
<font color="yellow">and you have no right to have
her make you happy, either!</font>

398
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,300
<font color="yellow"><i>You have no right, just like me!</i></font>

399
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,699
<font color="yellow">Because you can't help the fact that you
are Choi Hyun Joon's son, just like me.</font>

400
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,400
<font color="yellow">Eul!</font>

401
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:27,000
<font color="yellow">That was hard on you, wasn't it?</font>

402
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
<font color="yellow">No, it was fine. It was fun,
thanks to that Mario Lee lady.</font>

403
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,599
<font color="yellow">Stupid girl.
Here, eat this.</font>

404
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,599
<font color="yellow">Make sure you don't go anywhere near
Choi Hyun Joon from now on, okay?</font>

405
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,500
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for someone?</font>

406
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,500
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for Shin Joon Young?</font>

407
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,199
<font color="yellow">I told you, that bastard isn't coming!</font>

408
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,800
<font color="yellow">If he was coming at all,
he would've come sooner!</font>

409
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,800
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Jik here yet?</font>

410
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
Are you all right?</font>

411
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,199
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

412
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,300
<font color="yellow">Ow!</font>

413
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,400
<font color="yellow">Oh no! Shouldn't you go to the hospital?</font>

414
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,599
<font color="yellow"><i>[Na Ri]</i></font>

415
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:29,900
<font color="yellow"><i>The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable.</i></font>

416
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,800
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Jik picking up?</font>

417
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,199
<font color="yellow">I told you, Joon Young isn't coming!</font>

418
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,300
<font color="yellow">Stop waiting for him!</font>

419
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,500
<font color="yellow">You still don't get it?</font>

420
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,199
<font color="yellow">He's avoiding you</font>

421
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:52,300
<font color="yellow">because he doesn't want to be associated
with someone who went to jail!</font>

422
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,800
<font color="yellow">I'll just wait for him for ten minutes.</font>

423
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,199
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

424
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,099
<font color="yellow">This won't do.
Let's go home.</font>

425
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:04,300
<font color="yellow">Tell Jik to come home, too.
Come on, let's go.</font>

426
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,599
<font color="yellow">- Come on, hurry!
- Let go!</font>

427
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,400
<font color="yellow">- Jik!
- Jik!</font>

428
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,300
<font color="yellow">- Big Sis!
- What happened? Are you hurt?</font>

429
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,500
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- No, I'm fine.</font>

430
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,400
<font color="yellow">I just sprained it a little.</font>

431
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I got a bit distracted
while driving, and didn't see him.</font>

432
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,300
<font color="yellow">I'm really all right, Big Sis!</font>

433
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
<font color="yellow">What about you?
Are you okay?</font>

434
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,199
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

435
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,800
<font color="yellow">I told him we should get him
checked at the hospital</font>

436
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,300
<font color="yellow">but he insisted on coming here.</font>

437
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,599
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

438
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,800
<font color="yellow">Secretary Kim really isn't the
type to make such mistakes.</font>

439
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,199
<font color="yellow">Something terrible could've happened.</font>

440
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,599
<font color="yellow">If she'd stepped on the
brakes just a bit later...</font>

441
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't even want to think about it.</font>

442
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,599
<font color="yellow">PD No Eul was released this morning.</font>

443
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,599
<font color="yellow">As for the engagement party,
we've scheduled it for 4:30 p.m.</font>

444
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,099
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

445
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:30,699
<font color="yellow">What... is all this? Huh?</font>

446
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:32,000
<font color="yellow">You told everyone not to come</font>

447
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,900
<font color="yellow">yet you were just drinking and playing
games instead of eating, this whole time?</font>

448
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.</font>

449
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,500
<font color="yellow">If you tell me, "I don't want to
see your damn face, so go and die"</font>

450
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,400
<font color="yellow">I can just die right
here and now, for you.</font>

451
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,000
<font color="yellow">But I regret nothing.</font>

452
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,699
<font color="yellow">I think that I've fulfilled my duty
by keeping you safe and sound</font>

453
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:57,699
<font color="yellow">without a scratch on you,
amidst all this craziness.</font>

454
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,800
<font color="yellow">You call this "keeping him safe
and sound?" Huh? As if!</font>

455
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,400
<font color="yellow">I took this ailing, dying child,
mustered some courage</font>

456
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,000
<font color="yellow">and brought him back to life!</font>

457
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,500
<font color="yellow">But look at him.
He's only playing video games.</font>

458
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,099
<font color="yellow">Geez. Oh, yeah.
Hey.</font>

459
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:15,900
<font color="yellow">I heard that PD No Eul was freed today,
and all charges were dropped.</font>

460
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,300
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going?</font>

461
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,900
<font color="yellow">- Ow!
- Why would our Joon Young go there?</font>

462
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,699
<font color="yellow">But still, he should go!
He was so desperate to see her!</font>

463
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,199
<font color="yellow">As if!</font>

464
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:39,199
<font color="yellow"><i>If Eul had taken that flash drive to a
broadcasting company five years ago...</i></font>

465
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,599
<font color="yellow"><i>If only you hadn't taken that
flash drive from her five years ago...</i></font>

466
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,099
<font color="yellow"><i>If everyone just received the punishment
that they deserved back then...</i></font>

467
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,900
<font color="yellow"><i>If only we'd paid the price for
the crimes that we committed...</i></font>

468
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Eul would be living a
completely different life now.</i></font>

469
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,199
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- You little punk!</font>

470
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:05,500
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you today!</font>

471
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,099
<font color="yellow">- Joon Young?
- Joon Young!</font>

472
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,800
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why you don't
deserve her, either!</i></font>

473
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,199
<font color="yellow"><i>You have no right to be by her side
and smile beside her, either</i></font>

474
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,599
<font color="yellow">and you have no right to have
her make you happy, either!</font>

475
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,699
<font color="yellow"><i>You have no right,
just like me!</i></font>

476
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,699
<font color="yellow"><i>Because you can't help the fact that you
are Choi Hyun Joon's son, just like me.</i></font>

477
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,199
<font color="yellow">How dare you come here?</font>

478
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,800
<font color="yellow">What mess are you going to get
Joon Young involved in this time?</font>

479
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,500
<font color="yellow">Joon Young isn't going to
play with you anymore.</font>

480
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,400
<font color="yellow">So go on and piss off,
while I'm still being nice about it.</font>

481
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:54,000
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

482
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,400
<font color="yellow">W-what?</font>

483
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,000
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that I'm
not going to piss off.</font>

484
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,599
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to come
and go as you please.</font>

485
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,800
<font color="yellow">Joon Young didn't even come
to see you once, right?</font>

486
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,699
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you know
Joon Young well enough</font>

487
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:15,900
<font color="yellow">to know that nothing would've
stopped him if he wanted to see you.</font>

488
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,800
<font color="yellow">I mean, he certainly has
the means to do so.</font>

489
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,599
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you've realized the nature
of the situation, if you're not an idiot.</font>

490
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:27,800
<font color="yellow">Joon Young got drunk and
confessed the truth last night.</font>

491
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,400
<font color="yellow">He said that people shouldn't love
someone out of feelings of loyalty.</font>

492
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
<font color="yellow">He also said, "I'm sure that
damn girl is going to come see me</font>

493
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,500
<font color="yellow">and cling to me when
she gets released."</font>

494
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,800
<font color="yellow">"Just thinking about that makes
me feel sick to my stomach."</font>

495
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,099
<font color="yellow">Liar.</font>

496
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,599
<font color="yellow"><i>[Na Ri]</i></font>

497
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,599
<font color="yellow"><i>This is Na Ri.
Go Na Ri.</i></font>

498
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,400
<font color="yellow"><i>There's something I'm curious about.</i></font>

499
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,199
<font color="yellow"><i>Why didn't you come by
even once to visit Eul?</i></font>

500
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:13,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Just because.</i></font>

501
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
<font color="yellow"><i>"Just because?"</i></font>

502
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:20,199
<font color="yellow"><i>How... how could you do that to Eul?
She waited so much for you!</i></font>

503
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:22,000
<font color="yellow"><i>Sorry, Na Ri...</i></font>

504
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,400
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't really talk for a long time--</i></font>

505
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,699
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't want to talk to you
for a long time either, you bastard!</i></font>

506
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I should've kept Eul from going!</i></font>

507
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,000
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?
Where is Eul going?</font>

508
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,800
<font color="yellow">Stop crying, and talk properly!</font>

509
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,400
<font color="yellow">Go Na Ri!</font>

510
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,800
<font color="yellow"><i>I was hoping that we'd
never see each other again.</i></font>

511
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,300
<font color="yellow">Do you remember when
I told you after the trial</font>

512
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:19,900
<font color="yellow">that I never wanted to see you again,
and I wanted to end our bad relationship?</font>

513
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,800
<font color="yellow">So why didn't you listen?
Why are you still hanging around me?</font>

514
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,300
<font color="yellow">Did you want to test me to see
just how far I'll go?</font>

515
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,300
<font color="yellow">Your younger brother is quite
clever and respectable.</font>

516
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,199
<font color="yellow">He seems like the type of little brother
who could grow up to be someone great</font>

517
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,900
<font color="yellow">and take care of you,
as long as you heed my command.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Shin Joon Young]</i></font>

519
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:24,000
<font color="yellow">What do you want, so late at night?</font>

520
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,000
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

521
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,500
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your engagement,
my daughter!</font>

522
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,800
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Dad.</font>

523
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,599
<font color="yellow">They say that one's first love
usually ends in failure.</font>

524
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,699
<font color="yellow">This is all thanks to you.</font>

525
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:58,599
<font color="yellow">I'll never forget this favor
you've done for me!</font>

526
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,599
<font color="yellow">Choi Ji Tae, who my daughter
is getting engaged to today</font>

527
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,699
<font color="yellow">is my daughter's first love.</font>

528
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:07,900
<font color="yellow">Others say that it's a marriage of
convenience for the two families</font>

529
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,000
<font color="yellow">but none of that is true!</font>

530
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,800
<font color="yellow">Dad, why are you saying that?</font>

531
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:19,199
<font color="yellow">Her friends wrote "lawyer," "doctor," or
"famous pianist" as their aspirations</font>

532
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,500
<font color="yellow">my daughter wrote...</font>

533
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,800
<font color="yellow">What did you write, again?</font>

534
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:29,400
<font color="yellow">"Choi Ji Tae's wife."</font>

535
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:38,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, you did! She's a fool who's
loved one man for almost 20 years!</font>

536
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so nervous.</font>

537
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:48,000
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm going to go
crazy because I'm so nervous!</font>

538
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,900
<font color="yellow">Dad, you don't have an
anxiety reliever on you, do you?</font>

539
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,599
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Aren't you getting in?</font>

540
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,500
<font color="yellow">You're really not going to tell me?</font>

541
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,800
<font color="yellow">What happened that you're running
away without even telling Na Ri?</font>

542
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,400
<font color="yellow">What, did the loan sharks say that
they'd kill you if you didn't pay them?</font>

543
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,599
<font color="yellow">There's no time.
Hurry and get in.</font>

544
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,900
<font color="yellow">How can we leave Mom and Dad
behind in this country, and go?</font>

545
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,199
<font color="yellow">How are you going to get by overseas
when your English is terrible?</font>

546
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:17,500
<font color="yellow">What are you going to eat?</font>

547
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,699
<font color="yellow">- Even so, it's better than here.
- What?</font>

00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,250
<font color="yellow">No matter where we go</font>

549
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,800

than this crappy place!</font>

556
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,300

557
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
<font color="yellow">Get out of there right now, No Eul!</font>

558
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,199
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

559
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:30,199
<font color="yellow">This one doesn't work, either?</font>

560
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:31,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me,
when you already know?</font>

561
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any cash on you?</font>

562
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,800
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.
I'm sure I do.</font>

563
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,199
<font color="yellow">What kind of lawyer doesn't
even have 10,000 won on them?</font>
