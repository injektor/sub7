<font color="yellow">Flowers bloom in the summer</font>

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,650
<font color="yellow">Whenever my mum was in a good mood,</font>

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,690
<font color="yellow">she sang this song.</font>

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,590
<font color="yellow">In winter, I'll be happy</font>

13

<font color="yellow">"On a green field,"</font>

<font color="yellow">"And live with my love..."</font>

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,010
<font color="yellow">"for the rest of my life."</font>

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,250
<font color="yellow">That's how the song began.</font>

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,770
<font color="yellow">I don't know since when it was,</font>

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,850
<font color="yellow">but I naturally ended up with a dream.</font>

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,290
<font color="yellow">A dream to build a picturesque house...</font>

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,170
<font color="yellow">on a green field...</font>

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,250
<font color="yellow">and live there happily...</font>

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,710
<font color="yellow">for a long, long time with my love.</font>

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,090
<font color="yellow">Live with my love for 100 years</font>

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,290
<font color="yellow">Even when I found out I didn't have much time left,</font>

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,690
<font color="yellow">I didn't give up on my dream.</font>

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
<font color="yellow">I only...</font>

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,160
<font color="yellow">shortened the time from 100 years...</font>

<font color="yellow">(Noh Eul)</font>

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,030
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,190
<font color="yellow">there's 5m left.</font>

33
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,870

<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 1m left.)</font>

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,550
<font color="yellow">It may not be 100 years,</font>

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
<font color="yellow">but I will spend...</font>

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,680
<font color="yellow">the time I have left...</font>

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,590
<font color="yellow">loving the person I love.</font>

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,630
<font color="yellow">So let's not be sad...</font>

43
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,750
<font color="yellow">or upset.</font>

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,230
<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 20km left.)</font>

45
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,400
<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 19km left.)</font>

<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 17km left.)</font>

47

<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 16km left.)</font>

48

<font color="yellow">(Now, there's 1m left.)</font>

49
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,710
<font color="yellow">Now, there's zero distance left.</font>

50
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,910
<font color="yellow">Let's give up.</font>

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,870
<font color="yellow">Joon Young won't show up.</font>

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,430
<font color="yellow">It's over.</font>

53
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,350
<font color="yellow">It's really over.</font>

54
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,510
<font color="yellow">(Let's give up. Joon Young won't show up. It's over.)</font>

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,710
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Where are you going?</font>

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,430
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to leave Korea.</font>

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,810
<font color="yellow">But now,</font>

58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,770
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give up on...</font>

59
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,930
<font color="yellow">the last dream I ever had.</font>

60
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,330
<font color="yellow">I won't spend the rest of my life...</font>

61
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,820
<font color="yellow">living in a picturesque house with Eul.</font>

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,170
<font color="yellow">Instead, I will return the truth and justice...</font>

63
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,170
<font color="yellow">that I took from her.</font>

64
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,090
<font color="yellow">Lend me 10 dollars. I'll pay you back tomorrow.</font>

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,730
<font color="yellow">What about the 50 dollars you took last time?</font>

66
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,970
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you everything back tomorrow.</font>

67
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,290
<font color="yellow">You might as well lend me 30 dollars.</font>

68
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,770
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm not an ATM.</font>

69
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,850
<font color="yellow">Here. It's for the food you bought me.</font>

70
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,050
<font color="yellow">Who really hit Mr Noh Jang Soo?</font>

71
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,530
<font color="yellow">Who do you think it was?</font>

72
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,570
<font color="yellow">They caught the culprit.</font>

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,810
<font color="yellow">I don't mean the man Choi Hyun Joon offered up.</font>

74
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
<font color="yellow">Who's the real culprit?</font>

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,570
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

76
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,410
<font color="yellow">Go before I turn nasty.</font>

77
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,970
<font color="yellow">I can sue you for obstruction and invasion of privacy.</font>

78
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,450
<font color="yellow">So when I'm gone, I hope Eul will have overcome...</font>

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,170
<font color="yellow">the long, cold winter...</font>

80
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,210
<font color="yellow">and start living...</font>

81
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,850
<font color="yellow">a warm, clear and springlike life.</font>

82
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,730
<font color="yellow">You are not going anywhere.</font>

83
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,570
<font color="yellow">Get off right now, Eul.</font>

84
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,370
<font color="yellow">Get out, Eul!</font>

85
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,410
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

86
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,130
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about this.</font>

87
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,370
<font color="yellow">Can you open the trunk, please?</font>

88
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,850
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

89
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,050
<font color="yellow">No, don't unload my bags.</font>

90
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,010
<font color="yellow">Unload her stuff.</font>

91
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,570
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

92
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,670
<font color="yellow">Jik, can you take her suitcase upstairs?</font>

93
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,450
<font color="yellow">- Mister.
-  Now.</font>

94
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,970
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

95
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,530
<font color="yellow">Do explain later why you disappeared for so long.</font>

96
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,050
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

97
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,860
<font color="yellow">Jik, wait.</font>

98
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,140
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

99
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,170
<font color="yellow">Jik!</font>

100
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,830
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

101
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,170
<font color="yellow">Where were you until now?</font>

102
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,290
<font color="yellow">You don't have to run away.</font>

103
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,930
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

104
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,690
<font color="yellow">Did Na Ri tell you?</font>

105
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,810
<font color="yellow">I found out somehow.</font>

106
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,690
<font color="yellow">I heard Congressman Choi's wife threatened you...</font>

107
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,650
<font color="yellow">and that she's the reason why you're running away.</font>

108
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,130
<font color="yellow">Then don't stop me.</font>

109
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,410
<font color="yellow">Losing my dad was enough.</font>

110
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,250
<font color="yellow">I won't lose Jik, too.</font>

111
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,650
<font color="yellow">Will you take responsibility if I miss my flight?</font>

112
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,130
<font color="yellow">Jik, bring back all the bags!</font>

113
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,130
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

114
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,470
<font color="yellow">You should also leave and stop being my friend.</font>

115
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,750
<font color="yellow">If you end up getting hurt, then...</font>

116
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,770
<font color="yellow">I'll stop it!</font>

117
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,970
<font color="yellow">I'll stop it.</font>

118
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,340
<font color="yellow">Those people are much scarier than you think.</font>

119
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,650
<font color="yellow">They aren't the kind of people we can deal with.</font>

120
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,770
<font color="yellow">They're my parents!</font>

121
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,450
<font color="yellow">Congressman Choi's my father.</font>

122
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,210
<font color="yellow">Madam Lee's my mother.</font>

123
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,090
<font color="yellow">I am their son.</font>

124
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,690
<font color="yellow">That one was funny.</font>

125
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,690
<font color="yellow">Your jokes are usually really lame.</font>

126
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,930
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,250
<font color="yellow">Was it not a joke?</font>

128
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,290
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

129
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
<font color="yellow">It wasn't.</font>

130
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,570
<font color="yellow">But your name is...</font>

131
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,530
<font color="yellow">Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

132
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,790
<font color="yellow">Your last name should be Choi.</font>

133
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

134
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,050
<font color="yellow">I deceived you.</font>

135
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,430
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

136
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,650
<font color="yellow">Don't come closer.</font>

137
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,810
<font color="yellow">- Eul.
-  Don't come closer.</font>

138
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,130
<font color="yellow">Don't come any closer.</font>

139
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,980
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

140
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,770
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I took her USB...</font>

141
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,820
<font color="yellow">and almost got her killed.</font>

142
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,730
<font color="yellow">It was terrible, but at least that's what I did.</font>

143
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,980
<font color="yellow">But what did you do?</font>

144
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,980
<font color="yellow">What did you do...</font>

145
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,130
<font color="yellow">when your parents...</font>

146
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,250
<font color="yellow">threatened her...</font>

147
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,290
<font color="yellow">and tried to send her abroad?</font>

148
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,980
<font color="yellow">Where's the fiance? He's 10 minutes late.</font>

149
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,730
<font color="yellow">It must be the traffic.</font>

150
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,050
<font color="yellow">(Mum)</font>

151
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,730
<font color="yellow">He won't pick up?</font>

152
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,050
<font color="yellow">Has he gone insane?</font>

153
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,370
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

154
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,810
<font color="yellow">It's your daughter's birthday, right?</font>

155
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

156
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,330
<font color="yellow">I won't until you tell me who really did it.</font>

157
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,970
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

158
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,490
<font color="yellow">I told you that...</font>

159
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,410
<font color="yellow">the real culprit turned himself in.</font>

160
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,050
<font color="yellow">This coat of yours.</font>

161
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,370
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit you at all.</font>

162
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,770
<font color="yellow">It's ruining your handsome looks.</font>

163
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,410
<font color="yellow">Would you like all my coats?</font>

164
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,980
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come here.</font>

165
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,370
<font color="yellow">I'm her dad.</font>

166
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,490
<font color="yellow">Her dad?</font>

167
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,540
<font color="yellow">You're not a dad.</font>

168
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,740
<font color="yellow">You have no right to call yourself that.</font>

169
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,020
<font color="yellow">Bo Ram doesn't consider you her dad, either.</font>

170
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,050
<font color="yellow">So go away.</font>

171
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,230
<font color="yellow">- I don't believe this.
-  What?</font>

172
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,480
<font color="yellow">Give me my cell phone.</font>

173
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,610
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young's in room 6101.</font>

174
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,930
<font color="yellow">- Really?
-  Yes.</font>

175
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,760
<font color="yellow">He said he's Shin Joon Young,</font>

176
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,390
<font color="yellow">but he's way more handsome in person.</font>

177
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,130
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  Let's go.</font>

178
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,570
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

179
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,010
<font color="yellow">- Is it really him?
-  Unbelievable.</font>

180
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,330
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday, Bo Ram.</font>

181
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,450
<font color="yellow">It's really me.</font>

182
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,290
<font color="yellow">What should I do to convince you all?</font>

183
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,800
<font color="yellow">"Hello, Chester."</font>

184
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,750
<font color="yellow">- You sounded like him.
-  Right?</font>

185
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,010
<font color="yellow">- It must be him.
-  You're right.</font>

186
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,450
<font color="yellow">Didn't you watch any of my dramas?</font>

187
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,290
<font color="yellow">You have to know this, then.</font>

188
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,370
<font color="yellow">"Don't give me that look."</font>

189
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,390
<font color="yellow">"It makes me nervous."</font>

190
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,170
<font color="yellow">"Hello, new kid."</font>

191
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,540
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

192
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,010
<font color="yellow">I knew you were the smartest the second I came in.</font>

193
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,090
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
-  But how does a famous person like you...</font>

194
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,090
<font color="yellow">know Bo Ram?</font>

195
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,210
<font color="yellow">I'm a fan of...</font>

196
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,330
<font color="yellow">Bo Ram's dad.</font>

197
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,530
<font color="yellow">Her dad used to be a prosecutor,</font>

198
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,090
<font color="yellow">and I respect him more than anyone.</font>

199
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,130
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

200
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,010
<font color="yellow">Do you really respect him more than anyone?</font>

201
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,410
<font color="yellow">You bet. Of all the people I know,</font>

202
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,750
<font color="yellow">your dad is the bravest, most just,</font>

203
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,690
<font color="yellow">most handsome and greatest man.</font>

204
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,490
<font color="yellow">His only flaw is his poor sense of fashion.</font>

205
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,610
<font color="yellow">If only my father were...</font>

206
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,170
<font color="yellow">as great a guy as Bo Ram's dad.</font>

207
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,410
<font color="yellow">Bo Ram.</font>

208
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,610
<font color="yellow">I envy you so much.</font>

209
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,370
<font color="yellow">Here you are.</font>

210
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,570
<font color="yellow">That's gross.</font>

211
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating something that fell on the floor?</font>

212
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,610
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie to her?</font>

213
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't lie.</font>

214
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,850
<font color="yellow">I do respect you more than anyone,</font>

215
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,850
<font color="yellow">other than my mum.</font>

216
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,210
<font color="yellow">"About Noh Jang Soo's hit-and-run."</font>

217
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,890
<font color="yellow">"Someone else will take the fall."</font>

218
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,010
<font color="yellow">"So cover up the investigation..."</font>

219
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,290
<font color="yellow">"and follow my orders from now on."</font>

220
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,210
<font color="yellow">"Then your sick daughter..."</font>

221
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,580
<font color="yellow">"will get operated at the best hospital in Korea..."</font>

222
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,350
<font color="yellow">"and it'll all be paid for."</font>

223
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,010
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
-  That is what...</font>

224
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,370
<font color="yellow">the then senior prosecutor, Choi Hyun Joon, said...</font>

225
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,610
<font color="yellow">to you, the then prosecutor in charge.</font>

226
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,860
<font color="yellow">- Look, Mr Shin.
-  "Look, Mr Choi."</font>

227
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,310
<font color="yellow">"Must I cover up the truth to save my daughter's life?"</font>

228
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,530
<font color="yellow">"I can't do that."</font>

229
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,610
<font color="yellow">That is what you said.</font>

230
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,770
<font color="yellow">For that, you got demoted to a regional office.</font>

231
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,590
<font color="yellow">You couldn't stand the stigma and ridicule,</font>

232
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,310
<font color="yellow">and so you quit your job.</font>

233
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,290
<font color="yellow">What little conscience you had bothered you so much,</font>

234
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,580
<font color="yellow">so your wife divorced you and your child distrusts you.</font>

235
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,650
<font color="yellow">Take your dramatisation to the set.</font>

236
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,890
<font color="yellow">I don't have...</font>

237
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,010
<font color="yellow">much longer to live.</font>

238
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,050
<font color="yellow">When I die,</font>

239
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,870
<font color="yellow">the truth will die with me.</font>

240
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,890
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

241
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,490
<font color="yellow">share the burden you must carry forever.</font>

242
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,580
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

243
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,610
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

244
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,930
<font color="yellow">Keep that stupid plot for your next drama.</font>

245
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,860
<font color="yellow">You insane jerk.</font>

246
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,770
<font color="yellow">Congressman Choi...</font>

247
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,770
<font color="yellow">is my father.</font>

248
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,530
<font color="yellow">He doesn't know...</font>

249
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,580
<font color="yellow">I'm his, though.</font>

250
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,450
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

251
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,490
<font color="yellow">Mr Noh Jang Soo, the victim of the hit-and-run,</font>

252
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,050
<font color="yellow">is the father of the woman I love.</font>

253
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,950
<font color="yellow">I'm well-known for holding grudges...</font>

254
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,210
<font color="yellow">and never letting things go.</font>

255
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,130
<font color="yellow">If I die without doing anything,</font>

256
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,650
<font color="yellow">I'll become a ghost and haunt you every night.</font>

257
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,100
<font color="yellow">That's not a lie.</font>

258
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,010
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

259
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,050
<font color="yellow">My name is Noh Eul.</font>

260
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,840
<font color="yellow">Please let me in.</font>

261
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,930
<font color="yellow">No one's at home.</font>

262
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,970
<font color="yellow">That's a lie.</font>

263
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,100
<font color="yellow">Let me in.</font>

264
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,740
<font color="yellow">It's true. No one's at home.</font>

265
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,340
<font color="yellow">I must speak with the congressman and his wife.</font>

266
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,000
<font color="yellow">Let me in.</font>

267
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,770
<font color="yellow">I promise you that no one's here. Go home.</font>

268
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,410
<font color="yellow">I know that this is pointless,</font>

269
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,450
<font color="yellow">and I know that you can crush me like I'm nothing.</font>

270
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,580
<font color="yellow">That's why I told my dad...</font>

271
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,610
<font color="yellow">to hold back...</font>

272
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,050
<font color="yellow">and to forget about it all and die in peace.</font>

273
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,370
<font color="yellow">If it bothers him that much,</font>

274
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,050
<font color="yellow">he can be born again as a rich and powerful man.</font>

275
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,890
<font color="yellow">That's what I told him.</font>

276
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,890
<font color="yellow">I meant to disappear from your lives.</font>

277
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,770
<font color="yellow">You wanted me gone, so I was going to get lost.</font>

278
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,370
<font color="yellow">I was going to live in silence and out of sight...</font>

279
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,580
<font color="yellow">as if I were dead, just like you wanted.</font>

280
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
<font color="yellow">But why are you doing this?</font>

281
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,130
<font color="yellow">Why did you send your son to spy on me?</font>

282
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,200
<font color="yellow">Did I scare you that much?</font>

283
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,620
<font color="yellow">What's so scary about me?</font>

284
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,560
<font color="yellow">I'm such a coward.</font>

285
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,650
<font color="yellow">You could walk all over me, and I'd never make a sound.</font>

286
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,280
<font color="yellow">People like you are the scary ones, not me!</font>

287
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

288
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Mum?</font>

289
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,920
<font color="yellow">Should we go to the hospital?</font>

290
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,640
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

291
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine.</font>

292
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,920
<font color="yellow">How could Ji Tae do this?</font>

293
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,770
<font color="yellow">Him of all people.</font>

294
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,440
<font color="yellow">How could he insult you and Dad so badly?</font>

295
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,000
<font color="yellow">Is he on something?</font>

296
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
<font color="yellow">Ms Kim.</font>

297
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,120
<font color="yellow">He could have been in a car accident.</font>

298
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,740
<font color="yellow">Check with the police and hospitals again.</font>

299
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madam.</font>

300
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,200
<font color="yellow">- Where's Dad?
-  He's probably with Mr Yoon.</font>

301
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,280
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun looked really scary today.</font>

302
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,320
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'll hit Dad?</font>

303
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

304
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,700
<font color="yellow">I should've raised him better.</font>

305
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,880
<font color="yellow">Is Ji Tae...</font>

306
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
<font color="yellow">seeing someone else?</font>

307
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,440
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

308
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,360
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't do something like this.</font>

309
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,840
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure something urgent...
-  Send...</font>

310
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
<font color="yellow">Ji Tae...</font>

311
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,480
<font color="yellow">to Jeong Eun before the day ends.</font>

312
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,760
<font color="yellow">This marriage...</font>

313
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,120
<font color="yellow">is up to Jeong Eun, not you or anyone else.</font>

314
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
<font color="yellow">We'll be the ones to end it.</font>

315
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,680
<font color="yellow">However late it is, as long as he comes by,</font>

316
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,480
<font color="yellow">the two can still get engaged.</font>

317
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,760
<font color="yellow">Mr Yoon.</font>

318
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,160
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello.</font>

319
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,080
<font color="yellow">How did the ceremony go?</font>

320
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,760
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

321
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,230
<font color="yellow">How dare you put me in a dress like this.</font>

322
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,360
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

323
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,160
<font color="yellow">Did something go wrong?</font>

324
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,820
<font color="yellow">I couldn't get engaged because of this cheap dress.</font>

325
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,400
<font color="yellow">All because of this dress!</font>

326
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,480
<font color="yellow">Everyone saw me get stood up. There was no ceremony!</font>

327
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,100
<font color="yellow">Ms Yoon.</font>

328
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,620
<font color="yellow">Don't. Ms Yoon.</font>

329
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,280
<font color="yellow">- Don't do that.
-  Ms Yoon.</font>

330
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
<font color="yellow">Stop her.</font>

331
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

332
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,000
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry? Shall we eat?</font>

333
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

334
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

335
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
<font color="yellow">If I were to see you,</font>

336
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,000
<font color="yellow">would that upset your parents?</font>

337
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

338
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
<font color="yellow">If I were to date you or something,</font>

339
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
<font color="yellow">your parents...</font>

340
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
<font color="yellow">would feel devastated.</font>

341
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

342
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

343
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,320
<font color="yellow">It could be...</font>

344
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,960
<font color="yellow">the greatest way ever...</font>

345
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,480
<font color="yellow">to get back at them.</font>

346
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

347
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
<font color="yellow">Then let's date.</font>

348
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,880
<font color="yellow">You drank too much, Ms Yoon.</font>

349
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
<font color="yellow">Ms Yoon.</font>

350
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,840
<font color="yellow">How dare you boss me around.</font>

351
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
<font color="yellow">Know your place.</font>

352
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,560
<font color="yellow">Why can't I get drunk today?</font>

353
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
<font color="yellow">Hey, wake up.</font>

354
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,080
<font color="yellow">You still have a lot to do.</font>

355
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
<font color="yellow">You can't die without my permission.</font>

356
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

357
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,800
<font color="yellow">Ms Yoon! Ms Yoon.</font>

358
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,120
<font color="yellow">- Ms Yoon.
-  My goodness.</font>

359
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,080
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
-  Get her inside.</font>

360
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
<font color="yellow">Careful.</font>

361
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
<font color="yellow">It's too late.</font>

362
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
<font color="yellow">There's no evidence or witness.</font>

363
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,660
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you can do.</font>

364
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,800
<font color="yellow">I told you that...</font>

365
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,140
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever it takes to catch the person.</font>

366
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,720
<font color="yellow">Just tell me who did it.</font>

367
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
<font color="yellow">Please tell me before it's too late.</font>

368
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
<font color="yellow">It's Daehan Jeil Party's representative...</font>

369
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
<font color="yellow">Yoon Seong Ho's daughter,</font>

370
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
<font color="yellow">Yoon Jeong Eun.</font>

371
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,320
<font color="yellow">I have one now.</font>

372
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
<font color="yellow">A bucket list I want to fulfil before I die.</font>

373
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,560
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young's bucket list.</font>

374
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
<font color="yellow">This is exciting.</font>

375
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,960
<font color="yellow">Shall we begin, then?</font>

376
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,440
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's begin.</font>

377
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,120
<font color="yellow">Cut. That was great.</font>

378
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,180
<font color="yellow">Producer Yoon's a veteran for a reason.</font>

379
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,140
<font color="yellow">The show jumped to a whole new level.</font>

380
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,960
<font color="yellow">The camera angle and movement is just perfect.</font>

381
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you think, Gook Young?</font>

382
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, everything's different for sure.</font>

383
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
<font color="yellow">Go, Producer Yoon.</font>

384
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,320
<font color="yellow">Go, Producer Yoon.</font>

385
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,680
<font color="yellow">Nothing's changed.</font>

386
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,340
<font color="yellow">Producer Noh and him are pretty much the same.</font>

387
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,650
<font color="yellow">Man Ok.</font>

388
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,280
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit me?</font>

389
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,000
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry. You skipped lunch.</font>

390
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

391
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,370
<font color="yellow">I can get something to eat on the way back.</font>

392
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,730
<font color="yellow">If you aren't in a hurry, you can eat with us.</font>

393
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,320
<font color="yellow">Let's order Chinese food.</font>

394
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
<font color="yellow">I'll have jjamppong.</font>

395
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,960
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll have jjajangmyeon.</font>

396
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,610
<font color="yellow">Order tangsuyuk, too.</font>

397
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,760
<font color="yellow">Okay...</font>

398
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
<font color="yellow">Jjamppong.</font>

399
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
<font color="yellow">Producer Yoon.</font>

400
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,060
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
-  Pardon?</font>

401
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,120
<font color="yellow">I guess you prefer to dip it in the sauce, too.</font>

402
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,680
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I reacted instinctively.</font>

403
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
<font color="yellow">President Nam is so selfish.</font>

404
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
<font color="yellow">I told him many times that I prefer to dip tangsuyuk.</font>

405
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,880
<font color="yellow">You did. Sorry.</font>

406
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,620
<font color="yellow">I'm a birdbrain.</font>

407
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,040
<font color="yellow">I'm too stupid to run a talent agency.</font>

408
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
<font color="yellow">Gook Young, I'll retire. Do you want to take over?</font>

409
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,320
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'm cut out for this job.</font>

410
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
<font color="yellow">Man Ok, have you ever seen...</font>

411
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,020
<font color="yellow">someone become so awkward and sincere...</font>

412
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,400
<font color="yellow">over whether tangsuyuk should be poured or dipped?</font>

413
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
<font color="yellow">Someone I know...</font>

414
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,480
<font color="yellow">even wants to resign from being a president.</font>

415
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,340
<font color="yellow">I think he's overreacting because...</font>

416
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
<font color="yellow">he feels bad that he replaced Producer Noh with Mr Yoon.</font>

417
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,520
<font color="yellow">Correct.</font>

418
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,440
<font color="yellow">Was that a whisper?</font>

419
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,040
<font color="yellow">It was too loud.</font>

420
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,730
<font color="yellow">Speak freely.</font>

421
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,240
<font color="yellow">Everyone here knows about it.</font>

422
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,720
<font color="yellow">President Nam, just act like you normally do.</font>

423
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,100
<font color="yellow">You're new here, Producer Yoon.</font>

424
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,120
<font color="yellow">Let's all shoot a great show.</font>

425
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,850
<font color="yellow">We have the same taste in tangsuyuk.</font>

426
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,720
<font color="yellow">We'll get along very well.</font>

427
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,530
<font color="yellow">Let's do this.</font>

428
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,200
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  Hi, can I come in?</font>

429
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,460
<font color="yellow">The place reeks of a jobless person.</font>

430
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

431
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,020
<font color="yellow">Did you eat jjajang ramyeon?</font>

432
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,960
<font color="yellow">- How did you know?
-  Down here.</font>

433
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,200
<font color="yellow">- Producer Noh.
-  Yes?</font>

434
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,570
<font color="yellow">I'm here because Director Choi sent me,</font>

435
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,920
<font color="yellow">but I can't do it.</font>

436
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
<font color="yellow">Can't do what?</font>

437
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,840
<font color="yellow">The next time you see Director Choi,</font>

438
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,920
<font color="yellow">tell him that I really tried to make you take the job,</font>

439
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,900
<font color="yellow">but that you refused. Could you tell him that?</font>

440
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,640
<font color="yellow">- Please.
-  What?</font>

441
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,200
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

442
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

443
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,640
<font color="yellow">What's the job?</font>

444
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,720
<font color="yellow">It's something you can't do.</font>

445
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
<font color="yellow">Reporting on Seo Yoon Hoo's movie.</font>

446
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
<font color="yellow">Why can't I do that?</font>

447
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,530
<font color="yellow">Haven't you heard the rumours?</font>

448
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,390
<font color="yellow">He's mean, meticulous...</font>

449
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,370
<font color="yellow">and a hygiene freak.</font>

450
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,600
<font color="yellow">He even restricts the perfumes his staff wear.</font>

451
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,050
<font color="yellow">The basic measurements of the women around him...</font>

452
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,420
<font color="yellow">are all 34, 24, 35 inches in body size,</font>

453
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,120
<font color="yellow">and they have to be pretty enough to debut themselves.</font>

454
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,110
<font color="yellow">Plus, they have to shower at least twice a day.</font>

455
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,600
<font color="yellow">Why? Because Yoon Hoo hates dirt and bad smells.</font>

456
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,740
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

457
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,760
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

458
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,400
<font color="yellow">You must not look into a mirror at all.</font>

459
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,800
<font color="yellow">Up here, too.</font>

460
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
<font color="yellow">Take a break while you're at it.</font>

461
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,530
<font color="yellow">I'll find a job that's perfect for you.</font>

462
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,580
<font color="yellow">Talk to Director Choi for me.</font>

463
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,640
<font color="yellow">Please help me. See you.</font>

464
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,200
<font color="yellow">She should at least wash her face.</font>

465
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,010
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

466
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,640
<font color="yellow">It's Eul.</font>

467
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,200

488
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,600
<font color="yellow">It's illegal to operate an unlicensed street stall.</font>

622
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,230
<font color="yellow">You can't take all this in a taxi.</font>

623
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,590
<font color="yellow">Is this all there is? Shall I take it to the car?</font>

624
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,670
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

625
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,160
<font color="yellow">Stay right here until you hear a clap.</font>

626
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,990
<font color="yellow">I'll unload everything, okay?</font>

627
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,950
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

628
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,550
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

629
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,390
<font color="yellow">You never listen, do you?</font>

630
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,560
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the sauna across the road.</font>

631
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,870
<font color="yellow">Call me when you're done.</font>

632
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,030
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

633
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,470
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

634
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,480
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here. Say hello.</font>

635
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,270
<font color="yellow">Watch him eat your food.</font>

636
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,790
<font color="yellow">I said it's fine. I want to go home.</font>

637
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,060
<font color="yellow">Are you ashamed to see him?</font>

638
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,700
<font color="yellow">Are you embarrassed to see your son?</font>

639
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,060
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

640
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,180
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

641
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,900
<font color="yellow">Young Ok.</font>

642
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,970
<font color="yellow">Stop it, will you?</font>

643
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,950
<font color="yellow">You deserve a beating.</font>

644
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:08,520
<font color="yellow">- Go on inside.
-  I don't want to.</font>

645
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,930
<font color="yellow">Let's just go.</font>

646
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,020
<font color="yellow">- I told you already.
-  Shin Young Ok.</font>

647
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
<font color="yellow">Is it you?</font>

648
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,140
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

649
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,740
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

650
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

651
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,740
<font color="yellow">Jik.</font>

652
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,740
<font color="yellow">There are some scary people out there.</font>

653
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,660
<font color="yellow">Someone might hurt you.</font>

654
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,740
<font color="yellow">You're the scariest-looking person here.</font>

655
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,780
<font color="yellow">Who would hurt me? I'm not a kid.</font>

656
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,260
<font color="yellow">Well, you know...</font>

657
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,260
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying someone will,</font>

658
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,080
<font color="yellow">but I'm scared someone might try to hit you with a car.</font>

659
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,320
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Shouldn't you be at work?</font>

660
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,660
<font color="yellow">I will go back after I walk you home.</font>

661
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,280
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

662
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,460
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

663
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,420
<font color="yellow">Who's the weirdo?</font>

664
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,380
<font color="yellow">What weirdo? Me?</font>

665
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,380
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here?
-  To see you.</font>

666
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,780
<font color="yellow">Why did you ignore me? Can't you text me back?</font>

667
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,940
<font color="yellow">Do you have to ignore me this much?</font>

668
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
<font color="yellow">I thought you hurt your fingers or something.</font>

669
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,980
<font color="yellow">We aren't close enough to text each other.</font>

670
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,500
<font color="yellow">Are you putting up a wall?</font>

671
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,500
<font color="yellow">I thought we'd gotten quite close.</font>

672
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,340
<font color="yellow">- No?
-  Not at all.</font>

673
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,500
<font color="yellow">- Dream on.
-  Who are you, lady?</font>

674
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you holding my Jik's hand?</font>

675
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

676
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,140
<font color="yellow">We're close enough to hold hands.</font>

677
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,620
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  And we're close enough to do this.</font>

678
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

679
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,480
<font color="yellow">I can even...</font>

680
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,340
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  do this.</font>

681
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,700
<font color="yellow">So tell me, who are you?</font>

682
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
<font color="yellow">Why are you...</font>

683
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,860
<font color="yellow">I like him, okay?</font>

684
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,020
<font color="yellow">No! No. No.</font>

685
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,380
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

686
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,220
<font color="yellow">Cut. Okay.</font>

687
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,660
<font color="yellow">Well done, everyone. You did great.</font>

688
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,440
<font color="yellow">Let's pack up.</font>

689
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,780
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  Thank you.</font>

690
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

691
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,460
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

692
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,220
<font color="yellow">You don't have to overdo it like this.</font>

693
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

694
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,020
<font color="yellow">Aren't we dating?</font>

695
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,860
<font color="yellow">Don't try too hard.</font>

696
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,460
<font color="yellow">You can work for people other than Seo Yoon Hoo.</font>

697
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,140
<font color="yellow">This should be illegal.</font>

698
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,420
<font color="yellow">An engaged woman shouldn't be this pretty.</font>

699
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,100
<font color="yellow">You're still charming.</font>

700
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,960
<font color="yellow">Thanks so much for agreeing to be in the movie.</font>

701
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,380
<font color="yellow">It's a great script.</font>

702
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,220
<font color="yellow">I felt bad it was put aside due to the lack of funding.</font>

703
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,260
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

704
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,420
<font color="yellow">aren't you being...</font>

705
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,860
<font color="yellow">too good of a fiancee?</font>

706
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,220
<font color="yellow">Can't I be?</font>

707
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,580
<font color="yellow">Who's the other actor?</font>

708
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,260
<font color="yellow">It's not easy playing a psychopath.</font>

709
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,560
<font color="yellow">Kim Soo Chan. He'll join the team tomorrow.</font>

710
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,620
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

711
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,100
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

712
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,440
<font color="yellow">He's not as big of a star as Joon Young,</font>

713
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,020
<font color="yellow">but his acting's on par.</font>

714
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,100
<font color="yellow">I heard he's a decent guy, too.</font>

715
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,660
<font color="yellow">Joon Young's such a jerk that...</font>

716
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,980
<font color="yellow">Is someone badmouthing me?</font>

717
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

718
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,060
<font color="yellow">To shoot a movie. With you.</font>

719
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,420
<font color="yellow">I'm the psychopath.</font>

720
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,820
<font color="yellow">You turned it down.</font>

721
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not that irresponsible.</font>

722
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,500
<font color="yellow">I finish up what I started.</font>

723
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,220
<font color="yellow">I might be a jerk,</font>

724
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,340
<font color="yellow">but I'm not as bad as you.</font>

725
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,180
<font color="yellow">- You little...
-  Yoon Hoo.</font>

726
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,260
<font color="yellow">Answer your phone.</font>

727
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,620
<font color="yellow">Yoon Hoo speaking.</font>

728
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,820
<font color="yellow">Hi, Hye Jin. I'm in Namhae for a shoot.</font>

729
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,260
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  What's wrong?</font>

730
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,540
<font color="yellow">Is she in your hotel room?</font>

731
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,020
<font color="yellow">I have to go. I'll call you.</font>

732
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,380
<font color="yellow">There are reporters everywhere. Watch out.</font>

733
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,100
<font color="yellow">I apologise for the intrusion. Bye.</font>

734
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,940
<font color="yellow">We met before.</font>

735
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,740
