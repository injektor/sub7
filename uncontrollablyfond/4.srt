<font color="yellow">Why do I feel so bad for her, though?</font>

63
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:29,100

you're a big fake, too.</font>

79

81
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,900

is nothing compared to now!</font>

in a huge house like this?</font>

83
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,199

87
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,400

as the barking of a crazy dog.</font>

you to get this opportunity!</font>

when I have so much damn money?</font>

143
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,500
<font color="yellow">Sure, you must be real happy
because you're so damn rich.</font>

144
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,300
<font color="yellow">I don't even have money to get by</font>

145
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,800
<font color="yellow">and yet you have enough money to
look down on people so damn much</font>

146
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,699
<font color="yellow">and just break promises
like they mean nothing!</font>

147
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,800
<font color="yellow">You must be real happy, you bastard!</font>

148
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,500
<font color="yellow">Pororo!</font>

149
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,800
<font color="yellow">What's going on?
Hey, did you do this to her?</font>

150
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,500
<font color="yellow">Pororo charged at her
because she was bothering me.</font>

151
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
<font color="yellow">- Did Pororo bite her?
- No. He only charged at her.</font>

152
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,400
<font color="yellow">But she ended up passing out.</font>

153
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,500
<font color="yellow">He only charged at her,
and yet she fainted?</font>

154
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
<font color="yellow">It's obviously just an act she thinks
I'm dumb enough to fall for.</font>

155
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,099
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go work out, so pretend
like you fell for it and send her away.</font>

156
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,699
<font color="yellow">Uh, I don't think she's faking it.</font>

157
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,099
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Young! There's definitely
something wrong with her!</font>

158
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,900
<font color="yellow">Hurry over here!</font>

159
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,800
<font color="yellow">I don't think she's faking it.</font>

160
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:15,300
<font color="yellow">Call Dr. Kang.</font>

161
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,000
<font color="yellow">Her blood vessels have expanded
due to the sudden shock</font>

162
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,699
<font color="yellow">and then her blood pressure decreased,
which has led to hypotension.</font>

163
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:31,099
<font color="yellow">You said that she said, "I can't breathe"
before passing out, correct?</font>

164
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,099
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

165
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,699
<font color="yellow">Seeing as she has rashes and
she had difficulty breathing</font>

166
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,699
<font color="yellow">I think that she has a
severe dog allergy.</font>

167
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:41,900
<font color="yellow">A dog... allergy?</font>

168
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,000
<font color="yellow">I've given her a medicine</font>

169
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,699
<font color="yellow">that will raise her blood pressure and
make the inflammation go down</font>

170
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,000
<font color="yellow">so she should be fine after today.</font>

171
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,500
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming on your day off.</font>

172
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,000
<font color="yellow">If you're thankful, give me
an autograph for my daughter.</font>

173
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,599
<font color="yellow">You're looking well.</font>

174
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,000
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes. I know.</font>

175
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,099
<font color="yellow">I think you may have
misdiagnosed me, after all.</font>

176
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:11,900
<font color="yellow">I'll refrain from suing you for
malpractice since you helped me out.</font>

177
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,900
<font color="yellow">Stay here today, okay?
She got sick because of you.</font>

178
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,699
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm really thankful
that you were worried about me</font>

179
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,000
<font color="yellow">but don't do that from now on.</font>

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,099
<font color="yellow">If you'd bitten Eul,
I would've kicked you out, punk!</font>

181
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,300
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

182
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,399
<font color="yellow"><i>[Hubby]</i></font>

183
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
<font color="yellow"><i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable at this time.</i></font>

184
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,300
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

185
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're here?</font>

186
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,200
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't this place be great
for you and Eul to live in?</font>

187
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,300
<font color="yellow">We're living here?</font>

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
<font color="yellow">We don't have the money
to rent this kind of place.</font>

189
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,599
<font color="yellow">A friend of mine emigrated but didn't
want to sell this place or rent it out</font>

190
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,399
<font color="yellow">so all you two need to do is to take
good care of this place and live here.</font>

191
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,800
<font color="yellow">- For free?
- Yeah, for free!</font>

192
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
<font color="yellow">Isn't it great?</font>

193
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,300
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't want to.
- Why... not?</font>

194
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,800
<font color="yellow">Nowadays, my sister is thinking things
like, "who can I backstab for money?"</font>

195
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,099
<font color="yellow">"How can I spend as little money
as I can, and mooch off others?"</font>

196
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:14,495
<font color="yellow">"How can I turn one thousand won
into one million won?"</font>

197
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:18,500
<font color="yellow">She's always thinking about
ridiculous things like this</font>

198
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,599
<font color="yellow">so just imagine what would happen
if she got a place like this for free.</font>

199
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,300
<font color="yellow">She'll say, "See? Life is all about luck.
You don't need to live righteously."</font>

200
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,800
<font color="yellow">And then she'll be ruined as she'll
always be waiting for more luck.</font>

201
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,300
<font color="yellow">I'm really thankful that you're worrying
about us, but I don't like handouts.</font>

202
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,599
<font color="yellow">I was going to stay with a
friend for the time being</font>

203
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,599
<font color="yellow">and my sister can stay
with her friend Na Ri.</font>

204
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,300
<font color="yellow">I'm working part-time,
and my sister works too</font>

205
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,300
<font color="yellow">so I'm sure we'll be able
to find a place to live soon.</font>

206
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,800
<font color="yellow">Fine. Sorry for asking!</font>

207
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,599
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, I can't fathom
what goes on in your head!</font>

208
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,500
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep making me
feel bad like this?</font>

209
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,099
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

210
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,700
<font color="yellow">The mother of the kid I tutor gave it to
me because I raised their grades.</font>

211
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,000
<font color="yellow">Take this and go buy yourself a nice
jacket at the department store.</font>

212
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,599
<font color="yellow">Hey, my jacket is still fine!
Buy a jacket for yourself!</font>

213
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,868
<font color="yellow">Oh, why... is there a hole there?
It was totally fine before.</font>

214
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,700
<font color="yellow">You know that my sister
is really materialistic, right?</font>

215
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
<font color="yellow">I'd love it if you became
my brother-in-law...</font>

216
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,300
<font color="yellow">but my sister doesn't
think of you like that.</font>

217
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
<font color="yellow">Because you're poor, just like us.</font>

218
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,399
<font color="yellow">And my sister only likes rich guys.</font>

219
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,800
<font color="yellow">So, buy yourself some
new clothes with this</font>

220
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,700
<font color="yellow">and knock my sister off her feet!</font>

221
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,899
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,899
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes?</font>

223
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:54,099
<font color="yellow">I won't be there too late.</font>

224
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,899
<font color="yellow">Whoa, Jung Eun made all this?</font>

225
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:40,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, Madame! I thought she
was only pretty and smart</font>

226
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,500
<font color="yellow">but she's quite talented, too!</font>

227
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
<font color="yellow">It's nothing much.</font>

228
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are skilled!</font>

229
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,500
<font color="yellow">Your mother really did raise you well!</font>

230
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,700
<font color="yellow">How did you make all this
in such a short time?</font>

231
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,399
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru, doesn't this make you
feel a certain type of way?</font>

232
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,700
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it does.</font>

233
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,899
<font color="yellow">It makes me feel like she's
a damn show-off!</font>

234
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,300
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru!</font>

235
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, how could you say that--</font>

236
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Jung Eun.</font>

237
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,599
<font color="yellow">It's okay. My friends say
the same thing to me, too.</font>

238
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
<font color="yellow">There's definitely
something off about her.</font>

239
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,500
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

240
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,000
<font color="yellow">There's no way that a person
is that perfect.</font>

241
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,300
<font color="yellow">Her family is crazy rich, she's great at
studying, her face is ridiculously pretty</font>

242
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,200
<font color="yellow">her body is ridiculously sexy, and
her personality is ridiculously great.</font>

243
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,899
<font color="yellow">And she's even ridiculously
great at cooking, to boot!</font>

244
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,000
<font color="yellow">Who, Jung Eun?</font>

245
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,599
<font color="yellow">She definitely can't be a mere earthling.</font>

246
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,200
<font color="yellow">Maybe... she's
"an asshole from another star?"</font>

247
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,700
<font color="yellow">What if, when she goes home,
she eats snakes, rats, and roaches</font>

248
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,099
<font color="yellow">and then goes to a cemetery
when it's midnight, and digs there</font>

249
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,700
<font color="yellow">and opens up the coffins of dead
people and sucks their blood---</font>

250
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,500
<font color="yellow">- Oh, Ji Tae.
- I'm home, Father.</font>

251
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,099
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- What the hell!</font>

252
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,599
<font color="yellow">You surprised me!</font>

253
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,899
<font color="yellow">So why are you talking crap
about other people, then?</font>

254
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,700
<font color="yellow">- Jung Eun is here.
- Yes, I heard.</font>

255
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,500
<font color="yellow">It looks like she came early
and prepared all the food</font>

256
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,700
<font color="yellow">that we'll be offering to your
grandpa for the ancestral rites.</font>

257
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,899
<font color="yellow">Go and tell her
that she did a great job.</font>

258
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will, after I wash up.</font>

259
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,099
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, there may be
something off about her!</font>

260
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,599
<font color="yellow">She could look completely normal
but be a psychopath or a sociopath!</font>

261
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,000
<font color="yellow">Choi Ha Ru!</font>

262
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,700
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding, Dad!
It's a joke!</font>

263
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,399
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, what are you
getting so serious for?</font>

264
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,700
<font color="yellow">You're making your precious
daughter all flustered.</font>

265
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
<font color="yellow">- Sheesh.
- Daddy!</font>

266
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,300
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't like Jung Eun.</i></font>

267
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,099
<font color="yellow">Please cancel this engagement that you
adults planned without even asking us.</font>

268
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,000
<font color="yellow">Jung Eun is a good girl.</font>

269
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
<font color="yellow">All the affluent households
want her as their daughter-in-law!</font>

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,899
<font color="yellow">How could I marry someone
I don't love, or even like?</font>

271
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,099
<font color="yellow">You two only got married
because you loved each other so much.</font>

272
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,700
<font color="yellow">So why are you...</font>

273
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,599
<font color="yellow">Is there another girl
that you're dating?</font>

274
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,300
<font color="yellow">No. That's not it, but...</font>

275
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,200
<font color="yellow">I know what kind of person
Jung Eun's father is to you.</font>

276
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,500
<font color="yellow">I know that you definitely need
his help to fulfill your dream, too.</font>

277
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,800
<font color="yellow">But... even so, marriage is a
lifetime commitment.</font>

278
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,899
<font color="yellow">My entire life depends on it.</font>

279
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:26,000
<font color="yellow">I understand. I'll call them tomorrow
and cancel your engagement.</font>

280
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,800
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

281
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:36,200
<font color="yellow">Fulfilling my dream is important,
but my son is more important to me.</font>

282
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,700
<font color="yellow">I will never use you for the
sake of fulfilling my own dream.</font>

283
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,800
<font color="yellow">This wine's aroma is excellent.
You chose it, didn't you, my son?</font>

284
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,899
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ji Tae.</font>

285
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,099
<font color="yellow">You worked quite hard, didn't you?
You did a great job.</font>

286
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,899
<font color="yellow">If you really think so, give me a kiss.</font>

287
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,200
<font color="yellow">You're a warm person,
but you have no passion.</font>

288
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,399
<font color="yellow">You're only being nice to
me out of a sense of duty</font>

289
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,599
<font color="yellow">because our parents told us to, right?</font>

290
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,700
<font color="yellow">You don't even love me.</font>

291
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,099
<font color="yellow">Wait, what I just said is true, huh?</font>

292
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:22,700
<font color="yellow">Ouch. My pride hurts.</font>

293
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

294
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,599
<font color="yellow">Let's skip the engagement party
and just get married, Yoon Jung Eun.</font>

295
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,300
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

296
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
<font color="yellow">love me?</font>

297
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,399
<font color="yellow">As long as you don't push me away,
I'll never leave you.</font>

298
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,200
<font color="yellow">So you won't say that you love me,
until the very end.</font>

299
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:48,800
<font color="yellow">That's fine, though. I'll just love you
more to compensate for that.</font>

300
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,300
<font color="yellow">I got up, and I was really hungry.</font>

301
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back for the ramen.</font>

302
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,099
<font color="yellow">No... I'll give you money
for the ramen, punk.</font>

303
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,300
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're even
working together anymore</font>

304
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,599
<font color="yellow">so I can speak
informally to you, right?</font>

305
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,200
<font color="yellow">Is fainting your trademark,
or something?</font>

306
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,200
<font color="yellow">It's because I have
a weak immune system.</font>

307
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,099
<font color="yellow">I got into a car accident a while ago
and got three surgeries</font>

308
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,000
<font color="yellow">so my body is on its last legs now.</font>

309
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,899
<font color="yellow">Do you, by any chance...</font>

310
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,700
<font color="yellow">have any cold rice?</font>

311
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:29,300
<font color="yellow">Um, about... what you said before.</font>

312
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,099
<font color="yellow">Is that offer still valid?</font>

313
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,899
<font color="yellow">Um, so... um...</font>

314
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,000
<font color="yellow">You said that you could give me
a car, a house, and a building.</font>

315
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,800
<font color="yellow">You said that you could give me
anything that I wanted.</font>

316
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,500
<font color="yellow">I know you won't give me any
of that, but I asked just in case.</font>

317
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,899
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want?</font>

318
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,599
<font color="yellow">Can I really tell you?</font>

319
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,099
<font color="yellow">100 million won.</font>

320
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,000
<font color="yellow">To me, that's the hugest
amount of money I can think of.</font>

321
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,800
<font color="yellow">But... that's too much money, right?</font>

322
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
<font color="yellow">50 million won, then.</font>

323
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,700
<font color="yellow">30 million won?</font>

324
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,300
<font color="yellow">10 million won!</font>

325
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,200
<font color="yellow">If you just give me that, I'll never
bother you about the documentary again.</font>

326
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,099
<font color="yellow">I won't ever appear before
you again, either.</font>

327
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,200
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to just give it
to me, lend it to me.</font>

328
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,300
<font color="yellow">With 82 months of no interest.</font>

329
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,700
<font color="yellow">60 months of no interest?</font>

330
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,800
<font color="yellow">You can't even lend it to me?
Even though you're so rich?</font>

331
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
<font color="yellow">No, I can't.</font>

332
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,399
<font color="yellow">Then why did you even ask me
to tell you what I wanted?</font>

333
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,000
<font color="yellow">Wow, I heard that rich people are
even stingier, and they were right.</font>

334
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,300
<font color="yellow">Earn that money by working! You
still have functioning limbs, don't you?</font>

335
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,099
<font color="yellow">So why are you trying to get
handouts from other people?</font>

336
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,200
<font color="yellow">See, that's only possible when
I actually have work to do!</font>

337
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,500
<font color="yellow">Because of your stupid temper,
I lost the job I worked so hard to get!</font>

338
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,399
<font color="yellow">Let's do the documentary, then.</font>

339
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,399
<font color="yellow">- There you go again.
- Let's shoot it.</font>

340
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,899
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, Your Highness.</font>

341
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,800
<font color="yellow"><i>What? What's going on?</i></font>

342
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,700
<font color="yellow">Re-write my contract for
the documentary, please.</font>

343
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
<font color="yellow"><i>You said that you
weren't doing it, though.</i></font>

344
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Gook Young called me and told me
that you said you weren't doing it.</i></font>

345
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,300
<font color="yellow">I changed my mind.
I'll do it this time.</font>

346
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:59,359
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay. You might change your mind
again, so call me back in the morning--</i></font>

347
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,899
<font color="yellow">I won't. You can include
in the contract that</font>

348
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:04,700
<font color="yellow">I'll pay 1000 times the original
severance fee if I change my mind again!</font>

349
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you really going to do it?</i></font>

350
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,399
<font color="yellow"><i>[From: No Eul
Gift Coupon]</i></font>

351
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,599
<font color="yellow"><i>- Mister!</i>
- What's this?</font>

352
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,700
<font color="yellow"><i>A present from me,
since I just got a job!</i></font>

353
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,300
<font color="yellow">Jik and I mooched off you so much
when you don't even have money!</font>

354
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,300
<font color="yellow">So much so, that you couldn't
even buy a proper pair of sneakers.</font>

355
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,899
<font color="yellow">So, you got a job?</font>

356
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:52,000
<font color="yellow">I thought that you became infamous,
so nobody would take you as a PD!</font>

357
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
<font color="yellow">Good job, Eul!</font>

358
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,200
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be shooting
Shin Joon Young's documentary.</font>

359
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,399
<font color="yellow">Isn't that amazing?
Isn't this unbelievable?</font>

360
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,700
<font color="yellow">People don't realize this,
but I'm quite skilled!</font>

361
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,899
<font color="yellow">I'm going to destroy everyone
who looked down on me!</font>

362
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,200
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

363
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,899
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you saying anything, Mister?</font>

364
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you fall asleep?</i></font>

365
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,300
<font color="yellow">Oh no, it's already
past three in the morning!</font>

366
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,099
<font color="yellow">Are you really asleep, Mister?</font>

367
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,099
<font color="yellow">Well, good night, then!</font>

368
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,500
<font color="yellow">Are you mad?</font>

369
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not kicking you out forever.</font>

370
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,300
<font color="yellow">Just consider this a nice trip to a
vacation home with fresh air</font>

371
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,700
<font color="yellow">and stay here for like three months.
Just until I finish the documentary.</font>

372
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,700
<font color="yellow">Look, you get to see clouds,
and the sky!</font>

373
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,300
<font color="yellow">And I'm sure you'll be able to see
the stars and the moon at night!</font>

374
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,000
<font color="yellow">This is a great spot!</font>

375
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,200
<font color="yellow">Then, do you want me to live here
and let you live inside?</font>

376
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,399
<font color="yellow">- Ma'am!
- Yes?</font>

377
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,800
<font color="yellow">Um, can you make sure to clean all of
Pororo's fur off the carpets and floors?</font>

378
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

379
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,899
<font color="yellow">Um, there's someone who's
allergic to Pororo's fur...</font>

380
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,200
<font color="yellow">Forget it.
I'll take care of it myself.</font>

381
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,300
<font color="yellow">Ta-da! I got the taro milk tea that you
like so much, with tons of ice!</font>

382
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,600
<font color="yellow">I also got tapioca pearls,
and coconut, too!</font>

383
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,800
<font color="yellow">And this is the jumbo size,
with tons of milk foam!</font>

384
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,100
<font color="yellow">Well? How is it?</font>

385
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,300
<font color="yellow">Also, this milk foam is to represent
how I feel about you!</font>

386
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,700
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this to me?</font>

387
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,600
<font color="yellow">Wow, PD No,
your skin got so much better!</font>

388
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,300
<font color="yellow">See? People need to take
breaks between jobs!</font>

389
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,999
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing
you listened to me, huh?</font>

390
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,200
<font color="yellow">- What are you--
- Shush!</font>

391
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,300
<font color="yellow">Well, then, you've gotten plenty of rest</font>

392
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
<font color="yellow">so how about coming back
to work now, Eul?</font>

393
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
<font color="yellow">What work?</font>

394
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,399
<font color="yellow">The Ministry of Culture and Tourism
asked us to shoot a documentary.</font>

395
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:46,999
<font color="yellow">And I'd like it if you could
do that for us, PD No.</font>

396
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,800
<font color="yellow">- Oh, I get it.
- What?</font>

397
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,517
<font color="yellow">I guess you've already
heard the rumors, huh?</font>

398
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,100
<font color="yellow">That I'm doing
Shin Joon Young's documentary?</font>

399
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,999
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?
I didn't hear about that.</font>

400
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:03,999
<font color="yellow">So how could you fire a skilled person
like me without recognizing my talent?</font>

401
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:07,700
<font color="yellow">I guess you really have no talent
for judging people's character.</font>

402
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,300
<font color="yellow">I'll double your pay, and pay you
more than those people are!</font>

403
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,899
<font color="yellow">I'll hire you as a full-time employee,
and give you company insurance!</font>

404
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,499
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Really!</font>

405
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:24,800
<font color="yellow">Oh, just a second. Sorry.
I have to take this call.</font>

406
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,700
<font color="yellow">Whoa.</font>

407
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,999
<font color="yellow">Yes, Section Chief.
Oh, um...</font>

408
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,800
<font color="yellow">PD No is here at my office right now.</font>

409
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,399
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll take responsibility for her
and persuade her, no matter what.</i></font>

410
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,100
<font color="yellow"><i>So, don't worry too much, sir.</i></font>

411
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,499
<font color="yellow">Thank you.
If you do convince her</font>

412
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:50,800
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the investment rights
that we were talking about.</font>

413
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,800
<font color="yellow">Why are there flowers
at Joon Young's place?</font>

414
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
<font color="yellow">He even changed his
cushions and carpets, too!</font>

415
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, this punk.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

416
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,399
<font color="yellow">Isn't this great?</font>

417
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,899
<font color="yellow">And he was putting up such a fuss,
saying he wouldn't do the documentary!</font>

418
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:25,700
<font color="yellow">Well, you know how much he
secretly loves being on shows!</font>

419
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:29,399
<font color="yellow">But, where is Joon Young?</font>

420
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, are you in the bathroom?</font>

421
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,200
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Are you pooping?</font>

422
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,999
<font color="yellow">All right, take care of
your business, then!</font>

423
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,700
<font color="yellow"><i>"Why now?"
I wanted to ask.</i></font>

424
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Why now, when I've been fine?</i></font>

425
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,399
<font color="yellow"><i>Why now, when I've been
eating well and sleeping well?</i></font>

426
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,200
<font color="yellow"><i>Why now, when I just beat
by three minutes</i></font>

427
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,999
<font color="yellow"><i>my record for climbing
Cheonggye Mountain?</i></font>

428
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:34,700
<font color="yellow"><i>And No Eul is supposed
to come today, too.</i></font>

429
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:38,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I've been waiting for this
moment for so long.</i></font>

430
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
<font color="yellow"><i>So why now?</i></font>

431
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,800
<font color="yellow"><i>At that moment, I remembered the
promise I made a long time ago.</i></font>

432
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,899
<font color="yellow"><i>"Please, just save Eul."</i></font>

433
00:38:53,899 --> 00:39:02,300
<font color="yellow"><i>"If you do, I'll give up
all of the happiness</i></font>

434
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,499
<font color="yellow"><i>that I was supposed to
experience in my lifetime."</i></font>

435
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:13,999
<font color="yellow"><i>"I'll give up all of my happiness."</i></font>

436
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:24,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you. After all, you called me
back here and treated me so well.</font>

437
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,300
<font color="yellow">No, I'm the one who's more
thankful. I was worried</font>

438
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,100
<font color="yellow">that you wouldn't want to work because
you were still hung up over last time.</font>

439
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,499
<font color="yellow">But as to be expected,
you're as passionate as ever!</font>

440
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:34,999
<font color="yellow">You're not hung up over
the past, either!</font>

441
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,999
<font color="yellow">That's not true.
I'm totally hung up over it.</font>

442
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:38,999
<font color="yellow">Wait, what?</font>

443
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to work at this company.</font>

444
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,499
<font color="yellow">Wait, what are you talking about?
You totally love money!</font>

445
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,399
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'll pay you double!</font>

446
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:51,200
<font color="yellow">And make you full-time, on top of that!
And you'll even get health insurance!</font>

447
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, No Eul!</font>

448
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:07,999
<font color="yellow">All of those benefits
do sound really awesome, but...</font>

449
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:14,100
<font color="yellow">if I betray Shin Joon Young,
he'll definitely kill me. Like, for sure.</font>

450
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,700
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry. No Eul usually goes crazy
for money, but she said no--</i></font>

451
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,999
<font color="yellow"><i>If a demon like you
becomes an assemblyman</i></font>

452
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,999
<font color="yellow"><i>there really will be
no hope for this country.</i></font>

453
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:43,999
<font color="yellow">If you reveal the true criminal behind
my father's case that you covered up...</font>

454
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:47,100
<font color="yellow">I'll burn all the materials
that I have about you.</font>

455
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,300
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

456
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:37,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, give me back my bag!
Stop right there! Hey!</font>

457
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,100
<font color="yellow">Look into the owner
of this phone for me.</font>

458
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,800
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

459
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,700
<font color="yellow">Someone who almost killed
his own girlfriend...</font>

460
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,200
<font color="yellow">to save my father.</font>

461
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:29,600
<font color="yellow"><i>About the guy you asked me
to look into...</i></font>

462
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
<font color="yellow"><i>His name is Shin Joon Young.</i></font>

463
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,100
<font color="yellow"><i>And I think that he's your father's son.</i></font>

464
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,399
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Doctor.</font>

465
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,399
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're not
a quack after all.</font>

466
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:49,999
<font color="yellow">The disease is progressing a lot
more quickly than I'd expected.</font>

467
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:53,999
<font color="yellow">How long do I have left to live, then?</font>

468
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,499
<font color="yellow">Six months?</font>

469
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
<font color="yellow">Three months?</font>

470
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,899
<font color="yellow">How about checking into the hospital
and getting treatment now?</font>

471
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,499
<font color="yellow">We can give you chemotherapy
and radiation therapy.</font>

472
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:05,899
<font color="yellow">- We'll do all we can--
- But...</font>

473
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:08,800
<font color="yellow">Even if we do all that,
I'll end up dying anyway.</font>

474
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,600
<font color="yellow">But still, we can lengthen the
amount of time you'll have left.</font>

475
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:16,600
<font color="yellow">I don't need that.</font>

476
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,200
<font color="yellow">Just write me a prescription for
really powerful pain meds, please.</font>

477
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,499
<font color="yellow">Get me some pain meds that will ensure
that nobody finds out about my illness.</font>

478
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,100
<font color="yellow">Ones that make me forget about
the fact that I'm ill, too.</font>

479
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,242
<font color="yellow">If you make it so that I won't
be in pain until I die</font>

480
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:38,300
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 100 autographs.</font>

481
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,800
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Shin Joon Young?</font>

482
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,499
<font color="yellow">Yes, it seems like it.</font>

483
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:59,100
<font color="yellow">I wonder why he's at the hospital?</font>

484
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,800
<font color="yellow">We'll have to hurry, ma'am.
You're late for your appointment.</font>

485
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

490

<font color="yellow">Why would you be in a meeting
when you run a restaurant?</font>

491
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:41,100
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're going

496
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,399

"kind of" or "a little bit!"</font>

497
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:09,499
<font color="yellow">It'll just make you seem
unconfident and petty!</font>

498
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:11,810
<font color="yellow">Say "he's definitely fading out!"
Got it?</font>

499
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,499
<font color="yellow">You need to sound like
you're full of confidence</font>

500
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,100
<font color="yellow">for people to be like,
"ah, that must be true!"</font>

505
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,300
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

506
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,600
<font color="yellow">To be honest, there aren't too
many people who look like him.</font>

507
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,499
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go outside and see for
yourself whether or not that's true?</font>

508
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:36,499
<font color="yellow">Come on, Yong Deuk!</font>

509
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:37,899
<font color="yellow">If you say something that's
so obviously untrue</font>

510

"like" on your comment, either!</font>

00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:45,499
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

513
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:50,899
<font color="yellow"><i>Shin Joon Young should just retire.</i></font>

514

every time he's on TV.</i></font>

515
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:58,999
<font color="yellow">I do tend to change the channel
whenever Joon Young is on TV...</font>

516
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:01,800
<font color="yellow">from a channel he isn't on

520
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:19,100
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take a photo and report
you for online harassment.</font>

521

<font color="yellow">Hey, Yong Deuk!</font>

522
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,999
<font color="yellow">I told you to peel garlic
because I'm making pickles, didn't I?</font>

523
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:30,800
<font color="yellow">But this is all you've managed
to peel in two hours!</font>

524
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,700
<font color="yellow">Instead, you were busy writing hateful
comments about Joon Young, weren't you?</font>

525
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,300
<font color="yellow">You know our boss. She
prioritizes that over peeling garlic.</font>

526
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,999
<font color="yellow">I have to listen to the boss.
I'm a mere worker, after all.</font>

527
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

528
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,999
<font color="yellow">And you, Man Ok!</font>

529
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,600
<font color="yellow">You're Shin Joon Young's
wardrobe assistant.</font>

530
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,800
<font color="yellow">And yet, you're his anti-fan?</font>

531
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,499
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

532
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:56,399
<font color="yellow">Honestly, don't you remember how happy
Boss was when Joon got into law school?</font>

533
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:58,800
<font color="yellow">But he didn't even talk things over with
any of us, and dropped out!</font>

534
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,899
<font color="yellow">No proper human being should
do such a terrible thing!</font>

535
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,200
<font color="yellow">He's not even a proper human being.</font>

536
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,800
<font color="yellow">Joon Young is just more
with the times, is all!</font>

537
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,999
<font color="yellow">Geez, you kids are so old-fashioned!</font>

538
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:13,100
<font color="yellow">You people really don't know
what's trendy nowadays!</font>

539
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,999
<font color="yellow">That's enough.
Stop it, already.</font>

540
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:17,700
<font color="yellow">You're the worst of them all!</font>

541
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,700
<font color="yellow">Who cares about Choi Hyun Joon?</font>

542
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,399
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'd really care that
you made Joon Young into a prosecutor?</font>

543
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,899
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'd say, "Oh, great job,
Ok!" if you managed to do that</font>

544
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:29,999
<font color="yellow">and cast his own family aside
to live with you instead--</font>

545
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Young didn't become a celebrity
because he wanted to be one!</font>

546
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,300
<font color="yellow">Your stupid son got himself in trouble,
and Joo Young needed to help him out</font>

547
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,600
<font color="yellow">which is why he took the signing bonus</font>

548
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,300
<font color="yellow">and ended up like this, because he's
trying to pay that money back now!</font>

549
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,399
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know about that?</font>

550
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,899
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

551
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,999
<font color="yellow">How did she know about that?</font>

552
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:57,800
<font color="yellow">Wait, how has she not
killed my family yet, knowing that?</font>

553
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:14,600
<font color="yellow">Joon Young knows that you write mean
comments on articles relevant to him.</font>

554
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,700
<font color="yellow">He's not suing anyone who
writes mean comments about him</font>

555
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,200
<font color="yellow">because he's scared that it may be you.</font>

556
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,600
<font color="yellow">Crazy bastard.</font>

557
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,700
<font color="yellow">These are the materials that
the Resources Team collected</font>

558
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,700
<font color="yellow">to catch internet slanderers.</font>

559
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,600
<font color="yellow">And this is a petition signed
by over 1 million people</font>

560
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,899
<font color="yellow">saying that they want the
slanderers to be punished.</font>

561
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:43,100
<font color="yellow">These are documents revealing the
identities of some of these people.</font>

562
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,999
<font color="yellow">This person definitely deserves
to rot in jail forever!</font>

563
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:49,300
<font color="yellow">I know this person, too.</font>

564
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,800
<font color="yellow">What does it matter if they keep
changing their ID and IP address?</font>

565
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,800
<font color="yellow">All they do is keep copying and
pasting the same stupid comment!</font>

566
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,499
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

567
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:03,999
<font color="yellow">The PD working on Joon Young's
documentary... is a woman?</font>

568
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,100
<font color="yellow">And to top it all off,
she looks... weird...</font>

569
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,300
<font color="yellow">So this hussy is going to stick
around our Joon Young, 24/7?</font>

570
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,200
<font color="yellow">Is this woman actually a PD?</font>

571
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,499
<font color="yellow">She looks really young,
and she looks totally unskilled!</font>

572
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:27,499
<font color="yellow">It seems like there's some
foul play involved, right?</font>

573
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:28,499
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Yes!</font>

574
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:31,399
<font color="yellow">I think that we should focus on getting
this woman before that slanderer.</font>

575
00:51:31,399 --> 00:51:32,800
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

576
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,700
<font color="yellow">Her name is... No Eul?</font>

577
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, her name is No Eul?</font>

578
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,300
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I sent this woman's
photo to the group chat</font>

579
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,499
<font color="yellow">so try and dig up some intel about her.</font>

580
00:51:46,499 --> 00:51:47,499
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

581
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:50,200
<font color="yellow">Find out if she's actually a PD,
and where she went to school.</font>

582
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,300
<font color="yellow">And where she lives!
Oh, and about her family.</font>

583
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,300
<font color="yellow">Anything about her past would be great,
so find out as much as you can.</font>

584
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,899
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to do
some searching, too.</font>

585
00:51:57,899 --> 00:51:59,399
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

586
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:00,499
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

587
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:05,300
<font color="yellow">When you said "No Eul," were you
talking about the female PD?</font>

588
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,100
<font color="yellow">- One who shoots documentaries.
- Yes, so?</font>

589
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,100
<font color="yellow">Do you know her, by any chance?</font>

590
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, well, a bit.</font>

591
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,899
<font color="yellow">You're telling me that you
really know this woman?</font>

592
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:15,300
<font color="yellow">What kind of relationship
do you two have?</font>

593
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,899
<font color="yellow">Are you... her boyfriend,
by any chance?</font>

594
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:22,200
<font color="yellow">I'm working right now,
so I can't chat for very long.</font>

595
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,899
<font color="yellow">But if you give me your phone number,
I'll call you when I leave work.</font>

596
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:28,700
<font color="yellow">You're not... lying, are you?</font>

597
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,800
<font color="yellow">If you can't believe me,
never mind, then.</font>

598
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:44,300
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare think of voice
phishing me, or selling my number!</font>

599
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,499
<font color="yellow">My dad used to be a really famous
prosecutor, back in the day!</font>

600
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,200
<font color="yellow">What should I save your name as?
What's your name?</font>

601
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,499
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

602
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:56,800
<font color="yellow">I mean, Oh Jik.
What about you?</font>

603
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,100
<font color="yellow">Choi Ha Ru.</font>

604
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,300
<font color="yellow">But, um, your name is
Oh Jik (means "only")?</font>

605
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:12,800
<font color="yellow">This project is to try and overcome
our nation's shameful title</font>

606
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,300
<font color="yellow">as the country with the highest suicide
rate among the OECD countries</font>

607
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,999
<font color="yellow">for ten years straight, and is a
part of a suicide prevention campaign</font>

608
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:24,100
<font color="yellow">that the Ministry of Education and the
Ministry of Health and Welfare are doing.</font>

609
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,300
<font color="yellow">In order to do that, we've chosen 10
people who are influential among teens</font>

610
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,300
<font color="yellow">and are revealing those
10 individuals' bucket lists</font>

611
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,800
<font color="yellow">to teach teens how
to live life to the fullest.</font>

612
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,499
<font color="yellow">Our aim is also to show them that
setting concrete goals for their lives</font>

613
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:37,300
<font color="yellow">and living honestly will help them feel
enjoyment and purpose in their lives.</font>

614
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,499
<font color="yellow">And thus, they will come to
treasure their lives more--</font>

615
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:40,300
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

616
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,999
<font color="yellow">Turn the lights back on.</font>

617
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:53,800
<font color="yellow">I really don't get what you're saying,
so can you put it in simpler terms?</font>

618
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,499
<font color="yellow">Simpler terms?
But this is as simple as it gets.</font>

619
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:00,200
<font color="yellow">I'm kind of an idiot, you see.</font>

620
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:05,700
<font color="yellow">It's quite simple.</font>

621
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:11,399
<font color="yellow">It's to tell teens who want to give up on
life because it's hard, to not give up.</font>

622
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:12,899
<font color="yellow">And to tell them to live,
no matter what.</font>

623
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:14,499
<font color="yellow">Or to tell them to not die,
no matter what.</font>

624
00:54:14,499 --> 00:54:18,700
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is convey that sort
of message through your bucket list.</font>

625
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,100
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- Wow!</font>

626
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,800
<font color="yellow">To tell people that life is worth living,
no matter what price you must pay</font>

627
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,600
<font color="yellow">and that life is a beautiful thing</font>

628
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,100
<font color="yellow">and that it's like a blessing from God,
so one mustn't lose hope and be brave--</font>

629
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,700
<font color="yellow">You didn't tell me that would
be the concept for this, CEO.</font>

630
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,200
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I sent all
the materials to you via Chief Jang.</font>

631
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,700
<font color="yellow">I left them on your desk!</font>

632
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:54,499
<font color="yellow">So that... you would read them.
You didn't read them?</font>

633
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:20,999
<font color="yellow">Hey, he's not going to say he's not
doing the documentary again, right?</font>

634
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:22,399
<font color="yellow">If he does, I'm done for.</font>

635
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:26,700
<font color="yellow">If that happens, Ms. Face-in-a-dish...
I mean, PD No Eul...</font>

636
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,800
<font color="yellow">is going to pull out a knife and
go on a murder-suicide rampage!</font>

637
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,999
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

638
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,399
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

639
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,823
<font color="yellow">Who wants to bet that Shin Joon Young
is going to change his mind again? I am.</font>

640
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,300
<font color="yellow">- Me too.
- Me three!</font>

641
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, hurry up and pack everything!</font>

642
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,499
<font color="yellow">This project is over!</font>

643
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:49,600
<font color="yellow">I'll try to convince him.</font>

644
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,600
<font color="yellow">Let's start the filming.</font>

645
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,899
<font color="yellow">Mr. Shin Joon Young. What's
the first item on your bucket list?</font>

646
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:28,200
<font color="yellow">All right.
Let's say that you'll die in a year.</font>

647
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,700
<font color="yellow">What's the first thing you'd want to do?</font>

648
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,800
<font color="yellow">Would you want to go somewhere,
or do something special?</font>

649
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,200
<font color="yellow">Or would you want
to see a certain someone?</font>

650
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything like that?</font>

651
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,300
<font color="yellow">You'll die in a year.
You only have a year left.</font>

652
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,999
<font color="yellow">Isn't there anything you'd
want to do, or see--</font>

653
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:56,300
<font color="yellow">A year is too long.</font>

654
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,399
<font color="yellow">Let's say that I only had
three months left to live.</font>

655
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:04,899
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's say that you
only had three months, then.</font>

656
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:05,899
<font color="yellow">I'd live recklessly.</font>

657
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:07,899
<font color="yellow">I'd take care of the bastards
who look down on me</font>

658
00:57:07,899 --> 00:57:11,100
<font color="yellow">and kill everyone that
I don't like very much.</font>

659
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,600
<font color="yellow">That doesn't go with the
theme of our documentary.</font>

660
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,899
<font color="yellow">It's to show people through
these bucket lists</font>

661
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:20,300
<font color="yellow">that life is a precious
and beautiful thing--</font>

662
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,899
<font color="yellow">- I'd go to clubs and seduce women.
- Excuse me.</font>

663
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:24,499
<font color="yellow">And I'd sleep with a different
woman every night.</font>

664
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:28,399
<font color="yellow">Stop! Stop, stop, stop!
Let's stop the interview.</font>

665
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:30,600
<font color="yellow">Don't stop it.
Let's keep going.</font>

666
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:36,999
<font color="yellow">Does this production seem like
a joke to you, Mr. Shin Joon Young?</font>

667
00:57:38,399 --> 00:57:43,800
<font color="yellow">I'm not joking.
I'm being honest.</font>

668
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,602
<font color="yellow">I could do anything if
I were going to die soon.</font>

669
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:49,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to try drugs,
too, while you're at it?</font>

670
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,999
<font color="yellow">What about drunk driving, peeing
on the streets, and gambling--</font>

671
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:55,700
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go
out with me, PD No Eul?</font>

672
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:02,499
<font color="yellow">Let's pretend that I'll
really die in three months...</font>

673
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:11,600
<font color="yellow">and have a really passionate
romance for those three months.</font>
