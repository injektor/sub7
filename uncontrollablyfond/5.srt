4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,920
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's say
that you were going to die in a year.</font>

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,210
<font color="yellow">You're going to die in a year.
You only have one year left.</font>

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,120
<font color="yellow">Isn't there anything
you'd want to do, or see...</font>

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,710
<font color="yellow">A year is too long.</font>

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,520
<font color="yellow">Let's say that I only have
three months left to live.</font>

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,100
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's say that you
only have three months, then.</font>

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,020
<font color="yellow">I'd live recklessly. I'd take care of
the bastards who look down on me</font>

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,410
<font color="yellow">and kill everyone I don't like.</font>

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,310
<font color="yellow">That doesn't go with
the theme of our documentary.</font>

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,020
<font color="yellow">It's to show people through
their bucket lists</font>

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,020
<font color="yellow">that life is a precious
and beautiful thing...</font>

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,520
<font color="yellow">- I'd go to clubs and seduce women.
- Excuse me.</font>

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,120
<font color="yellow">And I'd sleep with
a different woman every night.</font>

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,310
<font color="yellow">Stop! Stop, stop, stop!
Let's stop the interview.</font>

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,520
<font color="yellow">Don't stop.
Let's keep going.</font>

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,420
<font color="yellow">Does this production seem like
a joke to you, Mr. Shin Joon Young?</font>

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,310
<font color="yellow">I'm not joking.
I'm being honest.</font>

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,420
<font color="yellow">I could do anything I wanted
if I were going to die soon.</font>

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,810
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to try drugs
while you're at it?</font>

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,360
<font color="yellow">What about drunk driving, peeing
in the street, and gambling...</font>

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,720
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go
out with me, PD No Eul?</font>

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,310
<font color="yellow">Let's pretend that I really will
really die in three months...</font>

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,920
<font color="yellow">and have a really passionate
romance for those three months.</font>

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,110
<font color="yellow">Let's have a dangerously fiery
romance, for just three months.</font>

28
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,520
<font color="yellow">Well, today was just a test shoot</font>

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,610
<font color="yellow">so I guess our Joon Young is joking
around to loosen up for the real deal...</font>

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,710
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm not joking.</font>

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,610
<font color="yellow">I clearly said that I wasn't joking.</font>

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
<font color="yellow">You don't want to, Ms. PD?</font>

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,320
<font color="yellow">Of course I'd want to! Heck, I'm really
grateful that you asked me out!</font>

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,920
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young, a top star,
just asked me out.</font>

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,320
<font color="yellow">I'd be a crazy fool
to refuse that kind of offer!</font>

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
<font color="yellow">- PD No!
- PD No!</font>

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,920
<font color="yellow">When should we start?
Are we going to start today?</font>

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,110
<font color="yellow">If we start dating, it'll be
officially announced, right?</font>

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,210
<font color="yellow">That'd be fine with me, too.</font>

41
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, I can announce that I'm dating
you on my social media pages, right?</font>

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,710
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

43
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,710
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

44
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,110
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I guess she caused
some sort of trouble again.</font>

45
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,520
<font color="yellow">She's been like this
for about 30 minutes now.</font>

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,820
<font color="yellow">You really want to end
your life in such a pathetic way?</font>

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,610
<font color="yellow">Did you cause trouble again?</font>

48
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,610
<font color="yellow">I think I'll probably
get fired, Mister.</font>

49
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,110
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

50
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,420
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to get fired from
working on Shin Joon Young's documentary.</font>

51
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,520
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,020
<font color="yellow">Well... because I took what he said
as a joke for the documentary seriously.</font>

53
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,520
<font color="yellow">No... because I treated
what he said seriously as a joke...</font>

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,020
<font color="yellow">Wait, no.</font>

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,820
<font color="yellow">Because I treated seriously what
he said, when he was being serious.</font>

56
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,710
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

57
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,320
<font color="yellow">She sounds like
she's finally lost it.</font>

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,210
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't!</font>

59
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,910
<font color="yellow">Why do you only ever say
things like that about me?</font>

60
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,910
<font color="yellow">Because you look down
on me so damn much</font>

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,710
<font color="yellow">everyone else in the world
does the same!</font>

62
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,820
<font color="yellow">All right? Even though none of you
can say a thing to Shin Joon Young!</font>

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,910
<font color="yellow">Nobody says anything to him
when he's saying crazy nonsense</font>

64
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,820
<font color="yellow">so why is everyone only
calling me the crazy one?</font>

65
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,210
<font color="yellow">Do I seem like I'm that
easy to take advantage of?</font>

66
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,820
<font color="yellow">- You little... hey!
- Ow!</font>

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,320
<font color="yellow">When was I never able
to talk back to Shin Joon Young?</font>

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,120
<font color="yellow">Why the hell are you
unloading all this on me?</font>

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,910
<font color="yellow">Do I seem like I'm that
easy to take advantage of?</font>

70
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,020
<font color="yellow">Exactly. I really
must be crazy.</font>

71
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,210
<font color="yellow">It's for the best.</font>

72
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,910
<font color="yellow">Forget about shooting
a celebrity documentary</font>

73
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,320
<font color="yellow">and go back to doing investigative TV.
It's what you do best.</font>

74
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,820
<font color="yellow">I'll help you find a job.</font>

75
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,120
<font color="yellow">You're unemployed too, though!
You're in no position to be helping me.</font>

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll get a job soon, punk!</font>

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,710
<font color="yellow">When you get a job, should I
go and get a job from you?</font>

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,320
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired of dealing
with other people.</font>

79
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,910
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't let me or Jik starve
at the very least, Mister.</font>

81
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,710
<font color="yellow">So... couldn't you hire me
for the position of your wife?</font>

82
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,520
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

83
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,210
<font color="yellow">Another PD will come to replace Ms. Face-
in-a-dish-of-water starting tomorrow!</font>

84
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,320
<font color="yellow">I know that you asked her out on
camera today as a plot to get her fired.</font>

85
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,210
<font color="yellow">Our CEO is really pissed off right now
and said, "What kind of crazy PD is she?"</font>

86
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,710
<font color="yellow">And that he couldn't entrust
you to a psycho like her!</font>

87
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,910
<font color="yellow">So he went and told that
to the production staff.</font>

88
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,710
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now, Mr. Joon Young?</font>

89
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,910
<font color="yellow">What was she supposed to say
in that situation, anyway?</font>

90
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,120
<font color="yellow">"Oh my gosh, you roach-like
piece of crap!"</font>

91
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,910
<font color="yellow">"Are you out of your damn mind?"</font>

92
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,520
<font color="yellow">And then say, "You and I will both die
here today!" and fight you, like that?</font>

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,910
<font color="yellow">If she did, she would've
been yelled at</font>

94
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,910
<font color="yellow">for daring to talk back to a top
celebrity when she's a mere PD!</font>

95
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,820
<font color="yellow">Just think about it!</font>

96
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,710
<font color="yellow">It's really not right for
the production staff to be doing this.</font>

97
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,320
<font color="yellow">I mean, even if she's just a freelance
worker, how could they just say</font>

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,210
<font color="yellow">that they were thinking
of getting a new PD?</font>

99
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:24,120
<font color="yellow">Seriously, how can people be so cruel?
I mean, even if she has no power, how...</font>

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,020
<font color="yellow">That was the last bit
of my spiel. Sorry, I'll shut up.</font>

101
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,910
<font color="yellow">Call the CEO.</font>

102
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,520
<font color="yellow">And tell him that I won't shoot
a single scene of the documentary</font>

103
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
<font color="yellow">if PD No Eul isn't working on it.</font>

104
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,020
<font color="yellow">Tell him to re-hire PD No Eul
if he doesn't want to find</font>

105
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,320
<font color="yellow">a new celebrity to be
his company's main cash cow.</font>

106
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,910
<font color="yellow">Mister. Here's a snack
to go with that.</font>

107
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,910
<font color="yellow">All right! I take back my proposal!</font>

108
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,410
<font color="yellow">I take it back, damn it!</font>

109
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,520
<font color="yellow">Why won't you just be honest and say
that you don't want me as your wife?</font>

110
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,120
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking so much
soju on an empty stomach</font>

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,710
<font color="yellow">when you have such
a low tolerance?</font>

112
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,320
<font color="yellow">"Oh, come on, Eul! Why would I turn
down such a lovely woman like you?"</font>

113
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,320
<font color="yellow">"I like you so much, and it's just that
I don't know how to react to all this"</font>

114
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,210
<font color="yellow">"because I can't believe
that it's happening."</font>

115
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
<font color="yellow">So you won't say
that either, huh?</font>

116
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,810
<font color="yellow">Wow. So you won't say anything at all?</font>

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,520
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

118
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,020
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I don't like you
that much either, you know!</font>

119
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,720
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's not even coming
out here to stop me.</font>

120
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,910
<font color="yellow">He has high standards for someone
who has nothing to his name.</font>

121
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,310
<font color="yellow">Damn it, how embarrassing!</font>

122
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,720
<font color="yellow">Both my job and my proposal
ended in disaster.</font>

123
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,020
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

124
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,310
<font color="yellow">It's just because I'm stuck in a pit of
bad luck right now. That's what it is.</font>

125
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,720
<font color="yellow">Sheesh, Eul really
needs to learn her place.</font>

126
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,020
<font color="yellow">How dare she flirt with someone
like you, of all people?</font>

127
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:14,020
<font color="yellow">In your opinion, do I seem
like I'm better than Eul?</font>

128
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,720
<font color="yellow">Of course! I mean,
you're still unemployed</font>

129
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,910
<font color="yellow">but you're way
better off than she is!</font>

130
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,810
<font color="yellow">All she has is a mountain of debt
and a terrible temper!</font>

131
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,620
<font color="yellow">And she keeps accepting
bribes all the time.</font>

132
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,720
<font color="yellow">So I was thinking, I know
a woman who cooks well</font>

133
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,220
<font color="yellow">and has some money saved up,
and is a decent looker...</font>

134
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,020
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

135
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,910
<font color="yellow">don't deserve to have her.</font>

136
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,120
<font color="yellow">I don't deserve Eul...</font>

137
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,020
<font color="yellow">which is why I can't accept her.</font>

138
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,310
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,910
<font color="yellow">Oh no, she left her phone.</font>

140
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,410
<font color="yellow">That klutz!</font>

141
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,410
<font color="yellow">That guy definitely
isn't normal, either.</font>

142
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,910
<font color="yellow">Eul!

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,810
<font color="yellow">Is that jerk Shin Joon Young
that great? Huh?</font>

285
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,220
<font color="yellow">Yeah, he is.</font>

286
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,920
<font color="yellow">And honestly, she doesn't even seem
like that much of a weirdo to me.</font>

287
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,020
<font color="yellow">She's totally normal!</font>

288
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,720
<font color="yellow">But he's great enough to make a normal
girl like her become as deranged as this!</font>

289
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,110
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm talking about.</font>

290
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,520
<font color="yellow">Don't fall for Joon Young, Big Sis.</font>

291
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

292
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you'll start liking him</font>

293
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,020
<font color="yellow">after you spend a lot of time with him,
while you're shooting that documentary.</font>

294
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,520
<font color="yellow">- But don't even dream about it.
- You punk.</font>

295
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

296
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,310
<font color="yellow">He lives in a completely different
world than you do now, Big Sis.</font>

297
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,920
<font color="yellow">Don't misunderstand something
he says carelessly, and fall for him.</font>

298
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,420
<font color="yellow">If you do, you'll end up being
the only one who gets hurt.</font>

299
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,310
<font color="yellow">Did you have a nice
breakfast, sweetie?</font>

300
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,020
<font color="yellow">Yeah, the braised beef short ribs
did taste a bit weird, right?</font>

301
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,110
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you
not to eat that, punk!</font>

302
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,310
<font color="yellow">I'd like it if things between you
and Hyun Woo went well.</font>

303
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,220
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have much,
but he's a really good person.</font>

304
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,610
<font color="yellow">And he definitely suits you.</font>

305
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,110
<font color="yellow">Being with him will make you happy.</font>

306
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,110
<font color="yellow">All right, that's
all the nagging for today!</font>

307
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,420
<font color="yellow">Work hard, Eul!</font>

308
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,110
<font color="yellow">Good luck with the documentary!</font>

309
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,920
<font color="yellow">That punk is supposed
to be my little brother?</font>

310
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,520
<font color="yellow">I was already rejected
by Mr. Hyun Woo, all right?</font>

311
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,310
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even know
what he's talking about.</font>

312
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,220
<font color="yellow">Damn it, how embarrassing!</font>

313
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,110
<font color="yellow">When you get a job, should I
go and get a job from you?</font>

314
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,310
<font color="yellow">I'm so sick of other people.</font>

315
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,310
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

316
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:17,220
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't let me or Jik starve
at the very least, Mister.</font>

317
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,310
<font color="yellow">So... couldn't you hire me
for the position of your wife?</font>

318
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,610
<font color="yellow">- Am I "Nampyeon"?
- Um...</font>

319
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,610
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

320
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,110
<font color="yellow">Whenever I get into a spat with
someone, you always take their side.</font>

321
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,920
<font color="yellow">"Nam" meaning "other people", and "pyeon"
meaning "side". So you're "Nampyeon".</font>

322
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,720
<font color="yellow">Come on, Ji Tae.</font>

323
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,400
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

324
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
<font color="yellow">Ji Tae, your father
wants to see you.</font>

325
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,610
<font color="yellow">- Father?
- Yeah.</font>

326
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,520
<font color="yellow">Seeing as how you're taking
your time to think about this</font>

327
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,400
<font color="yellow">it seems that your brilliant move
might turn out to be a terrible one.</font>

328
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,220
<font color="yellow">That's what you want, isn't it?</font>

329
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,220
<font color="yellow">But such a thing won't happen.</font>

330
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,220
<font color="yellow">Let's see, here.</font>

331
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,310
<font color="yellow">I just have to hit both of them, right?</font>

332
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,110
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

333
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,420
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, let's play one more time.</font>

334
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,500
<font color="yellow">That's not fair!
Come on, give it to me.</font>

335
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,020
<font color="yellow">The ball that Greg Norman signed.</font>

336
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know what I
had to go through to get that?</font>

337
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,220
<font color="yellow">I'll give you anything else but that.
Come on, one more round!</font>

338
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,810
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- Wow, Father!</font>

339
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,520
<font color="yellow">You're really going to be like this?
I'm going to tell Mom about this!</font>

340
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,520
<font color="yellow">Wow, you really want to win
that badly, huh?</font>

341
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,110
<font color="yellow">Wow! Totally ridiculous!</font>

342
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,610
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn
that phrase, Father?</font>

343
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,520
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on. Let's
play one more round!</font>

344
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
<font color="yellow">- All right, go ahead!
- No!</font>

345
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,720
<font color="yellow">Daddy!</font>

346
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,020
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello, Choi Ha Ru!</font>

347
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,220
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm totally drained.</font>

348
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,420
<font color="yellow">Where did you head off to
so early in the morning?</font>

349
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,920
<font color="yellow">Our Joon Young's concert is today.</font>

350
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,610
<font color="yellow">Here. Put this on,
and come to his concert.</font>

351
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,810
<font color="yellow">It's at the Olympic Hall, at 6 p.m.</font>

352
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,610
<font color="yellow">How could I go there?</font>

353
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,920
<font color="yellow">Come on! The leader
of the Korean Nationalist Party</font>

354
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,810
<font color="yellow">went to an EXO concert
with his daughter!</font>

355
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,920
<font color="yellow">He even posted a photo of
himself there, and put it online.</font>

356
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,720
<font color="yellow">His popularity skyrocketed!
You didn't know about that?</font>

357
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

358
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,110
<font color="yellow">Father's busy.</font>

359
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,420
<font color="yellow">Also, shouldn't you be studying?</font>

360
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,020
<font color="yellow">Are you going to re-take the college
entrance exams for the third time</font>

361
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,220
<font color="yellow">because you're too busy following
Shin Joon Young around?</font>

362
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,520
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Come on, Dad!
Come with me!</font>

363
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,520
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. I heard that he's
also shooting a documentary.</font>

364
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,220
<font color="yellow">You'll be really popular if
you're seen at the concert, Dad!</font>

365
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,720
<font color="yellow">Choi Ha Ru!
I told you to stop it.</font>

366
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,150
<font color="yellow">Do you think that you can
just ignore what I say?</font>

367
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,520
<font color="yellow">Big... Brother.</font>

368
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,310
<font color="yellow">The other people preparing for exams
don't want to waste even a second</font>

369
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,220
<font color="yellow">and aren't even
sleeping that much.</font>

370
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,920
<font color="yellow">So how is it that you have the time
to go see some damn concert?</font>

371
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,420
<font color="yellow">Stop the Shin Joon Young
fan club nonsense!</font>

372
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,020
<font color="yellow">No! Joon Young is more
important to me than college!</font>

373
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,920
<font color="yellow">My life has no meaning
without Joon Young!</font>

374
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,460
<font color="yellow">Why the hell are you butting into
something that's none of your business?</font>

375
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,720
<font color="yellow">That's no way to speak
to your older brother!</font>

376
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,920
<font color="yellow">Choi Ha Ru! How could
you say that to him?</font>

377
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,520
<font color="yellow">He's acting so weird!</font>

378
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,720
<font color="yellow">He's being so scary
all of the sudden.</font>

379
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,110
<font color="yellow">He must've gone crazy, Dad!</font>

380
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for acting that
way in front of you, Father.</font>

381
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
<font color="yellow">I suddenly find myself liking
this Shin Joon Young guy.</font>

382
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,720
<font color="yellow">Why is it that you never
get angry, Ji Tae?</font>

383
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
<font color="yellow">There are tons of things
that probably make you angry</font>

384
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,220
<font color="yellow">so why is it that you never get mad?
Do you have some kind of mental issue?</font>

385
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,020
<font color="yellow">I even wondered for a while
if I should take you to a hospital.</font>

386
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,110
<font color="yellow">But it seems that I don't have to.</font>

387
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,110
<font color="yellow">You know how to get angry,
and how to lose your temper.</font>

388
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,110
<font color="yellow">I've finally realized that my
son is fine, thanks to this man</font>

389
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,020
<font color="yellow">so shouldn't I buy the guy
a meal, at the very least?</font>

390
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:43,040
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd

391
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,720
<font color="yellow">You changed the passcode
on the door? That's not nice.</font>

392
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,720
<font color="yellow">I thought you said
that you'd call me back.</font>

393
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,110
<font color="yellow">"I'm in a meeting, so I can't pick up.
I'll call you back right away."</font>

394
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,010
<font color="yellow">You ignored my call,
and sent me that text.</font>

395
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,720
<font color="yellow">The meeting's not over yet.
What are you going to do about it?</font>

396
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,920
<font color="yellow">I'm having a concert today.</font>

397
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,310
<font color="yellow">These are the best seats in the house,
so come with Uncle Jung Shik.</font>

398
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,520
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance to get a glimpse
of your sexy son from the best spot.</font>

399
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,310
<font color="yellow">This is your last chance.</font>

400
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,110
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to see me being
so cool again, even if you want to.</font>

401
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,920
<font color="yellow">Wow, what a great thing to hear.</font>

402
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks for giving me such great
news, first thing in the morning!</font>

403
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,520
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

404
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,020
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Let go!</font>

405
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,920
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling "Mom"? Since
when have you treated me like your mom?</font>

406
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
<font color="yellow">You dropped out of that
school of your own volition</font>

407
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,610
<font color="yellow">even though you worked
so hard to get in</font>

408
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,920
<font color="yellow">and you became a celebrity without
even talking to me about it!</font>

409
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with being a celebrity?</font>

410
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,520
<font color="yellow">It's much better to be
a celebrity than a prosecutor.</font>

411
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,220
<font color="yellow">You don't know just how
rich I am, do you?</font>

412
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,720
<font color="yellow">I own buildings, a house, and
three expensive cars, and...</font>

413
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, really, now? Must
be nice to be so damn rich.</font>

414
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,520
<font color="yellow">You said that you'd
become a prosecutor</font>

415
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,920
<font color="yellow">and protect people like us who are
poor and have no connections</font>

416
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,420
<font color="yellow">and you acted so high and mighty
about it all, saying you'd do it!</font>

417
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,810
<font color="yellow">Aren't you ashamed of yourself?</font>

418
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,420
<font color="yellow">A guy like me shouldn't
be a prosecutor, Mom.</font>

419
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,520
<font color="yellow">If a guy like me were
to become a prosecutor</font>

420
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,020
<font color="yellow">people like you who are weak,
poor, and have no connections</font>

421
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,920
<font color="yellow">couldn't live in this country.
You'd have to emigrate.</font>

422
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,220
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

423
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,310
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I'll leave those seats
open for you and Uncle.</font>

424
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,110
<font color="yellow">Come over if you
change your mind.</font>

425
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,720
<font color="yellow">I'm not going.</font>

426
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,420
<font color="yellow">Wait until you die.
I still won't go.</font>

427
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,420
<font color="yellow">Wow, my mom sure
knows how to be harsh.</font>

428
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,970
<font color="yellow">I almost cried.</font>

429
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,420
<font color="yellow"><i>[INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONCERT]</i></font>

430
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:29,460
<font color="yellow">Welcome to the concert. If you have
your tickets, please come to the front.</font>

431
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,820
<font color="yellow">Stop crying, already!
It's not like your parents died!</font>

432
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,710
<font color="yellow">I'm really hurt! How could
my brother do that to me?</font>

433
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,820
<font color="yellow">How could he yell at his
one and only little sister...</font>

434
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,110
<font color="yellow">and glare at me like that,
as if he wanted to kill me?</font>

435
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,610
<font color="yellow">I take after Mom, so I have
a really weak heart, too.</font>

436
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,710
<font color="yellow">Your mother has a problem
with her kidneys, not her heart.</font>

437
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,610
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing!</font>

438
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,520
<font color="yellow">My older brother must
really be out of his mind.</font>

439
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,110
<font color="yellow">Way to go, way to go.</font>

440
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,520
<font color="yellow">Look at you, dissing your older brother
who's just looking out for you.</font>

441
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,210
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- Assemblyman!</font>

442
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,110
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that family members
who care about you would yell at you</font>

443
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,520
<font color="yellow">about chasing celebrities
when you should be studying</font>

444
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,020
<font color="yellow">for the college entrance exams!</font>

445
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,320
<font color="yellow">So stop talking crap about your
older brother already, Choi Ha Ru!</font>

446
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,710
<font color="yellow">How did you get here?</font>

447
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,820
<font color="yellow">I sent him a text saying that Ha Ru
was really hurt and she keeps crying.</font>

448
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,520
<font color="yellow">And that I feel like the concert hall
will flood because of her tears!</font>

449
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,920
<font color="yellow">Did you come because you
were worried about Ha Ru?</font>

450
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,820
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

451
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,110
<font color="yellow">Keep this a secret from your
mom and older brother, okay?</font>

452
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,520
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

453
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not raising my child
very well, am I?</font>

454
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,110
<font color="yellow">Just between you and me, Ha Ru doesn't
exactly have a talent for studying.</font>

455
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,600
<font color="yellow">It's not like her grades will go up just
because she sits hunched over a desk.</font>

456
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,020
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

457
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,110
<font color="yellow">And it's not like I'm
a huge troublemaker</font>

458
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,920
<font color="yellow">since I'm too busy chasing
Joon Young around.</font>

459
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,610
<font color="yellow">Sure, sure. Good job, my daughter.</font>

460
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,820
<font color="yellow">Um, Assembly... um, I mean,
Ha Ru's father.</font>

461
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,820
<font color="yellow">Since you came all the way here, why
don't the three of us take a photo?</font>

462
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,520
<font color="yellow">Wait, um, no.
That's okay.</font>

463
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,110
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll take it now!</font>

464
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,110
<font color="yellow">One, two, three!</font>

465
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,020
<font color="yellow">- Forever Shin Joon Young!
- Forever Shin Joon Young!</font>

466
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,210
<font color="yellow">- We love you, Shin Joon Young!

00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,020

Prosecutor's Office, right?</font>

492
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,420
<font color="yellow">I want to grow up and
be a prosecutor, too.</font>

493

be working with in the future, after all.</font>

496
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,020
<font color="yellow">So I should autograph this for you.</font>

497
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,320
<font color="yellow">Next time.</font>

498
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,820
<font color="yellow">I'll study hard, and come back with
my bar exam results saying that I passed</font>

500
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,110
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you my name then.</font>

501
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,210
<font color="yellow">Mr. Shin Joon Young.</font>

502
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,420
<font color="yellow">It looks like you won't be coming
back to the Prosecutor's Office.</font>

503
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,110
<font color="yellow">Where did the Assemblyman go?</font>

504
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,320
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young's concert?</font>

505
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,320
<font color="yellow">Why... did he go there?</font>

506
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,020
<font color="yellow"><i>It seems that he went
because of Ms. Ha Ru.</i></font>

507
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

508
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,920
<font color="yellow"><i>You've been on my mind all day.</i></font>

509
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,520
<font color="yellow">I told you to peel the onions.
What the hell are you doing?</font>

510
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,820
<font color="yellow">I was watching his concert so I could
think of more evil comments to write.</font>

511
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

512
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,710
<font color="yellow">But to be honest, there's not a lot
of bad things I can say about him.</font>

513
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,020
<font color="yellow">He's really cool to me too,
and I'm a guy!</font>

514
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
<font color="yellow">Go inside and peel some onions!</font>

515
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,210
<font color="yellow">- And peel the garlic, too!
- Damn it!</font>

516
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,920
<font color="yellow">What did you say?
How dare you!</font>

517
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,520
<font color="yellow">Did you just curse at me?
That little bastard!</font>

518
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,870
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking your
frustrations out on Yong Deuk?</font>

519
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,820
<font color="yellow">Where have you been all day,
that you just got back now...</font>

520
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,920
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

521
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,270
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

522
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,610
<font color="yellow">- The money Gook Young owes Joon Young.
- Jung Shik.</font>

523
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,610
<font color="yellow">I gave that to Gook Young to
give Joon Young three years ago</font>

524
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,610
<font color="yellow">but that bastard went and used it
all, which is why it took so long.</font>

525
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,350
<font color="yellow">Where did you get such
a large sum of money?</font>

526
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,520
<font color="yellow">I got my friend to pay me back
the money he owed me</font>

527
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,920
<font color="yellow">by lying down in front of his house.</font>

528
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,680
<font color="yellow">I also took my house's
safety deposit.</font>

529
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,110
<font color="yellow">As for the interest, you
can take it out of my paycheck.</font>

530
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,820
<font color="yellow">- Jung Shik.
- Sheesh.</font>

531
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,520
<font color="yellow">Wow, it feels so great to get that
five-year-old burden off my chest!</font>

532
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,020
<font color="yellow">I don't owe you anything
anymore, all right?</font>

533
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,520
<font color="yellow">We're equals now, in material
possession, in state of mind...</font>

534
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,110
<font color="yellow">and as a man and woman. Got that?</font>

535
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,920
<font color="yellow">Also, let's make this
one thing clear, all right?</font>

536
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,710
<font color="yellow">Joon Young didn't quit law
school just to help my son, all right?</font>

537
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,920
<font color="yellow">The first thing that happened was
that Joon Young quit law school</font>

538
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,020
<font color="yellow">for some reason unbeknownst to us.</font>

539
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,020
<font color="yellow">My Gook Young
caused trouble after that.</font>

540
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,820
<font color="yellow">And then... the third
thing that happened</font>

541
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,520
<font color="yellow">is that Joon Young
became a celebrity</font>

542
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,110
<font color="yellow">got his signing bonus,
and then helped Gook Young.</font>

543
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,020
<font color="yellow">Got it? The correct order of events?</font>

544
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,920
<font color="yellow">Yep, I'm sure you do.</font>

545
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,820
<font color="yellow">- All right, he's here!
- All right!</font>

546
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,020
<font color="yellow">Wow, the audience's
response to you was great!</font>

547
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,710
<font color="yellow">- Hey, get some water for him.
- Yes, sir!</font>

548
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,520
<font color="yellow">- All right, here you are.
- Okay!</font>

549
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,710
<font color="yellow">You'll sing your last song
after the guest performance</font>

550
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,020
<font color="yellow">so keep your energy up for
just a bit longer, Star Shin!</font>

551
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,520
<font color="yellow">All right!</font>

552
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,420
<font color="yellow">All right!
Let's do this!</font>

553
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,710
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since
your last concert, right?</font>

554
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,710
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

555
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,320
<font color="yellow">Can you share your
thoughts about it with us?</font>

556
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,420
<font color="yellow">Who was that man?</font>

557
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

558
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,210
<font color="yellow">The one who picked up
your phone last night.</font>

559
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,520
<font color="yellow">He was listed as
"Husband" in your phone.</font>

560
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,520
<font color="yellow">Change the subject!</font>

561
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,820
<font color="yellow">Is he your boyfriend?</font>

562
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,020
<font color="yellow">On my way into the concert hall</font>

563
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,820
<font color="yellow">I saw some fans who came from
halfway across the world to see you.</font>

564
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,920
<font color="yellow">- Can you say hello to them...
- He's your boyfriend, right?</font>
