<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

6

because I'm not planning on stopping.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Oh?
- It's quite late.</font>

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,999
<font color="yellow">I'd like to say the same to you.</font>

9
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,600
<font color="yellow">I was listening to my
friend's complaints for a while.</font>

<font color="yellow">Complaints?</font>

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,799
<font color="yellow">My friend...</font>

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,600
<font color="yellow">and my friend's...</font>

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,400
<font color="yellow">younger brother...</font>

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,999
<font color="yellow">liked the same woman.</font>

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
<font color="yellow">Oh no.</font>

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:32,579
<font color="yellow">But my friend's father has a bad
relationship with the woman's family.</font>

17
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:41,200
<font color="yellow">So my friend had no choice
but to give up on the girl...</font>

18
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:49,590
<font color="yellow">but his little brother
took her hand, and ran off.</font>

a drama that Mrs. Jang likes.</font>

21
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,900

today, and you buy drinks?</font>

22
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,399

23
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,200

into the ocean and die.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's just drown.</font>

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,299

being alive, anyway.</font>

26
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,899
<font color="yellow">So let's just drown.</font>

27
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you wouldn't be able to die
with me if I asked you to, though.</font>

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,399
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.
Never mind.</font>

73
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,800
<font color="yellow">Do you even know me?
Why are you prying into my business?</font>

74
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,800
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Are you all right?</font>

75
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,200
<font color="yellow">Oh my, why do I feel so drunk?
I don't even think I drank that much.</font>

76
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
<font color="yellow">Your tolerance has gone down, Father.</font>

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,399
<font color="yellow">That's because your mom
is overprotective of me.</font>

78
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,399
<font color="yellow">- Let's go home.
- Yes.</font>

79
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,000
<font color="yellow">Huh? Where's my phone?
Is it over here?</font>

80
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,099
<font color="yellow">Where did it go?</font>

81
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,399
<font color="yellow">Hey, have you seen my phone?</font>

82
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,700

83

84
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,200
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

85
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:00,999
<font color="yellow">Um... what was my number, again?</font>

86
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,599
<font color="yellow">Um... three, nine.</font>

87
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:10,400
<font color="yellow">No, no, that's Na Ri's number.</font>

88
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
<font color="yellow">Seven, three.</font>

89
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,800
<font color="yellow">Why did he drink so much?
Did you ask him to drink with you?</font>

90
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
<font color="yellow">Yes. I asked him to buy me a drink.</font>

91
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,800
<font color="yellow">You know that he needs to watch his
health, and that he shouldn't drink!</font>

92
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,700
<font color="yellow">He's not even getting
much sleep nowadays</font>

93
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,499
<font color="yellow">because of his work
with the judiciary committee.</font>

94
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,599
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

95
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,800
<font color="yellow">How can you children
be so self-centered?</font>

96
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,211
<font color="yellow">I'll go make some honey water.
Change his clothes for him.</font>

97
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,700
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Mother.
- I'm so mad at you!</font>

98
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,656
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

99
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,800
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

100
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,599
<font color="yellow">Hello? You should say
something since you called me.</font>

101
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,999
<font color="yellow">Do you know...</font>

102
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,590
<font color="yellow">just how hard it was
for me, all this time?</font>

103
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:28,164
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard to pretend
that I didn't like you...</font>

104
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:33,099
<font color="yellow">You don't know how hard
that was, do you?</font>

105
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
<font color="yellow">Why were you so good to me?</font>

106
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,200
<font color="yellow">Why did you always buy me food,
when you didn't even have money?</font>

107
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,599
<font color="yellow">And why did you buy me clothes?</font>

108
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:55,771
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy me clothes, and
worry about whether or not I ate</font>

109
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,300
<font color="yellow">and even take me to the hospital
when I wasn't feeling well?</font>

110
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,999
<font color="yellow">Why did you do
all of those things for me?</font>

111
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,099
<font color="yellow">Even though you were going
to go and reject me twice, like this.</font>

112
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:07,499
<font color="yellow">And both times, it was in front of tons
of people! How humiliating!</font>

113
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:14,900
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me so confused? Why?</font>

114
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,800
<font color="yellow">What's so great about
you anyway, Mister?</font>

115
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,200
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

116
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,900
<font color="yellow">You're older than Shin Joon Young,
and have less money than he does.</font>

117
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,499
<font color="yellow">You don't even have a car, and
yet Shin Joon Young has three!</font>

118
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,800
<font color="yellow">You don't own a house,
or a building!</font>

119
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,999
<font color="yellow">So what right do you
have to reject me?</font>

120
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,400
<font color="yellow">Give me my phone back.</font>

121
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,599
<font color="yellow">Mister... can't you just
think it over one more time?</font>

122
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:03,900
<font color="yellow">You know, I'm not
really that bad of a catch.</font>

123
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,700
<font color="yellow">I'll be really good
to you from now on...</font>

124
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,099
<font color="yellow">so please, say yes, Mister!</font>

125
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:15,599
<font color="yellow">Be my boyfriend!
Please?</font>

126
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,800
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

127
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,400
<font color="yellow">Give me back my phone.</font>

128
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,099
<font color="yellow">This isn't yours.
It's mine!</font>

129
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,999
<font color="yellow">Still! Give it back!
I still have stuff to say to Mister!</font>

130
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,555
<font color="yellow">What else do you have to say?
You've been enough of a nuisance!</font>

131
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,200
<font color="yellow">Give me back my phone!</font>

132
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,400
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

133
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:00,700
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?
Do you want some water?</font>

134
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,099
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

135
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,499
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault.</font>

136
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,400
<font color="yellow">It's because of what you did...</font>

137
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,300
<font color="yellow">that I can't be with Eul.</font>

138
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,400
<font color="yellow">Go get my phone.</font>

139
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,200
<font color="yellow">I told you. It's not your
phone. It's mine.</font>

140
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,384
<font color="yellow">Go get my phone!
I still have stuff to say to Mister!</font>

141
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,800
<font color="yellow">If you have that much to say,
go get it yourself!</font>

142
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,900
<font color="yellow">That damn psycho.</font>

143
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,800
<font color="yellow">- Get out of there!
- Let go!</font>

144
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,599
<font color="yellow">- Get out of there.
- Let go!</font>

145
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,200
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

146
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,400
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

147
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,999
<font color="yellow">Hey!
Hey!</font>

148
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
<font color="yellow">Ow.</font>

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,600
<font color="yellow">I feel like this isn't harsh enough.</font>

296
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,600
<font color="yellow">"Shin Joon Young is a has-been now.
He's on an express train to retirement."</font>

297
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
<font color="yellow">How's that, Ms. Shin?</font>

298
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:53,600
<font color="yellow">- It's pretty good, right?
- Oh, nice, "Pretty Spy"!</font>

299
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,200
<font color="yellow">"Wow. Shin Joon Young, who
was so popular, has totally lost it."</font>

300
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
<font color="yellow">How was that, Boss?</font>

301
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,200
<font color="yellow">- It's pretty good, right?
- Nice, "Deuk Dragon"!</font>

302
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,499
<font color="yellow">"Good", my ass!</font>

303
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,299
<font color="yellow">I've caught you all now!</font>

304
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,799
<font color="yellow">I left you all alone because
we all know each other</font>

305
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,700
<font color="yellow">but do I look like
an idiot to you? Huh?</font>

306
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,100
<font color="yellow">"Pretty Spy" and "Deuk Dragon". Prepare
to have lawsuit paperwork sent to you!</font>

307
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,900
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Shin!
- Boss!</font>

308
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,400
<font color="yellow">They didn't do anything wrong.
I told them to do all of that</font>

309
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,197
<font color="yellow">so if you're going to sue someone
or send someone to jail, send me.</font>

310
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:44,499
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Shin!
- Isn't that a little extreme?</font>

311
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:46,900
<font color="yellow">Your one and only son is embroiled
in this sort of situation</font>

312
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,499
<font color="yellow">the least that you could do
is worry about him!</font>

313
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,600
<font color="yellow">Is that really something
that a parent should be saying?</font>

314
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
<font color="yellow">- Are you really even his mother?
- Please, not you too.</font>

315
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,900
<font color="yellow">No, don't hold me back. I held
back all this time for Joon Young</font>

316
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,292
<font color="yellow">but I can't stand it anymore.
I really need to say my peace today.</font>

317
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,400
<font color="yellow">Say your piece, eh?</font>

318
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,200
<font color="yellow">What the hell do you have to say to me?</font>

319
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,719
<font color="yellow">Wow, are you speaking
informally to me right now?</font>

320
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,478
<font color="yellow">I'm older than you, you know!</font>

321
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,132
<font color="yellow">Don't you see all my white hair?</font>

322
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:11,168
<font color="yellow">Why don't you speak informally
to me too, then, punk?</font>

323
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,168
<font color="yellow">Ms. Shin!</font>

324
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,170
<font color="yellow">You went and took my son,
who was studying so hard</font>

325
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,400
<font color="yellow">and you turned him into
some damn road show!</font>

326
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
<font color="yellow">What could you possibly
have to say to me?</font>

327
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,759
<font color="yellow">Road show?
Road show!</font>

328
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,100
<font color="yellow">How could you call the greatest
Hallyu star a mere "road show"?</font>

329
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,499
<font color="yellow">Other parents treat people
like me as if I saved their life</font>

330
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:26,499
<font color="yellow">if I get their kids to be
as popular as Joon Young!</font>

331
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:27,584
<font color="yellow">They bow down and thank me.</font>

332
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,400
<font color="yellow">Then go and make other
people's kids into stars</font>

333
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
<font color="yellow">and have them kiss your ass
for the rest of your life!</font>

334
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to go
and hang around my Joon Young?</font>

335
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,499
<font color="yellow">Wow, I totally get it now.</font>

336
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:38,900
<font color="yellow">I totally get why Joon Young is such a
mess and does whatever the hell he wants!</font>

337
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,299
<font color="yellow">It'd be weird for him to be normal, when
he was raised by such a psychotic mom!</font>

338
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,900
<font color="yellow">Wow, I feel so bad for Joon Young!</font>

339
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,400
<font color="yellow">What did you just
say, you little shit?</font>

340
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,499
<font color="yellow">"Psychotic?" I'll
show you psychotic!</font>

341
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,200
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

342
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,499
<font color="yellow">- Let him go, Jung Shik.
- Apologize right now!</font>

343
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:02,700
<font color="yellow">Say, "I'm sorry, I couldn't tame my
tongue because I lost my temper."</font>

344
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,799
<font color="yellow">and apologize
to Joon Young's mom right now!</font>

345
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,999
<font color="yellow">Let him go, already!</font>

346
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,200
<font color="yellow">Ok, do you know
what "psychotic" means?</font>

347
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,499
<font color="yellow">It means the same thing as
"crazy bitch". That's what it means.</font>

348
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,200
<font color="yellow">He just called you a crazy bitch,
so how could I do nothing?</font>

349
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,799
<font color="yellow">Just do nothing.
Please, just do nothing!</font>

350
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,400
<font color="yellow">You, leave Joon Young alone.
And you, leave Joon Young alone!</font>

351
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,600
<font color="yellow">And you two, leave him alone!</font>

352
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,799
<font color="yellow">Just back off
for a damn second, all of you!</font>

353
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:35,900
<font color="yellow">No, we can't just do nothing! We have
to find Joon Young before we do that!</font>

354
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,200
<font color="yellow">Gook Young... get me out of this.</font>

355
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,600
<font color="yellow">Father, let go, already!</font>

356
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,799
<font color="yellow">Ms. Shin told you to just sit still!</font>

357
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,900
<font color="yellow">- Ow!
- Why, I ought to...</font>

358
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,299
<font color="yellow">Ow!</font>

359
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:49,299
<font color="yellow">I am being still. How could
I be more still than this?</font>

360
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,600
<font color="yellow">My Ok told me not to lay
a finger on him, so I'm not!</font>

361
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

362
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,499
<font color="yellow">- Come on, Dad.
- What?</font>

363
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,900
<font color="yellow">Where did that punk go?</font>

364
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,999
<font color="yellow">And who the hell is that girl?</font>

365
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:22,600
<font color="yellow">Ok, Choi Hyun Joon went
to his son's concert.</font>

366
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,900
<font color="yellow">Did you find out why
Shin Joon Young was at the hospital?</font>

367
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,499
<font color="yellow">Hallyu has surpassed
our expectations in China.</font>

368
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:54,400
<font color="yellow">There's a lot of demand for Korean
movies, movies, music, and beauty items.</font>

369
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,799
<font color="yellow">I'm quite surprised at the popularity of
Hallyu in China. And I'm so thankful.</font>

370
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,799
<font color="yellow">The most popular Korean celebrity
among Chinese people is...</font>

quite popular in China.</font>

373

<font color="yellow">Oh, my daughter
really likes him, too.</font>

374
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,900
<font color="yellow">That's why I didn't like him
that much, to be honest.</font>

375
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but please
excuse me for a second.</font>

376
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:32,700
<font color="yellow">- Escort these gentleman.
- Yes, sir.</font>

377
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,400
<font color="yellow">Shin Young Ok?</font>

378
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,200
<font color="yellow">Young Ok.</font>

379
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,799
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's been a while.</font>

380
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799

calling me Young Ok.</font>

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,400
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you
for a really long time.</font>

386

<font color="yellow">I can't believe that you didn't
come back once after you were elected.</font>

387
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,299
<font color="yellow">That was quite disappointing.</font>

stalker-fans, and they're out to get you!</font>

shooting Joon Young's documentary...</font>

- What?</font>

398
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:34,499
<font color="yellow">Apparently, you have a secret video,
and you're blackmailing him with it!</font>

00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:37,200
<font color="yellow">Who the hell is saying
that kind of nonsense?</font>

are actually buying this garbage?</font>

401
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,600
<font color="yellow">Yeah, they are. And even if it's
revealed later that it isn't true</font>

402
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,799
<font color="yellow">people will still believe

my face on the newspaper.</font>

where Joon Young is?</font>

409

<font color="yellow">You're with him, right?
And you're just lying to me!</font>

410
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:20,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying!</font>

411
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,399
<font color="yellow">Are you not satisfied with making
me the National Gold Digger</font>

412

Shin Joon Young is</font>

kidnapped me, anyway!</font>

<font color="yellow">Report him for kidnapping, and--</font>

417
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:35,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

418
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

419
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,000
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

420
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,700
<font color="yellow">You kept inviting me to your place. But
you're wussing out, now that I'm here?</font>

421
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,600
<font color="yellow">Not exactly.</font>

422
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,799
<font color="yellow">It's just that someone so ugly
is standing so close to me.</font>

423
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,100
<font color="yellow">So I was a bit taken aback.</font>

424
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,600
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

425
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship
with that woman?</font>

426
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,000
<font color="yellow">What is she to you that you're
so intent on protecting her</font>

427
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,100
<font color="yellow">and you threatened to kill
me if I laid a hand on her?</font>

428
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:20,200
<font color="yellow">That's exactly our relationship.
It is justifiable for me to act that way.</font>

429
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,899
<font color="yellow">So be careful, so that I don't
have to keep nagging you.</font>

430
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:27,600
<font color="yellow">Where is that woman right now?</font>

431
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,799
<font color="yellow">Why? So you can tell other people,
and actually end up killing her?</font>

432
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,899
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that! Whatever.
Just tell me where she is.</font>

433
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:38,200
<font color="yellow">I don't know, either.</font>

434
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,500
<font color="yellow">Joon Young has been off our radar
ever since he disappeared with that girl.</font>

435

<font color="yellow">I've been on social media all day,
but nobody has seen him!</font>

00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,700
<font color="yellow">I heard that woman goes crazy for
money, so what if she sold him off--</font>

437
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,200

a famous prosecutor, right?</font>

you're going to throw up again?</font>

took his car and left by now.</font>

be caught by others.</font>

461
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:37,600

leave Shin Joon Young?</font>

462
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,299

with another man?</font>

none of that is true!</font>

- Yeah?</font>

the tripe is burning!</font>

466
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Those little suckers
will just take care of themselves.</font>

467
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,661
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

468
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,399
<font color="yellow">That was a joke!
It was funny, right?</font>

469
00:39:55,399 --> 00:40:00,200
<font color="yellow">You didn't know that I was
a funny woman too, did you?</font>

470
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,000

before you go, Ms. Star!</font>

471
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:10,500

to wear sunglasses indoors?</font>

<font color="yellow">You're so clumsy as it is...</font>

473
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,399
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is a nuisance.</font>

474
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,399
<font color="yellow">You're jealous, right?</font>

475
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:42,000
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't run away, you
could've become a star, like me.</font>

476
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,799
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

477
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:47,799
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm not as blessed.</font>

478
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,799
<font color="yellow">You're a coward.</font>

479
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

480
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,700
<font color="yellow">You're despicable.</font>

481
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

482
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,399
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

483
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,600
<font color="yellow">If you let go of my hand and left,
you shouldn't have come back</font>

484
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,399
<font color="yellow">if only out of sheer embarrassment.</font>

485
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,700
<font color="yellow">You're right, but...</font>

486
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,100
<font color="yellow">And I really tried to stay away, but...</font>

487
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:14,000
<font color="yellow">the fact that I'm sitting
across from you like this...</font>

488
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,799
<font color="yellow">is honestly just as shocking to me
as it is to you.</font>

489
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,399
<font color="yellow">The noodles will get soggy.</font>

490
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:29,200

soup since I bet you're not feeling well.</font>

491
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,899
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

492
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,200
<font color="yellow">But, um, how did you know
that I drank last night?</font>

493
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,000
<font color="yellow">You called me,
while you were really drunk.</font>

494
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,600
<font color="yellow">When did I do that?</font>

495
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
<font color="yellow">I checked my call logs,
but I didn't see you there.</font>

496
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,899
<font color="yellow">You used Shin Joon Young's
phone to call me.</font>

497
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:59,899
<font color="yellow">Was... Shin Joon Young
next to you when you called me?</font>

498
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,000
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

499
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:09,000
<font color="yellow">So, what did I say to you?
What did I say when I called?</font>

500
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,799
<font color="yellow">I don't know.
I don't remember.</font>

502
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:26,700
<font color="yellow">Just a second.
Let me take this call.</font>

503
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,700
<font color="yellow">What kind of trouble did you
cause this time, No Eul?</font>

504
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,899
<font color="yellow">- Yeah, Jung Eun?
- What are you up to, Ji Tae?</font>

505
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:48,799
<font color="yellow">I'm in a meeting.</font>

506
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,399
<font color="yellow">Oh, sorry for calling you
while you were working.</font>

507
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,799
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You're okay, right?</font>

508
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,600
<font color="yellow">Of course.
But, Ji Tae...</font>

509
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,700
<font color="yellow">Did you go to Shin Joon Young's
concert yesterday?</font>

510
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:08,000
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Oh. So you didn't.</font>

511
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,200
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

512
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,500
<font color="yellow">No, it's just that someone told me
that they saw you at the concert.</font>

513
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,700
<font color="yellow">I don't have enough free time to be
going to see celebrities' concerts.</font>

514
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,399
<font color="yellow">Exactly. I guess they mistook
someone else for you.</font>

515
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,200
<font color="yellow">I told them that they
were probably wrong.</font>

516
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,200
<font color="yellow">Jung Eun.</font>

517
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,799
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have dinner
with me tomorrow, if you have time?</font>

518
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,200
<font color="yellow">What's so great about
you anyway, Mister?</font>

519
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,899
<font color="yellow">You're older than Shin Joon Young,
and have less money that he does.</font>

520
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:47,899
<font color="yellow">You don't even have a car.
Shin Joon Young has three!</font>

521
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:51,399
<font color="yellow">You don't own a house, or a building!</font>

522
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:55,399
<font color="yellow">So what right do you have
to reject me?</font>

523
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,799
<font color="yellow">Give me my phone back.</font>

524
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:04,000
<font color="yellow">Mister... can't you just
think it over one more time?</font>

525
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,399
<font color="yellow">You know, I'm not really
that bad of a catch.</font>

526
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:11,500
<font color="yellow">I'll be really good
to you from now on...</font>

527
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,600
<font color="yellow">so please, say yes, Mister!</font>

528
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,500
<font color="yellow">Be my boyfriend!
Please?</font>

529
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,500
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

530
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,500
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

531
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:16,200
<font color="yellow">What should I do, No Eul?</font>

532
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:25,000
<font color="yellow">This crazy girl who has her back turned
toward me... has never once cared for me.</font>

533
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:31,700
<font color="yellow">And wants some poor guy who
threw her away... so what should I do?</font>

534
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,500
<font color="yellow">Despite everything, I am
the one and only Shin Joon Young.</font>

535
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,399
<font color="yellow">Should I try to convince you
to stop wanting him?</font>

536
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,200
<font color="yellow">Should I threaten you? Say I'll
hit you if you keep wanting him?</font>

537
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,399
<font color="yellow">It's clear that there's
something off with you...</font>

538
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,799
<font color="yellow">so should I drag you to the hospital
tomorrow to get you checked?</font>

539
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

540
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:21,600
<font color="yellow">I may have waited too long
to tell you that I like you.</font>

541
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:33,700
<font color="yellow">Should I give up on you,
and let you go to that guy?</font>

542
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,799
<font color="yellow">- Did Eul go somewhere?
- She left not too long ago.</font>

543
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,042
<font color="yellow">You didn't see her?</font>

544
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,700
<font color="yellow">Is she actually from
a really rich family?</font>

545
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,000
<font color="yellow">It looks like I'm right, judging
from your expression.</font>

546
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,600
<font color="yellow">So that's why Shin Joon Young
took her hand and ran away.</font>

547
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,500
<font color="yellow">Oh my. I hope I haven't
done anything to upset her!</font>

wouldn't have left his car here</font>

<font color="yellow">Um, no. I have no money. I, um...
all I have are loans and debts.</font>

581
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:48,200
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you rejected his
proposal in front of so many people!</font>

582
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,200
<font color="yellow">Joon Young has a huge ego, you know!</font>

583
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,600
<font color="yellow">If he really did something bad
because of you, I'll make you regret it!</font>

584
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

585
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:09,000
<font color="yellow">Oh my. You didn't go back to Seoul yet?</font>

586
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,700
<font color="yellow">Granny!</font>

587
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,100
<font color="yellow">Here, eat this.</font>

588
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:26,799
<font color="yellow">I heard that your husband went missing.</font>

589
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,700
<font color="yellow">A bunch of people came by my place
last night asking me when he left</font>

590

<font color="yellow">what you two did, and whether
or not he said anything strange.</font>

591
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,799
<font color="yellow">They were interrogating me like
an adulterous wife, I tell you!</font>

592
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:41,399
<font color="yellow">He really didn't say that he
was going somewhere?</font>

593
00:50:41,399 --> 00:50:42,399
<font color="yellow">No, he didn't!</font>

594
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:44,299
<font color="yellow">He just gave me a huge fistful of money</font>

595
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:46,200
<font color="yellow">asked me to make you some hangover soup</font>

596
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,600
<font color="yellow">when you woke up, and to give you
clothes since yours weren't dry.</font>

597
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:24,000
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

598
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,399
<font color="yellow">Eul, you really didn't
cause any trouble, did you?</font>

599
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:41,500
<font color="yellow">You didn't say, "You asshole! Go die! A
ghost should come and get you!" Right?</font>

600
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,114
<font color="yellow">You didn't say those kinds of
things to Shin Joon Young, did you?</font>

601
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,500
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

602
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:38,000
<font color="yellow">Granny!
Where is this place?</font>

603
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,799
<font color="yellow">That? That's the island,
way out over there.</font>

604
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:43,600
<font color="yellow">Is it close?</font>

605
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,000
<font color="yellow">Yeah. A 40 minute boat ride
will get you there.</font>

607
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:54,000
<font color="yellow">Um, I'm really sorry, Captain, but could
you give me a ride on your boat?</font>

608
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:20,399
<font color="yellow">Joon Young!
Shin Joon Young!</font>

611
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,799
<font color="yellow">Where are you,
Shin Joon Young?</font>

612
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:10,399
<font color="yellow">Where are you,
if you're not here?</font>

613
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:14,799
<font color="yellow">Where are you hiding,
you bastard?</font>

614
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,399
<font color="yellow">Hello, it's No Eul. You still
haven't found Joon Young?</font>

615
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:42,399
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't. I really feel like
something happened to him.</font>

616
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:50,200
<font color="yellow">If I can't find him after looking for him
today, I'm reporting it to the police!</font>

617
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:54,200
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

618
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:31,600
<font color="yellow">How can you manage to fall asleep,
when you've worried so many people?</font>

619
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:38,000
<font color="yellow">Are you shooting a movie, or something?
Way to look like a movie star.</font>

620
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:45,299
<font color="yellow">I must be crazy. I did such crazy things
because I was worried about you!</font>

621
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,799
<font color="yellow">I took an expensive cab
ride from here to Seoul!</font>

622
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:49,000
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even sleep</font>

623
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,200
<font color="yellow">because I was shivering
in the cold, waiting for a boat!</font>

624
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,399
<font color="yellow">I even got bitten by a seagull!</font>

625
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:55,799
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, my money!</font>

626
00:56:55,799 --> 00:57:00,399
<font color="yellow">I could've bought my Jik so much
meat with that kind of money!</font>

627
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,000
<font color="yellow">You're thinking that
all of this is a dream, right?</font>

628
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:22,799
<font color="yellow">It's not.
I'm really Eul.</font>

629
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,899
<font color="yellow">I came all the way here to find you!</font>

630
00:57:27,399 --> 00:57:30,393
<font color="yellow">Wow, you must really
think that you're dreaming.</font>

I'm really Eul!</font>

633
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,600
<font color="yellow">You'll come to your senses
after I pinch you.</font>

634
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:50,399
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

635
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:51,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

636
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,899
<font color="yellow">I said leave.</font>

637
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,799
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

638
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:58,100
