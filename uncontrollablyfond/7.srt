1
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,160
<font color="yellow">I came all the way here to take you to that island.</font>

2
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,720
<font color="yellow">But I'll just go alone.</font>

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,600
<font color="yellow">If I take you,</font>

4
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,360
<font color="yellow">I'll want to hide you there...</font>

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,160
<font color="yellow">so that you won't be able to go to anyone else.</font>

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,560
<font color="yellow">So don't ever appear before me.</font>

7
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,920
<font color="yellow">If I ever see you again,</font>

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,960
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take you away.</font>

9
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
<font color="yellow">How can you sleep?</font>

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,240
<font color="yellow">How can you sleep when everyone's worried sick?</font>

11
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,280
<font color="yellow">You aren't in a movie.</font>

12
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
<font color="yellow">Trying to be an actor, are you?</font>

13
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
<font color="yellow">Stupid me.</font>

14
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,250
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what I did because I was worried.</font>

15
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,700
<font color="yellow">I took a taxi here all the way from Seoul.</font>

16
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,610
<font color="yellow">I waited in the freezing cold for a boat.</font>

17
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,240
<font color="yellow">I also got bitten by a seagull.</font>

18
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my money.</font>

19
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,480
<font color="yellow">I could've fed Jik meat for days with that money.</font>

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

21
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,600
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is a dream?</font>

22
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,200
<font color="yellow">It's not. I really am Eul.</font>

23
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
<font color="yellow">I came all the way here to find you.</font>

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

25
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

26
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,120
<font color="yellow">You really do think it's a dream, don't you?</font>

27
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,920
<font color="yellow">It's me, Eul.</font>

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

30
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,720
<font color="yellow">I should pinch you awake.</font>

31
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,530
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

32
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,850
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Go away.</font>

33
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,800
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Get out of my sight.</font>

34
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

35
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,920
<font color="yellow">I guess I really did make a huge mistake.</font>

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,800
<font color="yellow">What else did I do wrong?</font>

37
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,340
<font color="yellow">If I ever drink again, I'm a real dog.</font>

38
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,480
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

39
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,600
<font color="yellow">- Here. You didn't eat breakfast, right?
-  Ouch.</font>

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

41
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,000
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you?</font>

42
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,040
<font color="yellow">I'm weird when I'm drunk.</font>

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,200
<font color="yellow">The worst thing is that I don't remember a thing.</font>

44
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
<font color="yellow">Four.</font>

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure what I did,</font>

46
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,640
<font color="yellow">so I don't know what I should be sorry about.</font>

47
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,360
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I really do want to apologise.</font>

48
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,840
<font color="yellow">Why can't I remember anything?</font>

49
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

50
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
<font color="yellow">Five.</font>

51
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
<font color="yellow">(Husband)</font>

52
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

53
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,000
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you been picking up?</font>

54
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

55
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
<font color="yellow">Well, the thing is,</font>

56
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
<font color="yellow">I had an emergency.</font>

57
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for leaving without saying goodbye.</font>

58
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,360
<font color="yellow">Are you with Shin Joon Young?</font>

59
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

60
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

61
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,440
<font color="yellow">I made a huge mistake to him.</font>

62
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'll call you back later.</font>

63
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
<font color="yellow">Going up.</font>

64
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
<font color="yellow">The doors are closing.</font>

65
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,680
<font color="yellow">Sir, take a look at this.</font>

66
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

67
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,670
<font color="yellow">I believe Ms Yoon saw those photos.</font>

68
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,920
<font color="yellow">I thought you stopped the reporters.</font>

69
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

70
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,120
<font color="yellow">Did you go to Shin Joon Young's concert last night?</font>

71
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,420
<font color="yellow">I think she started doing...</font>

72
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,240
<font color="yellow">a background check on Producer Noh.</font>

73
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,360
<font color="yellow">Why can't I remember anything?</font>

74
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,160
<font color="yellow">Stupid.</font>

75
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,640
<font color="yellow">Stupid me.</font>

76
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,840
<font color="yellow">I can't even remember a single moment.</font>

77
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,310
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

78
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,010
<font color="yellow">- Something's on your shoe.
-  Six.</font>

79
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,440
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry?</font>

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,760
<font color="yellow">I'll buy.</font>

81
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,980
<font color="yellow">Let's eat before we go.</font>

82
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,010
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

83
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,130
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

84
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
<font color="yellow">I did throw a fit while I was drunk.</font>

85
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

86
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,100
<font color="yellow">My dad told me that people who hold grudges...</font>

87
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,560
<font color="yellow">about being drunk are the pettiest people on earth.</font>

88
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960
<font color="yellow">He told me to never befriend anyone like that.</font>

89
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,890
<font color="yellow">Seven.</font>

90
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
<font color="yellow">Do you want to hit me?</font>

91
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

92
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
<font color="yellow">Hit me until you feel better.</font>

93
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

94
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,890
<font color="yellow">Eight.</font>

95
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,880
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you hold your grudges for a long time.</font>

96
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
<font color="yellow">How can you be so unforgiving?</font>

97
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,370
<font color="yellow">Honestly, you're the reason I got drunk.</font>

98
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,240
<font color="yellow">You're the contributor.</font>

99
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,760
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be apologising instead?</font>

100
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,140
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

101
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,160
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

102
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
<font color="yellow">Nine.</font>

103
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
<font color="yellow">Taxi.</font>

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
<font color="yellow">I really don't remember.</font>

105
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,880
<font color="yellow">I really don't know what I did...</font>

106
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,610
<font color="yellow">to make you this mad.</font>

107
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,780
<font color="yellow">Nine and a half.</font>

108
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,730
<font color="yellow">I remember you carrying me on your back.</font>

109
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,900
<font color="yellow">Nine and a half and a quarter.</font>

110
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,740
<font color="yellow">I also remember throwing up on your back.</font>

111
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,340
<font color="yellow">Nine and a half and a quarter and an eighth.</font>

112
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,640
<font color="yellow">You changed...</font>

113
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,840
<font color="yellow">I also remember you helping me get changed.</font>

114
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
<font color="yellow">I remember you confessing...</font>

115
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

116
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,140
<font color="yellow">Your car's right there. Why are you taking a taxi?</font>

117
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,320
<font color="yellow">Do you have money to burn?</font>

118
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,480
<font color="yellow">Where may I take you?</font>

119
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,840
<font color="yellow">To Seoul, please.</font>

120
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,340
<font color="yellow">Hey, hurry up and wake up.</font>

121
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, hey.</font>

122
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
<font color="yellow">Where's... Where's Joon Young?</font>

123
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,730
<font color="yellow">He left his car and took a taxi?</font>

124
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,680
<font color="yellow">What in the world did you do to Joon Young?</font>

125
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

126
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

127
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,360
<font color="yellow">What do you think I did...</font>

128
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
<font color="yellow">to make him so angry?</font>

129
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

130
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

131
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,960
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure I did something very wrong.</font>

132
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,540
<font color="yellow">I can't remember a thing. I really can't.</font>

133
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

134
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,280
<font color="yellow">That's not going to help.</font>

135
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,650
<font color="yellow">Doing this helped me remember a few things.</font>

136
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,720
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

137
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,560
<font color="yellow">Then come over here. Come on.</font>

138
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,120
<font color="yellow">Do you remember anything?</font>

139
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,800
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Sir. May I borrow your phone?</font>

140
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
<font color="yellow">Are... Are you Shin Joon Young?</font>

141
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,060
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

142
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,480
<font color="yellow">Here you go again.</font>

143
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,070
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Why are you taking my food?</font>

144
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,820
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. Hey, Young Deuk.</font>

145
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,930
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

146
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,030
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you to take it away...</font>

147
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,410
<font color="yellow">when she mixes everything in a bowl?</font>

148
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,690
<font color="yellow">- I forgot.
-  Give it back.</font>

149
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,740
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

150
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,560
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and spit it out.</font>

151
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,030
<font color="yellow">You already have a small stomach.</font>

152
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,220
<font color="yellow">How are you going to digest everything?</font>

153
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,380
<font color="yellow">Come on. Spit everything you have in your mouth.</font>

154
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,780
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

155
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

156
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,940
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mum. You must've been worried.</font>

157
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but you have the wrong number.</font>

158
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,060
<font color="yellow">It's Joon Young, right? It was him who called, right?</font>

159
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,740
<font color="yellow">It wasn't him.</font>

160
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,840
<font color="yellow">Really? Let me check, then.</font>

161
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,740
<font color="yellow">Jeong Sik!</font>

162
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,840
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

163
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,060
<font color="yellow">It's not your mum. It's me, Jeong Sik.</font>

164
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,540
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jeong Sik.</font>

165
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,260
<font color="yellow">Are you insane or what?</font>

166
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,270
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you've done to your mum?</font>

167
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,180
<font color="yellow">Goodness, do you know how worried she was?</font>

168
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,580
<font color="yellow">Stop lying. I wasn't worried about him.</font>

169
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,150
<font color="yellow">Hang up. Hang up the phone. My goodness.</font>

170
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,500
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, right now, your mum is eating...</font>

171
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,440
<font color="yellow">bibimbap in a huge bowl.</font>

172
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,060
<font color="yellow">You know what that means, right?</font>

173
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,400
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Sik!
-  That means...</font>

174
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,960
<font color="yellow">your mum is insanely worried about you right now.</font>

175
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,980
<font color="yellow">You know that, right?</font>

176
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

177
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,600
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

178
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

179
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,140
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

180
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,940
<font color="yellow">I know how much Mum's worried about me.</font>

181
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,260
<font color="yellow">But how did you end up...</font>

182
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,680
<font color="yellow">getting involved with a gold digger?</font>

183
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,080
<font color="yellow">My goodness, did you forget already?</font>

184
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,800
<font color="yellow">Gook Young got involved with a gold digger,</font>

185
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,880
<font color="yellow">lost all of my assets...</font>

186
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,800
<font color="yellow">down to a single underwear.</font>

187
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,470
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember what happened?</font>

188
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,990
<font color="yellow">Gook Young even went to prison because of her.</font>

189
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you...</font>

190
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,370
<font color="yellow">remember how you covered for him...</font>

191
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,070
<font color="yellow">with your front money?</font>

192
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,230
<font color="yellow">She's not a gold digger.</font>

193
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

194
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,820
<font color="yellow">Is she a silver digger, then?</font>

195
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,640
<font color="yellow">I thought you were a star.</font>

196
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,260
<font color="yellow">You said you were amazingly rich.</font>

197
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,700
<font color="yellow">But how can you have such bad taste in women?</font>

198
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,500
<font color="yellow">How dare you let such a...</font>

199
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,860
<font color="yellow">I like her, Mum.</font>

200
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,940
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

201
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,670
<font color="yellow">I just recently figured it out myself.</font>

202
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,150
<font color="yellow">I actually love her...</font>

203
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,740
<font color="yellow">a lot.</font>

204
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,670
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This is a bad one.</font>

205
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,590
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, you need to get a grip.</font>

206
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,020
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm running away.</font>

207
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,220
<font color="yellow">If I continue to see her,</font>

208
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,220
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure of what I'd do.</font>

209
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,750
<font color="yellow">So I'm running away from her.</font>

210
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,630
<font color="yellow">He wasn't joking?</font>

211
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,860
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's what I believe.</font>

212
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to say this, but I think...</font>

213
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,540
<font color="yellow">Joon Young really likes you.</font>

214
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,680
<font color="yellow">He even kicked out Pororo...</font>

215
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,660
<font color="yellow">when he found out you were allergic to dogs.</font>

216
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,560
<font color="yellow">- Unbelievable.
-  Of course.</font>

217
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,970
<font color="yellow">There are so many better women out there.</font>

218
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,760
<font color="yellow">This just isn't possible.</font>

219
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,820
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

220
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,780
<font color="yellow">He must be insane.</font>

221
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,080
<font color="yellow">Why would he like me?</font>

222
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,760
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You're a decent woman.</font>

223
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,580
<font color="yellow">You actually acknowledge the truth.</font>

224
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,910
<font color="yellow">That's something I like about you.</font>

225
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,340
<font color="yellow">I mean, of course,</font>

226
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,620
<font color="yellow">Prince Charming did marry...</font>

227
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,900
<font color="yellow">the unfortunate Cinderella.</font>

228
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
<font color="yellow">But Cinderella was a nice girl.</font>

229
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,440
<font color="yellow">She was diligent and honest, too.</font>

230
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,860
<font color="yellow">I'm nice, too.</font>

231
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,020
<font color="yellow">I'm diligent...</font>

232
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,580
<font color="yellow">and honest.</font>

233
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,180
<font color="yellow">But come to think of it,</font>

234
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,420
<font color="yellow">he did look a little sick these days.</font>

235
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,340
<font color="yellow">When he was shooting his last drama,</font>

236
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,150
<font color="yellow">he got hit hard on the head by a wooden stick.</font>

237
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,660
<font color="yellow">Maybe his brain swelled up.</font>

238
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,490
<font color="yellow">I heard that...</font>

239
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,380
<font color="yellow">you can't think straight if your brain swells up.</font>

240
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,040
<font color="yellow">I should take him to a doctor soon.</font>

241
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,420
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

242
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,750
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

243
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sitting right here.</font>

244
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,420
<font color="yellow">Do you really not remember what you said to him?</font>

245
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,140
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

246
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,990
<font color="yellow">if Joon Young wasn't joking...</font>

247
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,900
<font color="yellow">and was telling the truth...</font>

248
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,540
<font color="yellow">If he really likes me,</font>

249
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,460
<font color="yellow">what should I do?</font>

250
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,060
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to a doctor along with Joon Young.</font>

251
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,420
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Sir.</font>

252
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,380
<font color="yellow">Can you go back and drive to the back door?</font>

253
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,140
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

254
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,020
<font color="yellow">You must be hungry.</font>

255
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll go and get you some food.</font>

256
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
<font color="yellow">(Seoul)</font>

257
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,780
<font color="yellow">Shin Joon Young is in critical condition?</font>

258
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,520
<font color="yellow">A brainstem glioma?</font>

259
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. Apparently, it's in a bad location...</font>

260
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,900
<font color="yellow">and hard to operate.</font>

261
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,510
<font color="yellow">Joon Young himself is also avoiding...</font>

262
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,300
<font color="yellow">hospitalisation and treatment.</font>

263
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,470
<font color="yellow">His mum doesn't know about this, does she?</font>

264
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,140
<font color="yellow">Yes. He asked to keep it a secret...</font>

265
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,340
<font color="yellow">from his family and company.</font>

266
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,900
<font color="yellow">This is sad news...</font>

267
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,180
<font color="yellow">for Joon Young and his mum.</font>

268
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,380
<font color="yellow">He's not qualified.</font>

269
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,900
<font color="yellow">I understand that you like him,</font>

270
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,910
<font color="yellow">but he's not helpful to our party.</font>

271
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,760
<font color="yellow">Mr Choi, you're a bit too much.</font>

272
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,400
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang, you know this, too.</font>

273
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,440
<font color="yellow">He was charged with stock manipulation,</font>

274
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,180
<font color="yellow">embezzlement, malpractice and tax evasion.</font>

275
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,060
<font color="yellow">He's still being investigated by prosecution.</font>

276
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,780
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense to recommend someone like him...</font>

277
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,560
<font color="yellow">as our proportional representation candidate.</font>

278
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,200
<font color="yellow">He'll soon be cleared of all those charges.</font>

279
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,820
<font color="yellow">- There's no need to...
-  That's just temporary.</font>

280
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,380
<font color="yellow">This matter will blow up again one day.</font>

281
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sure...</font>

282
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,220
<font color="yellow">everyone here has made a few mistakes in life.</font>

283
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,340
<font color="yellow">In the process of achieving big things,</font>

284
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,620
<font color="yellow">making a few mistakes is inevitable.</font>

285
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,100
<font color="yellow">Politics is all about helping each other in need.</font>

286
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,820
<font color="yellow">That kind of politics leaves regrets.</font>

287
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,300
<font color="yellow">It makes you do things...</font>

288
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,060
<font color="yellow">even when you don't want to.</font>

289
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,860
<font color="yellow">Mr Choi, you must have a lot of free time.</font>

290
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,900
<font color="yellow">How do you have the time to regret?</font>

291
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,620
<font color="yellow">That scum.</font>

292
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,420
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

293
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,160
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

294
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,340
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, these people keep bashing Joon Young.</font>

295
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,020
<font color="yellow">My goodness, I thought there was a fire or something.</font>

296
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,580
<font color="yellow">"He's not everyone's lover."</font>

297
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,700
<font color="yellow">"How do you feel after betraying your fans for a girl?"</font>

298
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,510
<font color="yellow">"Joon Young betrayed me. I'm going to sue him."</font>

299
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,850
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

300
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,810
<font color="yellow">And look at this.</font>

301
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,080
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

302
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,930
<font color="yellow">"Same design, different betrayal."</font>

303
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,550
<font color="yellow">This is Joon Young's movie. Who did this?</font>

304
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,390
<font color="yellow">"We all got betrayed because of his first love."</font>

305
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,160
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why do people make an effort to create these?</font>

306
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,660
<font color="yellow">They must have a lot of time.</font>

307
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

308
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,140
<font color="yellow">You know that it's my dream to marry Joon Young, right?</font>

309
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,980
<font color="yellow">I told you, you can't do that.</font>

310
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,120
<font color="yellow">His past?</font>

311
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,740
<font color="yellow">I don't care about things like that.</font>

312
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,060
<font color="yellow">But I have no idea if he's dead or alive.</font>

313
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,860
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang.</font>

314
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,300
<font color="yellow">Can you bring me more perfume?</font>

315
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,600
<font color="yellow">You've already used a lot.</font>

316
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,300
<font color="yellow">Stop making a fuss and come out.</font>

317
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,200
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

318
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,620
<font color="yellow">I still smell like garbage.</font>

319
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,620
<font color="yellow">You don't smell like anything.</font>

320
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,980
<font color="yellow">I can only smell flowers.</font>

321
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,180
<font color="yellow">Come right out before your body swells up.</font>

322
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,080
<font color="yellow">I still smell bad.</font>

323
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,840
<font color="yellow">Jik, that jerk.</font>

324
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,380
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get back at him.</font>

325
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,720
<font color="yellow">- Who?
-  Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

326
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,260
<font color="yellow">He's preparing for a civil service exam.</font>

327
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,020
<font color="yellow">Which room is he in?</font>

328
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,940
<font color="yellow">Lee Hyun Woo?</font>

329
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,880
<font color="yellow">I've never heard of that name.</font>

330
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,920
<font color="yellow">That's weird. He lived here for over two years.</font>

331
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

332
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
<font color="yellow">This is him.</font>

333
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,400
<font color="yellow">I've never seen him.</font>

334
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,520
<font color="yellow">That can't be. Can you take another look?</font>

335
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,540
<font color="yellow">Let's see...</font>

336
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,780
<font color="yellow">(Brother-in-law)</font>

337
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,220
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

338
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,360
<font color="yellow">I'm at your place.</font>

339
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,460
<font color="yellow">My place?</font>

340
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,060
<font color="yellow">I actually moved.</font>

341
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,390
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you?</font>

342
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,940
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

343
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,520
<font color="yellow">Where did you move to?</font>

344
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,790
<font color="yellow">I'll go there.</font>

345
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,300
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

346
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,060
<font color="yellow">Something came up at home, so I'm at Daejeon.</font>

347
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,300
<font color="yellow">Why? Is this urgent?</font>

348
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,420
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way back to Seoul,</font>

349
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,820
<font color="yellow">so I'll go to that store you work at.</font>

350
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,580
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you.</font>

351
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

352
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,660
<font color="yellow">Why were you looking for me so urgently?</font>

353
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

354
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,820
<font color="yellow">Here. This is the most expensive drink here.</font>

355
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,220
<font color="yellow">What's this for?</font>

356
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,080
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

357
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,960
<font color="yellow">I still have 10 minutes until my shift ends,</font>

358
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,460
<font color="yellow">so I'll make it short and quick.</font>

359
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

360
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,020
<font color="yellow">My sister used to have a crush on Joon Young.</font>

361
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,400
<font color="yellow">It's when we lived in Suyu-ri.</font>

362
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,860
<font color="yellow">I saw what she wrote in her diary.</font>

363
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,540
<font color="yellow">She gave up on him because he was Na Ri's boyfriend.</font>

364
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,200
<font color="yellow">So she'll probably easily fall for him...</font>

365
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,380
<font color="yellow">if he starts to show interest in her.</font>

366
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,860
<font color="yellow">But isn't it a good thing...</font>

367
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,820
<font color="yellow">if a superstar like him likes Eul?</font>

368
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,380
<font color="yellow">Joon Young and my sister are...</font>

369
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,560
<font color="yellow">living in different worlds now.</font>

370
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,820
<font color="yellow">She needs to meet someone similar.</font>

371
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,060
<font color="yellow">Someone who lives, eats...</font>

372
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,980
<font color="yellow">and dresses like her.</font>

373
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,100
<font color="yellow">Someone who has the same view in life.</font>

374
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,940
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

375
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,300
<font color="yellow">what is it that you're trying to say?</font>

376
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,900
<font color="yellow">Can you hold her down?</font>

377
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,540
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can...</font>

378
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,300
<font color="yellow">bring her back to reality.</font>

379
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

380
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,520
<font color="yellow">Ouch.</font>

381
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,740
<font color="yellow">Where are the gloves?</font>

382
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,960
<font color="yellow">When did you wake up?</font>

383
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,880
<font color="yellow">You seemed to be asleep, so I didn't wake you.</font>

384
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
<font color="yellow">Your manager let me in through the back door.</font>

385
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,560
<font color="yellow">Your front door was filled with reporters.</font>

386
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,180
<font color="yellow">Nine...</font>

387
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,410
<font color="yellow">and a half and a quarter and an eighth and a sixteenth.</font>

388
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,820
<font color="yellow">I'm fine now.</font>

389
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,960
<font color="yellow">I have thick fingers, so it doesn't really hurt.</font>

390
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,520
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

391
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,080
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat?</font>

392
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

393
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,360
<font color="yellow">I put in so much effort to cook that.</font>

394
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,640
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Don't eat, then.</font>

395
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat it all.</font>

396
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

397
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,960
<font color="yellow">All that matters is the taste.</font>

398
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,800
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's salty.</font>

399
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it,</font>

400
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
<font color="yellow">does he think I have a disease or what?</font>

401
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,240
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep avoiding me?</font>

402
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,920
<font color="yellow">If he's mad, he can just tell me what he's mad about.</font>

403
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,120
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how petty.</font>

404
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,480
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you doing?</font>

405
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,200
<font color="yellow">He turned the lights on and turned them off again?</font>

406
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,560
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What in the world are you imagining?</font>

407
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,920
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kim, why are you being like this?</font>

408
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,320
<font color="yellow">I just sent the housekeeper there to feed his dog.</font>

409
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,900
<font color="yellow">Joon Young really isn't at home.</font>

410
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,100
<font color="yellow">Stop wasting your time and just go home.</font>

411
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
<font color="yellow">Aren't your kids waiting for you?</font>

412
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,060
<font color="yellow">Best comments of the day.</font>

413
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,520
<font color="yellow">"No one has seen Joon Young or Eul for two days."</font>

414
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,210
<font color="yellow">"Maybe they committed suicide like Romeo and Juliet."</font>

415
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,840
<font color="yellow">To be honest, Joon Young just called me and said...</font>

416
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,680
<font color="yellow">he did what he did out of stress.</font>

417
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,640
<font color="yellow">He acted without thinking, and he regrets what he did.</font>

418
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,690
<font color="yellow">So I told him that...</font>

419
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,520
<font color="yellow">anyone in his shoes would've gone crazy...</font>

420
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,740
<font color="yellow">and that he should go somewhere to take a few days off.</font>

421
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,620
<font color="yellow">Wow, Producer Noh.</font>

422
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,060
<font color="yellow">"Will she become a Juliet instead of a gold digger?"</font>

423
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,600
<font color="yellow">Can't you go through a day without those comments?</font>

424
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

425
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,320
<font color="yellow">He's definitely...</font>

426
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,480
<font color="yellow">not by himself.</font>

427
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
<font color="yellow">He's with his manager.</font>

428
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,170
<font color="yellow">Producer Noh is probably already in Seoul.</font>

429
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,320
<font color="yellow">Call her if you don't believe me.</font>

430
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,400
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

431
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,920
<font color="yellow">Yes. If Joon Young really likes Producer Noh,</font>

432
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,280
<font color="yellow">I'll kill myself in front of you.</font>

433
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,700
<font color="yellow">Yes. If he has that bad of a taste in women,</font>

434
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,150
<font color="yellow">I will give up my career and my life.</font>

435
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,480
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't promise him that so easily.</font>

436
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,730
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

437
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,080
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

438
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,920
<font color="yellow">Joon Young actually has a girlfriend.</font>

439
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,320
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

440
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
<font color="yellow">Kim Yoo Na.</font>

441
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,410
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yoo Na, the actress in my agency.</font>

442
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,820
<font color="yellow">She's dating Joon Young right now.</font>

443
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,690
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

444
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,560
<font color="yellow">It's been about a year.</font>

445
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,520
<font color="yellow">Someone reporter kept on...</font>

446
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,260
<font color="yellow">coming after Joon Young and Yoo Na,</font>

447
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,440
<font color="yellow">so this was all a performance to draw his eyes away.</font>

448
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,320
<font color="yellow">Are you satisfied now?</font>

449
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,000
<font color="yellow">Are these Christmas roses again?</font>

450
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,940
<font color="yellow">I believe Ms Yoon saw those pictures.</font>

451
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,480
<font color="yellow">They suit you well.</font>

452
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,120
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ji Tae.</font>

453
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,100
<font color="yellow">I think she started doing...</font>

454
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,970
<font color="yellow">a background check on Producer Noh.</font>

455
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want another glass of wine?</font>

456
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,640
<font color="yellow">Forget the wine.</font>

457
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,240
<font color="yellow">I want something else.</font>

458
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
<font color="yellow">I want a kiss.</font>

459
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,210
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

460
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,690
<font color="yellow">Why not? We'll get married soon, anyway.</font>

461
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,560
<font color="yellow">I heard you saw that picture.</font>

462
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,320
<font color="yellow">The picture of Shin Joon Young, me and that girl.</font>

463
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,300
<font color="yellow">Her name is Noh Eul, and she's 28 years old.</font>

464
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
<font color="yellow">She's a freelance documentary producer.</font>

465
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,420
<font color="yellow">She graduated from Korea National Open University.</font>

466
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,560
<font color="yellow">Her parents passed away, and she has a younger brother.</font>

467
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,730
<font color="yellow">You don't need to do a background check on her.</font>

468
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,170
<font color="yellow">What are you getting at?</font>

469
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,100
<font color="yellow">I wanted to save you the trouble.</font>

470
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,210
<font color="yellow">What is your relationship...</font>

471
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
<font color="yellow">with that girl?</font>

472
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,170
<font color="yellow">I won't answer that question.</font>

473
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,560
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  If I answer that question,</font>

474
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,560
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to keep my promise to you.</font>

475
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,640
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

476
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,520
<font color="yellow">Do you like her?</font>

477
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,120
<font color="yellow">Let's have another glass of wine.</font>

478
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,560
<font color="yellow">Answer me, Ji Tae.</font>

479
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you.</font>

480
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,210
<font color="yellow">Answer me, Choi Ji Tae!</font>

481
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

482
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,280
<font color="yellow">I like her.</font>

483
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,210
<font color="yellow">I heard that...</font>

484
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
<font color="yellow">a Christmas rose means this.</font>

485
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,120
<font color="yellow">"I have nothing to give to you."</font>

486
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,730
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

487
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

488
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,440
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

489
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
<font color="yellow">you regret...</font>

490
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,170
<font color="yellow">this moment.</font>

491
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,080
<font color="yellow">The reporters are still here.</font>

492
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,240
<font color="yellow">The back door is covered with them, too.</font>

493
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,360
<font color="yellow">They'll think I'm here if the lights are on.</font>

494
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,960
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What a situation.</font>

495
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,840
<font color="yellow">Let's hope they'll leave in about two hours.</font>

496
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,640
<font color="yellow">You can leave then.</font>

497
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,800
<font color="yellow">Jik's friend...</font>

498
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,080
<font color="yellow">came home after midnight after his academy,</font>

499
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,360
<font color="yellow">and his mum was waiting for him in the elevator.</font>

500
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,880
<font color="yellow">The elevator went up from the first floor...</font>

501
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,520
<font color="yellow">to the second floor...</font>

502
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,480
<font color="yellow">and to the third floor.</font>

503
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,730
<font color="yellow">It kept on going up.</font>

504
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,320
<font color="yellow">Suddenly, his mum said this.</font>

505
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,240
<font color="yellow">"Do I still look like your mum to you?"</font>

506
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

507
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,600
<font color="yellow">It's a ghost story.</font>

508
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,920
<font color="yellow">Your fans said that you're scared of it.</font>

509
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,040
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make fun of you.</font>

510
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,540
<font color="yellow">"Do I still look like your mum to you?"</font>

511
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,170
<font color="yellow">- There's a ghost behind you.
-  What?</font>

512
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,960
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

513
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,240
<font color="yellow">Nine and a half and a quarter...</font>

514
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,920
<font color="yellow">and an eighth and a sixteenth...</font>

515
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,080
<font color="yellow">and a thirty-second.</font>

516
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,240
<font color="yellow">It looks like you're more afraid of ghosts.</font>

517
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,760
<font color="yellow">Can you turn on the lights?</font>

518
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,880
<font color="yellow">These curtains are light-proof.</font>

519
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me that now?</font>

520
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,730
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make fun of you.</font>

521
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,800
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die? Was that funny?</font>

522
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,480
<font color="yellow">Did you enjoy making fun of me?</font>

523
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
<font color="yellow">And 10.</font>

524
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,000
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I counted to 10.</font>

525
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,800
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to run away.</font>

526
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,320
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

527
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,640
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to run away.</font>

528
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,880
<font color="yellow">You're the one who decided to stay.</font>

529
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,840
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

530
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,840
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Let's eat.</font>

531
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,320
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat.
-  I thought you weren't eating.</font>

532
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,360
<font color="yellow">I never said that.</font>

533
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,040
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

534
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

535
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,170
<font color="yellow">Why did you change...</font>

536
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,730
<font color="yellow">- all of a sudden?
-  What?</font>

537
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,090
<font color="yellow">You just changed completely.</font>

538
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,440
<font color="yellow">You're confusing me.</font>

539
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,760
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

540
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,120
<font color="yellow">Are you Joon Young's twin brother?</font>

541
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,730
<font color="yellow">How could that be?</font>

542
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,690
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too salty?</font>

543
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,560
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

544
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

545
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
<font color="yellow">You have a blister.</font>

546
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,880
<font color="yellow">I'll bring medicine.</font>

547
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,170
<font color="yellow">What is this? Who is that?</font>

548
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,520
<font color="yellow">Is he a ghost?</font>

549
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,560
<font color="yellow">You spit everything out, didn't you?</font>

550
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,960
<font color="yellow">No. Why would I spit out something you made?</font>

551
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,920
<font color="yellow">So you are human.</font>

552
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,320
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

553
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,060
<font color="yellow">a ghost took you over...</font>

554
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,580
<font color="yellow">and came back in his form.</font>

555
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,090
<font color="yellow">Do I still look like Joon Young to you?</font>

556
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,120
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

557
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,960
<font color="yellow">What's with the sudden change?</font>

558
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,000
<font color="yellow">You're scaring me.</font>

559
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,720
<font color="yellow">You were telling me to go away just a while ago.</font>

560
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?</font>

561
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,290
<font color="yellow">Can I not be nice to you?</font>

562
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,800
<font color="yellow">If one suddenly changes, that means one will die soon.</font>

563
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

564
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

565
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,640
<font color="yellow">You waited a long time, didn't you?</font>

566
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being late.</font>

567
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,180
<font color="yellow">Were you getting ready to go out?</font>

568
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,160
<font color="yellow">No, where would I go at this hour?</font>

569
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,760
<font color="yellow">I thought there would be reporters.</font>

570
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,580
<font color="yellow">I think they're all gone.</font>

571
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,680
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

572
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,380
<font color="yellow">Gosh, then they should've told me so.</font>

573
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,920
<font color="yellow">I even blow-dried my hair.</font>

574
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,330
<font color="yellow">Where's Eul?</font>

575
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,680
<font color="yellow">Eul's not home.</font>

576
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,770
<font color="yellow">- She's not?
-  No.</font>

577
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,120
<font color="yellow">Her phone's off too, right?</font>

578
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,840
<font color="yellow">She said she was almost out of batteries a while ago.</font>

579
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,480
<font color="yellow">Is she with Joon Young?</font>

580
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,010
<font color="yellow">Yes. She said she had to take care of something.</font>

581
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,640
<font color="yellow">She told me to go to sleep first.</font>

582
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,600
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Dad.
-  Where are you?</font>

583
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,980
<font color="yellow">Let's go and grab a drink.</font>

584
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,920
<font color="yellow">Mum will get mad if I drink with you.</font>

585
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,900
<font color="yellow">You should stop drinking, too.</font>

586
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,120
<font color="yellow">I promise I won't drink after today.</font>

587
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,880
<font color="yellow">Please be a friend...</font>

588
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,900
<font color="yellow">and drink with me just for today, Ji Tae.</font>

589
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,920
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

590
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,920
<font color="yellow">I'm caught up with something right now.</font>

591
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,650
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

592
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,920
<font color="yellow">Mum will be worried.</font>

593
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,680
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

594
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,160
<font color="yellow">You only care about your mother, don't you?</font>

595
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,080
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

596
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,080
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at home.</font>

597
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,880
<font color="yellow">(Madam Song)</font>

598
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,240
<font color="yellow">I'll drive from here.</font>

599
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,760
<font color="yellow">You can go home.</font>

600
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,860
<font color="yellow">Stop staring. You'll pierce a hole in me.</font>

601
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

602
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,220
<font color="yellow">Should I...</font>

603
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,620
<font color="yellow">just sit here as always?</font>

604
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,380
<font color="yellow">Without pouring drinks...</font>

605
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,740
<font color="yellow">or acting cute?</font>

606
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,460
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

607
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,500
<font color="yellow">Are you going to leave again...</font>

608
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,380
<font color="yellow">without even holding my hand?</font>

609
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

610
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,760
<font color="yellow">Are you that afraid of your wife?</font>

611
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,980
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

612
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,800
<font color="yellow">In that case,</font>

613
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,320
<font color="yellow">what about Young Ok?</font>

614
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,400
<font color="yellow">Was she your ex-girlfriend?</font>

615
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,120
<font color="yellow">That lady who looks like me.</font>

616
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,880
<font color="yellow">You'd call me Young Ok...</font>

617
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,380
<font color="yellow">whenever you got drunk.</font>

618
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

619
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,120
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

620
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,900
<font color="yellow">She's my ex-girlfriend.</font>

621
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,740
<font color="yellow">If she's still lingering in your mind,</font>

622
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,840
<font color="yellow">you must've loved her a lot.</font>

623
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:16,960
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

624
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,220
