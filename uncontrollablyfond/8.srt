<font color="yellow">Stop it, Joon Young.</font>

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,360
<font color="yellow">The entire nation knows that you're a good actor.</font>

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,280
<font color="yellow">So stop it already.</font>

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,360
<font color="yellow">Think about what you did to her.</font>

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
<font color="yellow">How can you even look at her in the eye...</font>

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,480
<font color="yellow">and say that you like her?</font>

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,760
<font color="yellow">Jik kept telling me to be careful.</font>

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,880
<font color="yellow">He said you and I live in different worlds now.</font>

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,120
<font color="yellow">He told me not to get confused...</font>

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="yellow">on every little thing you do.</font>

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,360
<font color="yellow">He told me not to get shaken or hurt.</font>

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,520
<font color="yellow">He tried to warn me.</font>

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,760
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm the crazy one here! I'm the crazy one!</font>

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,120
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.</font>

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
<font color="yellow">Never once...</font>

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,880
<font color="yellow">did I use you or toy with you.</font>

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,200
<font color="yellow">Focus only on me.</font>

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
<font color="yellow">Listen only to me.</font>

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,840

<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,920
<font color="yellow">Don't go, Eul.</font>

27
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
<font color="yellow">We were just coworkers who got along well.</font>

28
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
<font color="yellow">But then things just happened.</font>

29
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,990
<font color="yellow">We're too busy to meet up nowadays.</font>

30
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,240
<font color="yellow">My gosh, don't say that. Stars always say that.</font>

31
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
<font color="yellow">At your birthday party, I heard...</font>

32
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,120
<font color="yellow">Joon Young gave you a bouquet of 1,000 roses...</font>

33
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,960
<font color="yellow">and sang you a song.</font>

34
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,200
<font color="yellow">Everyone's talking about it.</font>

35
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,760
<font color="yellow">(Joon Young confessed his love for her on her birthday)</font>

36
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
<font color="yellow">Well, that was...</font>

37
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,980
<font color="yellow">He's a busy man. I didn't think he'd come.</font>

38
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,970
<font color="yellow">He just suddenly showed up.</font>

39
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,500
<font color="yellow">I was very surprised.</font>

40
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,180
<font color="yellow">But after his concert, Joon Young...</font>

41
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,240
<font color="yellow">just disappeared...</font>

42
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,760
<font color="yellow">hand-in-hand with the producer of his documentary...</font>

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,240
<font color="yellow">after proposing to her.</font>

44
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,370
<font color="yellow">Did that shock you?</font>

45
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,460
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

46
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,640
<font color="yellow">I guess not.</font>

47
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,240
<font color="yellow">It was a show to shield you from prying reporters.</font>

48
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,320
<font color="yellow">You knew about it in advance, right?</font>

49
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

50
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,090
<font color="yellow">She must be friends with a warlock.</font>

51
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,000
<font color="yellow">I'm amazed. Your acting was on point.</font>

52
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
<font color="yellow">If so...</font>

53
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

54
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
<font color="yellow">Did you also know in advance...</font>

55
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,680
<font color="yellow">that Joon Young used you to cover up the scandal?</font>

56
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
<font color="yellow">Well, first of all,</font>

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,510
<font color="yellow">he's a warm-hearted guy. He's also considerate...</font>

58
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,500
<font color="yellow">- Of course I did. - and sincere.</font>

59
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,580
<font color="yellow">He told me at the concert hall.</font>

60
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,700
<font color="yellow">He told me what he'd do...</font>

61
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,340
<font color="yellow">and asked me to react appropriately.</font>

62
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,920
<font color="yellow">So you're saying you put on an act, as well?</font>

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

64
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,760
<font color="yellow">What did you think? Wasn't I pretty impressive?</font>

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,760
<font color="yellow">I think should try acting.</font>

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
<font color="yellow">I'm really out of words.</font>

67
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me this now?</font>

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,080
<font color="yellow">We were so worried about you because we had no clue.</font>

69
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,100
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. - Sorry won't cut it this time.</font>

70
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,540
<font color="yellow">Because of you, your poor brother skipped school.</font>

71
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,920
<font color="yellow">He couldn't sleep or eat.</font>

72
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
<font color="yellow">Not to mention Hyun Woo who...</font>

73
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,000
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You're such a brat.</font>

74
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,020
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you.</font>

75
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,280
<font color="yellow">You deserve to die.</font>

76
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,200
<font color="yellow">I'm tired.</font>

77
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,160
<font color="yellow">Will you please stop?</font>

78
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,920
<font color="yellow">Would you like to say anything to our viewers?</font>

79
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,420
<font color="yellow">Hello, everyone.</font>

80
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,930
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologise for confusing you...</font>

81
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,680
<font color="yellow">and not telling the truth.</font>

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,900
<font color="yellow">To protect my name,</font>

83
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,060
<font color="yellow">Joon Young went too far and had to take the blame.</font>

84
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,020
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't blame him for anything.</font>

85
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,480
<font color="yellow">Again, I would like to apologise to his fans and mine.</font>

86
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,240
<font color="yellow">Playing the lead...</font>

87
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
<font color="yellow">in a miniseries...</font>

88
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,060
<font color="yellow">really helped improve her acting skills.</font>

89
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,660
<font color="yellow">I'll sue anyone who says her acting is horrible.</font>

90
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,310
<font color="yellow">Sir, you're deceiving the whole nation.</font>

91
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,840
<font color="yellow">We aren't fraudsters.</font>

92
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
<font color="yellow">What are people saying?</font>

93
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,110
<font color="yellow">"Korea's Brangelina is born."</font>

94
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,760
<font color="yellow">"This is the class of a Hallyu star."</font>

95
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
<font color="yellow">"He cares for his woman."</font>

96
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,420
<font color="yellow">"Joon Young's so chivalrous."</font>

97
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,240
<font color="yellow">"Is there another one like him?"</font>

98
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,280
<font color="yellow">"I'm a bit like Yoo Na myself."</font>

99
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,180
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

100
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
<font color="yellow">You'd expect Joon Young to date...</font>

101
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
<font color="yellow">a girl like Yoo Na.</font>

102
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,340
<font color="yellow">Not a common girl like that...</font>

103
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,580
<font color="yellow">I see why you'd go on with this.</font>

104
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,620
<font color="yellow">What does Yoo Na get out of taking part in this con?</font>

105
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,360
<font color="yellow">Even if she's your cousin's daughter...</font>

106
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,040
<font color="yellow">She was offered four commercials since the scandal.</font>

107
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,160
<font color="yellow">After her movie failed,</font>

108
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,880
<font color="yellow">people complained that a supporting actress...</font>

109
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,610
<font color="yellow">had stolen the lead role.</font>

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
<font color="yellow">But no one's saying that after the scandal broke.</font>

111
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
<font color="yellow">This is what we call, "mutually beneficial".</font>

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,400
<font color="yellow">Still, this is wrong.</font>

113
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
<font color="yellow">What does that make Producer Noh?</font>

114
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,280
<font color="yellow">"The poor producer."</font>

115
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,080
<font color="yellow">"Was she bullet bait for the two stars?"</font>

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,460
<font color="yellow">"Ms Bullet Bait."</font>

117
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,860
<font color="yellow">"If you need protection,"</font>

118
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,500
<font color="yellow">"hire Producer Noh."</font>

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,090
<font color="yellow">"Call the hotline at 1288-1288."</font>

120
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,500
<font color="yellow">"Call us now."</font>

121
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,310
<font color="yellow">See? It worked out for her, as well.</font>

122
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,020
<font color="yellow">If Joon Young's fans saw her anywhere,</font>

123
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,710
<font color="yellow">she would've gotten killed by them.</font>

124
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,500
<font color="yellow">But they don't even call her a gold digger any more.</font>

125
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,460
<font color="yellow">I still think this is wrong.</font>

126
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,980
<font color="yellow">The person Joon Young actually likes is Noh...</font>

127
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,980
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

128
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,120
<font color="yellow">But why is Joon Young so quiet?</font>

129
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,710
<font color="yellow">Right? What with his temper, he should have yelled...</font>

130
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,900
<font color="yellow">and grabbed Mr Nam Goong's collar by now.</font>

131
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,900
<font color="yellow">But he's not even showing up. I feel scared.</font>

132
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,950
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

133
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that's odd?</font>

134
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,770
<font color="yellow">He hasn't called once.</font>

135
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,320
<font color="yellow">This isn't like him.</font>

136
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,340
<font color="yellow">Maybe...</font>

137
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,900
<font color="yellow">- he didn't read the news yet. - That's not possible.</font>

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,140
<font color="yellow">The scandal's the only thing on TV, the net and papers.</font>

139
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,950
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

140
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,160
<font color="yellow">they cut the power to his house?</font>

141
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,540
<font color="yellow">He'd still have access to the internet.</font>

142
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,380
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

143
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,340
<font color="yellow">Talking about it just made me feel worse.</font>

144
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,020
<font color="yellow">Why did you two have to bring that up?</font>

145
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,530
<font color="yellow">Hi, old man.</font>

146
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,590
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the food.</font>

147
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,270
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

148
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,610
<font color="yellow">Isn't it the cheese?</font>

149
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, old man.</font>

150
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,070
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say your brother's rich?</font>

151
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I don't have a brother.</font>

152
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
<font color="yellow">Thanks, old man.</font>

153
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,350
<font color="yellow">I love you, man.</font>

154
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,010
<font color="yellow">Your brother's awesome.</font>

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,330
<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

156
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,010

00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,750
<font color="yellow">If you don't believe me,</font>

468
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,480
<font color="yellow">- I can sign a memo. - Why would you do that?</font>

469
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,950
<font color="yellow">You're making me angry.</font>

470
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,530
<font color="yellow">If that's not enough,</font>

471
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,310
<font color="yellow">- I can just disappear. - Eul.</font>

472
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,110
<font color="yellow">I'll disappear to where...</font>

473
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,910
<font color="yellow">Joon Young can't find me.</font>

474
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,070
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait.</font>

475
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,670
<font color="yellow">Don't poke too hard...</font>

476
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,990
<font color="yellow">just because you hate me.</font>

477
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,950
<font color="yellow">When will you poke?</font>

478
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,130
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it yet.</font>

479
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,240
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

480
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,190
<font color="yellow">Please don't hate me too much.</font>

481
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,390
<font color="yellow">I don't hate you.</font>

482
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,350
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

483
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,950
<font color="yellow">I'd want to kill me if I were you.</font>

484
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,990
<font color="yellow">I don't. You know where you stand.</font>

485
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,240
<font color="yellow">What's 7 times 8?</font>

486
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,240
<font color="yellow">- What? - The times table.</font>

487
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,910
<font color="yellow">What's 7 times 8?</font>

488
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,630
<font color="yellow">- It's 56. - You're sane.</font>

489
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,670
<font color="yellow">Your head's fine.</font>

490
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,070
<font color="yellow">When Gook Young...</font>

491
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,240
<font color="yellow">fell madly in love with a gold digger,</font>

492
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,280
<font color="yellow">he said 3 times 3 was 8.</font>

493
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,430
<font color="yellow">What's 8 times 7, then?</font>

494
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,370
<font color="yellow">- It's 56. - Good.</font>

495
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,550
<font color="yellow">You're fine.</font>

496
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,790
<font color="yellow">Why would someone who's still sane...</font>

497
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,610
<font color="yellow">fall for someone who wears cheap sneakers?</font>

498
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,090
<font color="yellow">Girls who wear sparkly high heels...</font>

499
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,280
<font color="yellow">must be all around you all the time.</font>

500
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,390
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

501
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,550
<font color="yellow">Why did I forego girls who wear expensive heels...</font>

502
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,550
<font color="yellow">and fall for a girl who wears cheap shoes?</font>

503
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,950
<font color="yellow">The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree.</font>

504
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,650
<font color="yellow">Your father...</font>

505
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,150
<font color="yellow">ignored all the smart and pretty college girls...</font>

506
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,950
<font color="yellow">to fall for your mother who thought that Gandhi...</font>

507
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,430
<font color="yellow">was a Korean monk.</font>

508
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,830
<font color="yellow">When you grow older and learn how the world works,</font>

509
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,390
<font color="yellow">you'll see that high heels are better than sneakers.</font>

510
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,670
<font color="yellow">You'll forget all about when you fell for...</font>

511
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,910
<font color="yellow">cheap sneakers.</font>

512
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,190
<font color="yellow">Just like that.</font>

513
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,240
<font color="yellow">Just like Choi Hyun Joon.</font>

514
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,310
<font color="yellow">With all his connections,</font>

515
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,240
<font color="yellow">he could've easily tracked down your mum.</font>

516
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,030
<font color="yellow">But all these years, he never did.</font>

517
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,990
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

518
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,720
<font color="yellow">How about you get changed?</font>

519
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,470
<font color="yellow">He might find out...</font>

520
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,910
<font color="yellow">that you've fallen for a lowly girl.</font>

521
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,550
<font color="yellow">Do you like her that much?</font>

522
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,190
<font color="yellow">Enough to exchange your expensive suit...</font>

523
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,470
<font color="yellow">for a cheap jacket to blend into her surroundings?</font>

524
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,390
<font color="yellow">I want to spend time with my family.</font>

525
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,310
<font color="yellow">I'll have Mr Kang drive you home.</font>

526
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,150
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - What?</font>

527
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,790
<font color="yellow">Ji Tae.</font>

528
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,510
<font color="yellow">Fortunately,</font>

529
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,150
<font color="yellow">it wasn't what we feared.</font>

530
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,240
<font color="yellow">Everything came back normal.</font>

531
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,990
<font color="yellow">You can leave tomorrow...</font>

532
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,020
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

533
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,790
<font color="yellow">I fear for my health and my life.</font>

534
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,470
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

535
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,600
<font color="yellow">I received my husband's kidney and it extended my life,</font>

536
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,630
<font color="yellow">but you can't say I'm cured.</font>

537
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,430
<font color="yellow">A transplanted kidney lasts about 10 to 15 years.</font>

538
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,240
<font color="yellow">That's only a statistic.</font>

539
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,150
<font color="yellow">A kidney can fail at any time.</font>

540
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,110
<font color="yellow">So you could say I'm terminally ill.</font>

541
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,890
<font color="yellow">Madam.</font>

542
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,110
<font color="yellow">"Our staff will do their best,"</font>

543
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,510
<font color="yellow">"but the family members,"</font>

544
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,190
<font color="yellow">"especially you, Mr Choi, as her husband,"</font>

545
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,690
<font color="yellow">"must do your best to help her relax."</font>

546
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,720
<font color="yellow">"Shower her with care and attention."</font>

547
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,450
<font color="yellow">"Another surgery..."</font>

548
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,670
<font color="yellow">"could have drastic results."</font>

549
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,170
<font color="yellow">Could you say that...</font>

550
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,470
<font color="yellow">to my husband?</font>

551
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,150
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

552
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,950
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

553
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,090
<font color="yellow">Are the results back?</font>

554
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,590
<font color="yellow">How ill is she?</font>

555
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to have to say this.</font>

556
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,070
<font color="yellow">There are some causes for concern.</font>

557
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,990
<font color="yellow">Is her body rejecting the kidney?</font>

558
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,580
<font color="yellow">Her condition...</font>

559
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,550
<font color="yellow">is not that serious yet, but...</font>

560
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,550
<font color="yellow">What, then?</font>

561
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,630
<font color="yellow">What can we do?</font>

562
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,830
<font color="yellow">What must I do?</font>

563
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,030
<font color="yellow">You and I will become a family in a month's time.</font>

564
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,870
<font color="yellow">I told your mother at the sauna that...</font>

565
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,630
<font color="yellow">I would like to become her daughter-in-law soon.</font>

566
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,670
<font color="yellow">Your parents' wedding anniversary is next month.</font>

567
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,110
<font color="yellow">I suggested we get married then.</font>

568
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,910
<font color="yellow">Your mother looked overjoyed.</font>

569
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,790
<font color="yellow">You should have...</font>

570
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,990
<font color="yellow">been there to see her face.</font>

571
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,040
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

572
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,910
<font color="yellow">How... Why...</font>

573
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,470
<font color="yellow">You can't pour fish sauce like it's water!</font>

574
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,150
<font color="yellow">It's salty. It's so salty.</font>

575
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,110
<font color="yellow">What's the fuss about?</font>

576
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,310
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, you fool?</font>

577
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,470
<font color="yellow">You said it's salty.</font>

578
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,550
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

579
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,150
<font color="yellow">Isn't Eul pretty...</font>

580
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,070
<font color="yellow">just like how you once were?</font>

581
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,870
<font color="yellow">But she won't become like you.</font>

582
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,810
<font color="yellow">I won't let her live the life you did.</font>

583
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,520
<font color="yellow">She won't suffer...</font>

584
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,190
<font color="yellow">or feel discriminated or belittled.</font>

585
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,310
<font color="yellow">The lettuce tastes terrible.</font>

586
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,830
<font color="yellow">Did I get a bad batch?</font>

587
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,070
<font color="yellow">I won't let her run off like you did.</font>

588
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,240
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the lettuce you sold me?</font>

589
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,990
<font color="yellow">You said they were the best, but they're falling apart.</font>

590
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,990
<font color="yellow">Didn't I say I wouldn't buy from you if you lied again?</font>

591
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,240
<font color="yellow">How dare they lie about food.</font>

592
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,990
<font color="yellow">Whatever you say, I won't let her go.</font>

593
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,070
<font color="yellow">I won't give up on her even if I die.</font>

594
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,630
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever I want from now on.</font>

595
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,390
<font color="yellow">Why is it so quiet?</font>

596
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,670
<font color="yellow">Did Young Ok kill him or something?</font>

597
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,280
<font color="yellow">Did you hear everything?</font>

598
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,310
<font color="yellow">You could hear from here, right?</font>

599
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,110
<font color="yellow">Not everything,</font>

600
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,670
<font color="yellow">but I heard most of it.</font>

601
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,300
<font color="yellow">Joon Young may look like a top star,</font>

602
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,970
<font color="yellow">but to be truthful, his mum never...</font>

603
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,510
<font color="yellow">cooked him a warm meal whenever he came by.</font>

604
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,630
<font color="yellow">All he gets is an earful of curses and complaints.</font>

605
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,760
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

606
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,930
<font color="yellow">did he drift apart from his mother?</font>

607
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,070
<font color="yellow">Don't even go there.</font>

608
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,670
<font color="yellow">She expected him to become a prosecutor,</font>

609
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,770
<font color="yellow">but he quit school to become a celebrity.</font>

610
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,240
<font color="yellow">His mum lost her mind...</font>

611
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,550
<font color="yellow">Ask Joon Young to tell you the rest.</font>

612
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,910
<font color="yellow">What does your father do?</font>

613
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,150
<font color="yellow">My mum's a single mother.</font>

614
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,990
<font color="yellow">She had me when she was 22.</font>

615
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,870
<font color="yellow">My father...</font>

616
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,430
<font color="yellow">wasn't in the picture from the start.</font>

617
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,310
<font color="yellow">When I was in high school,</font>

618
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,390
<font color="yellow">she worked at a bar to pay for a tutor.</font>

619
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,710
<font color="yellow">Then she got caught trying to bribe my teacher.</font>

620
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,030
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stand going to school after that.</font>

621
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,670
