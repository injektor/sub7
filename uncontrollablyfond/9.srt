1
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,420
<font color="yellow">She's the girl I like.</font>

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,220
<font color="yellow">I told you over the phone last time.</font>

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,832
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I can't stop thinking of her.</font>

4
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,740
<font color="yellow">She's been on my mind for the last nine years.</font>

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,060
<font color="yellow">And I realised that I'm madly in love with her...</font>

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,980
<font color="yellow">only about two weeks ago.</font>

7
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,540
<font color="yellow">They're filming this right now. Are you okay with that?</font>

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,460
<font color="yellow">From this point on, people will think it's real.</font>

9
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,350
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,980
<font color="yellow">Don't you see me?</font>

11
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,380
<font color="yellow">Think of what I did for you!</font>

12
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,060
<font color="yellow">Don't you see me?</font>

13
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,740
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,340
<font color="yellow">The weird girl who turned her back to me...</font>

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,620
<font color="yellow">won't even cast me a glance.</font>

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,660
<font color="yellow">Instead, she wants the guy who abandoned her.</font>

17
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,220
<font color="yellow">Don't listen to anyone else.</font>

18
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,060
<font color="yellow">Please just listen to me.</font>

19
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,420
<font color="yellow">I love you, Eul.</font>

20
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,260
<font color="yellow">I love you, Eul.</font>

21
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,940
<font color="yellow">I love you,</font>

22
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
<font color="yellow">Eul.</font>

23
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,316
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Yes?</font>

24
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:08,540
<font color="yellow">Is that Joon Young's house?</font>

25
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
<font color="yellow">Eul?</font>

26
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,340
<font color="yellow">I decided...</font>

27
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,180
<font color="yellow">to trust you just once.</font>

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

29
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

30
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
<font color="yellow">Are you listening?</font>

31
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,480
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear that. What did you say?</font>

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,140
<font color="yellow">- I decided to trust you...
-  No, don't say it.</font>

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
<font color="yellow">Say no more, Eul.</font>

34
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
<font color="yellow">I'll come right over. Say it to my face.</font>

35
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,500
<font color="yellow">Let's stay like this just for a minute.</font>

36
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,164
<font color="yellow">I don't like tripe. They're smelly.</font>

37
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:50,916
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

38
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,880
<font color="yellow">Our tripe is pre-cooked, so it doesn't smell. It's really savoury.</font>

39
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,920
<font color="yellow">You should try it.</font>

40
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, hey.</font>

41
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,770
<font color="yellow">Eul was waiting for you, but she left a while ago.</font>

42
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,930
<font color="yellow">- I came to see you, not Eul.
-  What?</font>

43
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,330
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

44
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,890
<font color="yellow">You came to see me?</font>

45
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,930
<font color="yellow">You should've told me. I didn't even shower today.</font>

46
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,170
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

47
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,170
<font color="yellow">What? A thousand dollars?</font>

48
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,540
<font color="yellow">I don't need this kind of money.</font>

49
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,940
<font color="yellow">I don't care if you're completely bankrupt.</font>

50
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,290
<font color="yellow">Please keep this...</font>

51
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,770
<font color="yellow">and count off whatever Eul has from that money.</font>

52
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,410
<font color="yellow">What? What are you saying?</font>

53
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,010
<font color="yellow">I won't ever come back here.</font>

54
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to see Eul from now on, either.</font>

55
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,810
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

56
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,090
<font color="yellow">it's been over a minute.</font>

57
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,650
<font color="yellow">Just one more minute.</font>

58
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,140
<font color="yellow">When did you get here?</font>

59
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,930
<font color="yellow">Just now.</font>

60
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,570
<font color="yellow">It's really late.</font>

61
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,330
<font color="yellow">Why? What's going on? How's your...</font>

62
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,050
<font color="yellow">Are we going to spend the night like this?</font>

63
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,730
<font color="yellow">- That'd be great for me.
-  My goodness.</font>

64
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,770
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you were going to say over the phone.</font>

65
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

66
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,140
<font color="yellow">I was saying...</font>

67
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,090
<font color="yellow">What I meant by trusting you is that...</font>

68
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,570
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not saying I'm really going to trust you.</font>

69
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,410
<font color="yellow">So what I'm saying is...</font>

70
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,290
<font color="yellow">I'm making a living off of you right now.</font>

71
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,650
<font color="yellow">And it'd be my loss to not trust you.</font>

72
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,380
<font color="yellow">- Why are you smiling?
-  Because you're so pretty.</font>

73
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,290
<font color="yellow">You're even prettier.</font>

74
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,260
<font color="yellow">You're so adorable.</font>

75
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,190
<font color="yellow">You'll hit me if I ask you for a kiss, right?</font>

76
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,260
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you.</font>

77
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,770
<font color="yellow">What a pervert.</font>

78
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,530
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow, Eul.</font>

79
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,610
<font color="yellow">And the day after tomorrow.</font>

80
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,970
<font color="yellow">And the day after that.</font>

81
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,810
<font color="yellow">And the day after that.</font>

82
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,900
<font color="yellow">I'll see you whenever and wherever.</font>

83
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,150
<font color="yellow">- Why is it so loud?
-  Pardon?</font>

84
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,190
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you going to control the scene?</font>

85
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,060
<font color="yellow">It's because of Joon Young and Yoo Na.</font>

86
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,880
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of reporters here.</font>

87
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

88
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,830
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
-  I'm sorry. Excuse me.</font>

89
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,950
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kim.</font>

90
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, Gook Young. Let us get his interview.</font>

91
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,390
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kim.</font>

92
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,290
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to set up an interview...</font>

93
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,250
<font color="yellow">with both Joon Young and Yoo Na...</font>

94
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,710
<font color="yellow">after they're done with the shooting.</font>

95
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,430
<font color="yellow">So could you all please wait a little?</font>

96
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,760
<font color="yellow">- I'm freezing right now.
-  I'm sorry.</font>

97
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,300
<font color="yellow">Also, we're in the middle of a shooting,</font>

98
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,430
<font color="yellow">so please keep it low. Thank you.</font>

99
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,000
<font color="yellow">Everyone, be quiet.</font>

100
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,390
<font color="yellow">- Please be quiet.
-  Let's begin.</font>

101
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,580
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  What's that?</font>

102
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,830
<font color="yellow">What's that? Hey.</font>

103
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,470
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's with the drone?</font>

104
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,830
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

105
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,070
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Go on and begin.</font>

106
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,110
<font color="yellow">Okay, let us begin.</font>

107
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,790
<font color="yellow">It's your first time being out in public...</font>

108
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,670
<font color="yellow">after you opened up about your relationship.</font>

109
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,510
<font color="yellow">Could you share a word?</font>

110
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,350
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry you had to come all the way here...</font>

111
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,990
<font color="yellow">just for us.</font>

112
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,160
<font color="yellow">We'll continue to cherish each other.</font>

113
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,190
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

114
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,030
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

115
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,390
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, what about you?</font>

116
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,350
<font color="yellow">Joon Young, say something.</font>

117
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,910
<font color="yellow">We're both...</font>

118
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,310
<font color="yellow">celebrities...</font>

119
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,030
<font color="yellow">and public figures.</font>

120
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,030
<font color="yellow">But before that,</font>

121
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,390
<font color="yellow">I believe we have...</font>

122
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,430
<font color="yellow">the rights to have our personal lives protected.</font>

123
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,590
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why...</font>

124
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,150
<font color="yellow">everyone has to gossip about my love life...</font>

125
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,350
<font color="yellow">and why the person I love...</font>

126
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,950
<font color="yellow">needs to be hated and receive unnecessary comments...</font>

127
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,510
<font color="yellow">when she did nothing wrong.</font>

128
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,190
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why...</font>

129
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,030
<font color="yellow">I have to be in this position.</font>

130
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,230
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit confused about this.</font>

131
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,430
<font color="yellow">This is all I have to say about this issue.</font>

132
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,430
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

133
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,630
<font color="yellow">I won't be doing any more interviews.</font>

134
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,600
<font color="yellow">If you still want me around as a celebrity,</font>

135
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,480
<font color="yellow">please refrain from showing too much interest...</font>

136
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,150
<font color="yellow">in my private life from now on.</font>

137
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,910
<font color="yellow">Joon Young. Hey, Joon Young.</font>

138
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,710
<font color="yellow">Producer Noh.</font>

139
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,370
<font color="yellow">You were stigmatised as a gold-digger...</font>

140
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,880
<font color="yellow">due to Joon Young's actions.</font>

141
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,390
<font color="yellow">Could you share a word?</font>

142
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,310
<font color="yellow">Please say something.</font>

143
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,830
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say.</font>

144
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,310
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's using Yoo Na as a shield.</font>

145
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,870
<font color="yellow">Joon Young might've agreed to his agency's plan...</font>

146
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,080
<font color="yellow">just so that he could protect you, Producer Noh.</font>

147
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,870
<font color="yellow">He may be fooling everyone again.</font>

148
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,570
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Don't you think you're crossing the line?</font>

149
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,150
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

150
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're wrong. I have someone else that I like.</font>

151
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,070
<font color="yellow">He's much cooler than Joon Young.</font>

152
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,710
<font color="yellow">Do you expect us to believe that?</font>

153
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Joon Young's a huge celebrity,</font>

154
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,720
<font color="yellow">but he's not my type.</font>

155
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,910

<font color="yellow">is sick.</font>

311
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,050
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about your bucket list?</font>

312
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,770
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

313
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,250
<font color="yellow">Could you tell me one item on that list?</font>

314
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,170
<font color="yellow">Hearing "You're just my type"...</font>

315
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,210
<font color="yellow">from the person who just questioned me.</font>

316
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,690
<font color="yellow">I'll edit that out.</font>

317
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,890
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you again.</font>

318
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,250
<font color="yellow">Tell me one of the items...</font>

319
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,810
<font color="yellow">Hearing "I love you" from the woman...</font>

320
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,410
<font color="yellow">standing in front of me.</font>

321
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,130
<font color="yellow">Stop joking around.</font>

322
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,690
<font color="yellow">I wasn't joking.</font>

323
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,610
<font color="yellow">Did you even wash your hair?</font>

324
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,030
<font color="yellow">How can you shoot the guy you like with oily hair?</font>

325
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,130
<font color="yellow">I did wash my hair.</font>

326
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,570
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

327
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,010
<font color="yellow">That means you do like me.</font>

328
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,210
<font color="yellow">You even washed your hair to impress me.</font>

329
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,850
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

330
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,110
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I didn't wash my hair.</font>

331
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,900
<font color="yellow">It's oily and smelly.</font>

332
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,010
<font color="yellow">Do you want to smell it? It's awful, right?</font>

333
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,610
<font color="yellow">Right, I haven't showered for a week, either.</font>

334
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,570
<font color="yellow">No wonder my body's been itching lately.</font>

335
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,370
<font color="yellow">I can even fart in front of you, Joon Young.</font>

336
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,620
<font color="yellow">Joon Young.</font>

337
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,290
<font color="yellow">We'll do the photo shoot soon, so please stand by.</font>

338
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,610
<font color="yellow">You should come along.</font>

339
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,250
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving for Seoul.</font>

340
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,830
<font color="yellow">He's been saying weird things. He must be tired.</font>

341
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,450
<font color="yellow">I don't think he has much to say today.</font>

342
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,530
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Is he sullen?</font>

343
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,820
<font color="yellow">My gosh. What a baby.</font>

344
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,380
<font color="yellow">Don't call him a baby.</font>

345
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,570
<font color="yellow">He's a top star in Korea.</font>

346
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,690
<font color="yellow">I'd say he's more like a child. I'll get going.</font>

347
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,010
<font color="yellow">(To Eul)</font>

348
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,750
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

349
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,090
<font color="yellow">Try being more intimate. That's nice.</font>

350
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,970
<font color="yellow">Wow, you two make a wonderful couple.</font>

351
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,530
<font color="yellow">It looks great.</font>

352
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,930
<font color="yellow">I guess we really do look great together.</font>

353
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,290
<font color="yellow">Shall we go out for real?</font>

354
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,770
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship with Producer Noh?</font>

355
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,730
<font color="yellow">I knew you had a unique taste,</font>

356
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,930
<font color="yellow">but she's a bit too low, don't you think?</font>

357
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,170
<font color="yellow">You're a top star, you know.</font>

358
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,650
<font color="yellow">Now, try to act...</font>

359
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,370
<font color="yellow">as if you're whispering your love to each other.</font>

360
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,730
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

361
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,220
<font color="yellow">Let's just focus on the shooting.</font>

362
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,250
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

363
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,250
<font color="yellow">What does she have that I don't?</font>

364
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you making me feel so awful?</font>

365
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,390
<font color="yellow">You started it.</font>

366
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,510
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

367
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,490
<font color="yellow">You did an interview to play along with the president.</font>

368
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,610
<font color="yellow">That looks great.</font>

369
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,170
<font color="yellow">Just take what you'd like out of this and leave.</font>

370
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,490
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful that you helped me protect Eul.</font>

371
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,090
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

372
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,050
<font color="yellow">Let's stop for a bit.</font>

373
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,490
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

374
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,370
<font color="yellow">Wait. Wait a second.</font>

375
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,610
<font color="yellow">Producer Noh, hurry up.</font>

376
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,410
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  What am I going to do?</font>

377
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,450
<font color="yellow">Joon Young just got hurt.</font>

378
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,570
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  The light stand fell on him.</font>

379
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,930
<font color="yellow">I hope he's not badly hurt.</font>

380
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,970
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

381
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,010
<font color="yellow">He's at the hospital.</font>

382
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,340
<font color="yellow">One of our managers is waiting in our van.</font>

383
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,330
<font color="yellow">I have to clear things up here,</font>

384
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,370
<font color="yellow">so could you please run over to him?</font>

385
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,970
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Please, hurry.</font>

386
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,410
<font color="yellow">Take good care of her. Don't speed too much.</font>

387
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,250
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

388
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,290
<font color="yellow">Is Joon Young...</font>

389
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,530
<font color="yellow">badly hurt?</font>

390
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,330
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

391
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,930
<font color="yellow">How bad is it?</font>

392
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,950
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure,</font>

393
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,610
<font color="yellow">but I heard that his life may be in danger.</font>

394
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,250
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

395
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you stop?</font>

396
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,990
<font color="yellow">I want to grab a cup of coffee.</font>

397
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

398
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,370
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

399
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,610
<font color="yellow">How can you think about getting coffee...</font>

400
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,460
<font color="yellow">when Joon Young's life is in danger?</font>

401
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,780
<font color="yellow">I'll only take five minutes.</font>

402
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,250
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

403
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,370
<font color="yellow">Just keep going.</font>

404
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,330
<font color="yellow">I have something to say to him.</font>

405
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,110
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go!</font>

406
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,030
<font color="yellow">It'll only take five minutes. I'll be right back.</font>

407
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,490
<font color="yellow">What kind of jerk are you?</font>

408
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,450
<font color="yellow">Get off right now.</font>

409
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,850
<font color="yellow">I'll drive.</font>

410
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,530
<font color="yellow">Give me the address to the hospital and leave.</font>

411
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,940
<font color="yellow">Get out of the car, you jerk! Get off!</font>

412
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,940
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

413
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,170
<font color="yellow">Were you that worried about me?</font>

414
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,460
<font color="yellow">What did you want to say to me?</font>

415
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,850
<font color="yellow">Did you want to confess your love...</font>

416
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,530
<font color="yellow">after hearing that I might die?</font>

417
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,460
<font color="yellow">- You jerk.
-  Hey.</font>

418
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,940
<font color="yellow">It wasn't completely a lie.</font>

419
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,770
<font color="yellow">I have a bump in my head.</font>

420
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,890
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

421
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you pretend you didn't care?</font>

422
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you pretend you didn't like me...</font>

423
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,650
<font color="yellow">when you were going to be this worried?</font>

424
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,850
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

425
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,980
<font color="yellow">Did you fall again?</font>

426
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,980
<font color="yellow">Why do you always fall down?</font>

427
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,850
<font color="yellow">Is your leg okay?</font>

428
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,980
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

429
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,690
<font color="yellow">- You...
-  What?</font>

430
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,770
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

431
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

432
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,210
<font color="yellow">My face got torn, and I have a bruise.</font>

433
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,420
<font color="yellow">The inside of my mouth is torn, too.</font>

434
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,290
<font color="yellow">It's also hard to move my shoulders.</font>

435
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,310
<font color="yellow">I wanted to go on a date before going to the hospital,</font>

436
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,670
<font color="yellow">but that's all ruined.</font>

437
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,650
<font color="yellow">The coffee over there is excellent, you know.</font>

438
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

439
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,460
<font color="yellow">You're my type.</font>

440
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,250
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

441
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,130
<font color="yellow">And yes.</font>

442
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,010
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

443
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,330
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now?</font>

444
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,370
<font color="yellow">You crazy fool.</font>

445
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,330
<font color="yellow">How can you go on a date...</font>

446
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,610
<font color="yellow">when you're this hurt?</font>

447
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,420
<font color="yellow">What a bunch of nonsense.</font>

448
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,370
<font color="yellow">How can you think about getting coffee?</font>

449
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,850
<font color="yellow">Dad, you're going to the K-Pop Festival today, right?</font>

450
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,850
<font color="yellow">Can you take me with you?</font>

451
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,420
<font color="yellow">Dad, come on. Take me, please?</font>

452
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,850
<font color="yellow">Can you stop the car?</font>

453
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,910
<font color="yellow">You were a high school student?</font>

454
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

455
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,310
<font color="yellow">Then does that mean I get fooled by a minor?</font>

456
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,130
<font color="yellow">- You little...
-  I never fooled you.</font>

457
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,570
<font color="yellow">You never asked if I was in high school.</font>

458
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,290
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

459
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,490
<font color="yellow">- Do you have money?
-  Why?</font>

460
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,570
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to rob me now?</font>

461
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,530
<font color="yellow">By the way, I'm older than you.</font>

462
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,890
<font color="yellow">You're a bold one.</font>

463
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,770
<font color="yellow">Watch your manners.</font>

464
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,670
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly.</font>

465
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,980
<font color="yellow">You'll get sick.</font>

466
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,030
<font color="yellow">Did you starve it for days?</font>

467
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,730
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't know. This isn't my cat.</font>

468
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,330
<font color="yellow">- Someone must've abandoned it.
-  Really?</font>

469
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,090
<font color="yellow">That's so sad.</font>

470
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,150
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  Please take care of this kitten.</font>

471
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,210
<font color="yellow">I have to go to school, so stay with...</font>

472
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,440
<font color="yellow">I mean, can you please look after it?</font>

473
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,670
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

474
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,730
<font color="yellow">Why would I take care of a stray cat?</font>

475
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,490
<font color="yellow">Because pretty people are usually nice.</font>

476
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,370
<font color="yellow">Your eyes</font>

477
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,170
<font color="yellow">Your touch</font>

478
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,830
<font color="yellow">Blow around me like the wind</font>

479
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,010
<font color="yellow">- It feels like
-  Be quiet.</font>

480
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,690
<font color="yellow">Stop singing that stupid song.</font>

481
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,090
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

482
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,980
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin.</font>

483
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,330
<font color="yellow">- This is bad.
-  Why? What is it?</font>

484
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,530
<font color="yellow">Joon Young... Joon Young is...</font>

485
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,250
<font color="yellow">- You have to come with me.
-  Why?</font>

486
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,130
<font color="yellow">Hey, go and get her jacket.</font>

487
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,330
<font color="yellow">- Hurry.
-  What?</font>

488
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,490
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  Just come along.</font>

489
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,490
<font color="yellow">- Please drop this.
-  What's with you?</font>

490
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,870
<font color="yellow">Why are we here?</font>

491
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,980
<font color="yellow">I thought he was hurt. Let's go to the hospital.</font>

492
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,490
<font color="yellow">We called the doctor here.</font>

493
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,670
<font color="yellow">Ms Shin, hurry up.</font>

494
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,090
<font color="yellow">You have to hurry. He's dying.</font>

495
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,310
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen. I knew it.</font>

496
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,850
<font color="yellow">You're a fraud.</font>

497
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,950
<font color="yellow">This wasn't my idea. It was Joon Young's.</font>

498
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,850
<font color="yellow">He seems to have had a lot of fun...</font>

499
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,670
<font color="yellow">when he fooled Producer Noh.</font>

500
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,130
<font color="yellow">Move. Move away.</font>

501
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,590
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go.</font>

502
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,050
<font color="yellow">- Can you grab her?
-  Okay.</font>

503
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,730
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing?</font>

504
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,010
<font color="yellow">The minister of culture and sports is giving awards...</font>

505
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,460
<font color="yellow">to mothers who brought up K-wave celebrities today.</font>

506
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

507
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,010
<font color="yellow">Why don't you give her a big hand?</font>

508
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,650
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

509
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,630
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

510
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,390
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty that everything looks great on you.</font>

511
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,090
<font color="yellow">I can't pick one. I'll just take everything.</font>

512
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

513
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,010
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not going to buy them, so don't bother.</font>

514
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,130
<font color="yellow">Just ignore her.</font>

515
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,340
<font color="yellow">You must feel like we're on good terms...</font>

516
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,460
<font color="yellow">just because I let you by a couple of times.</font>

517
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,700
<font color="yellow">Politicians will be there with their families today.</font>

518
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,350
<font color="yellow">Ministers will be there...</font>

519
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,980
<font color="yellow">and so will congressmen.</font>

520
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,070
<font color="yellow">I heard Congressman Choi is coming, right?</font>

521
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,490
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

522
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,590
<font color="yellow">People in Africa sing my songs,</font>

523
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,470
<font color="yellow">and people in Brazil cry over my dramas.</font>

524
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,820
<font color="yellow">Isn't this enough...</font>

525
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,170
<font color="yellow">for you to be proud of your son?</font>

526
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,610
<font color="yellow">How do I look?</font>

527
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, people say the tailor makes the man.</font>

528
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,090
<font color="yellow">Are you really my twin brother, Jeong Sik?</font>

529
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,210
<font color="yellow">You should hold your tummy in, Dad.</font>

530
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,090
<font color="yellow">- Is that good?
-  Excellent.</font>

531
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,290
<font color="yellow">Will Ms Shin be on TV, too?</font>

532
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,130
<font color="yellow">- I'm not sure.
-  Joon Young sent...</font>

533
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,650
<font color="yellow">a tuxedo for you...</font>

534
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,890
<font color="yellow">to accompany her.</font>

535
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,610
<font color="yellow">Maybe he thinks of you like a father.</font>

536
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,570
<font color="yellow">What... What are you talking about?</font>

537
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,610
<font color="yellow">He's asking me to accompany her because...</font>

538
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,420
<font color="yellow">she'd feel awkward sitting alone.</font>

539
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,870
<font color="yellow">I'm a handsome man, you know.</font>

540
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,710
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll ask you questions like a reporter.</font>

541
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,810
<font color="yellow">Try to answer them.</font>

542
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,610
<font color="yellow">I heard you've been...</font>

543
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,770
<font color="yellow">acquainted with Joon Young...</font>

544
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,540
<font color="yellow">and his mother for a long time.</font>

545
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,850
<font color="yellow">Could you say something about his mother?</font>

546
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,170
<font color="yellow">Joon Young's mum is...</font>

547
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,390
<font color="yellow">much like Mencius's mother.</font>

548
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,530
<font color="yellow">To make Joon Young a world-renowned star,</font>

549
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,330
<font color="yellow">she... Well...</font>

550
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,210
<font color="yellow">- What did she do?
-  Nothing.</font>

551
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,570
<font color="yellow">To be honest, she was only mean to him...</font>

552
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,150
<font color="yellow">saying that he's not her son.</font>

553
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,310
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, more radish kimchi, please.</font>

554
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,330
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

555
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,530
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

556
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,210
<font color="yellow">What's he saying? I can't hear anything.</font>

557
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,370
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's a technical problem.</font>

558
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,690
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

559
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,530
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

560
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,330
<font color="yellow">Where else would I be?</font>

561
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,110
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to the K-Pop Festival?</font>

562
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,590
<font color="yellow">His manager called me and told me not to come.</font>

563
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,890
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

564
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,860
<font color="yellow">His mum is receiving an award from the minister.</font>

565
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,890
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go.</font>

566
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,790
<font color="yellow">You'll have a lot to put on camera.</font>

567
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,810
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

568
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,690
<font color="yellow">he told me over and over again not to come.</font>

569
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,950
<font color="yellow">We're not a PR agency that makes their PR videos.</font>

570
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,970
<font color="yellow">Get up and go.</font>

571
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,090
<font color="yellow">At least brush your teeth before you leave.</font>

572
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,170
<font color="yellow">Over here, please.</font>

573
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,090
<font color="yellow">Over here, please.</font>

574
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:39,930
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

575
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,650
<font color="yellow">(My number one treasure)</font>

576
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jik.</font>

577
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,710
<font color="yellow">When are you coming home?</font>

578
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,690
<font color="yellow">I have an urgent shooting. I'll be late.</font>

579
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,650
<font color="yellow">- Why? Is something wrong?
-  No, I just called.</font>

580
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,730
<font color="yellow">Will you be very late?</font>

581
00:47:58,850 --> 00:47:59,950
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

582
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,810
<font color="yellow">Make sure you eat something, okay?</font>

583
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,290
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

584
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,410
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what day it is today?</font>

585
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,010
<font color="yellow">What day is it?</font>

586
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,380
<font color="yellow">It's not Jik's birthday,</font>

587
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,610
<font color="yellow">and it's not your birthday, either.</font>

588
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,370
<font color="yellow">It's the anniversary of your father's death, you fool.</font>

589
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,830
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what's so important...</font>

590
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,570
<font color="yellow">that you'd forget about today.</font>

591
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,530
<font color="yellow">Give it to me, Na Ri.</font>

592
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Dad will understand that you're busy.</font>

593
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,090
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

594
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,020
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

595
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,490
<font color="yellow">You have to make a living...</font>

596
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,310
<font color="yellow">before you remember a day like this.</font>

597
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,740
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of everything here, so don't worry.</font>

598
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,730
<font color="yellow">Just make some time to come and say your prayers, okay?</font>

599
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,570
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

600
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,010
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me, Eul?</font>

601
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,250
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

602
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,010
<font color="yellow">Did she hang up?</font>

603
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,490
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll just have to do it on your own.</font>

604
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,290
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I can do it alone.</font>

605
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,050
<font color="yellow">You're such a grown up.</font>

606
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,460
<font color="yellow">How can you two be...</font>

607
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,930
<font color="yellow">so different?</font>

608
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,250
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for a call?</font>

609
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,010
<font color="yellow">You've been looking at your phone all day.</font>

610
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,050
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting for Hyun Woo.</font>

611
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,210
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

612
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,340
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he calling?</font>

613
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,170
<font color="yellow">He always came on your dad's memorial day.</font>

614
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,530
<font color="yellow">You should give him a call.</font>

615
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,730
<font color="yellow">The number doesn't exist any more.</font>

616
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,970
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  I've been calling him,</font>

617
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,290
<font color="yellow">but it says the number doesn't exist any more.</font>

618
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,810
<font color="yellow">I hope nothing happened to him.</font>

619
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,290
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring Ha Ru along?</font>

620
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,010
<font color="yellow">Dad asked me to come along because he thought...</font>

621
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,850
<font color="yellow">I needed a break from my studies.</font>

622
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,810
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to eat good food...</font>

623
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,130
<font color="yellow">and relieve my stress by watching celebrities perform.</font>

624
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,930
<font color="yellow">Right, Dad?</font>

625
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,770
<font color="yellow">She's right.</font>

626
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,170
<font color="yellow">Please let her off just for today.</font>

627
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,230
<font color="yellow">Will there be celebrities there?</font>

628
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,450
<font color="yellow">Yes. Didn't I tell you?</font>

629
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,610
<font color="yellow">Like who?</font>

630
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,610
<font color="yellow">You don't even watch TV. How would you know?</font>

631
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,370
<font color="yellow">I don't know most of them, either.</font>

632
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,170
<font color="yellow">I rarely watch TV.</font>

633
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,570
<font color="yellow">Will Shin Joon Young be there?</font>

634
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,850
<font color="yellow">How do you know him?</font>

635
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,450
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dad. Everyone knows who he is.</font>

636
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,930
<font color="yellow">That's what my friends say.</font>

637
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,880
<font color="yellow">My friends were surprised that I didn't know him.</font>

638
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,290
<font color="yellow">Will he be there?</font>

639
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,850
<font color="yellow">- No.
-  No.</font>

640
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,610
<font color="yellow">He's on an overseas tour.</font>

641
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,050
<font color="yellow">My friend's a fan of his,</font>

642
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,650
<font color="yellow">so she told me.</font>

643
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,830
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you his fan, too?</font>

644
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,140
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

645
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,570
<font color="yellow">But I wanted to see him, though. That's too bad.</font>

646
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,790
<font color="yellow">You can take Ha Ru home.</font>

647
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,250
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
-  Why?</font>

648
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,010
<font color="yellow">She's already here. Let's go in together.</font>

649
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,890
<font color="yellow">I heard today's a very important occasion.</font>

650
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,770
<font color="yellow">People would think she's not studying for college...</font>

651
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,510
<font color="yellow">if they see her here.</font>

652
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,310
<font color="yellow">Why bother caring about what others would think?</font>

653
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,330
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

654
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,710
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru, go home. Okay?</font>

655
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,770
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't even get to see Joon Young.</font>

656
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,930
<font color="yellow">I can't leave like this.</font>

657
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,530
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Hey! Stop!</font>

658
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:48,890
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

659
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,170
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

660
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,890
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru, leave the cat and come here.</font>

661
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,930
<font color="yellow">Is Shin Joon Young here?</font>

662
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, I heard he is.</font>

663
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,610
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie, then?</font>

664
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,730
<font color="yellow">I was afraid you'd send Ha Ru back.</font>

665
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,130
<font color="yellow">You already know that she's his fan.</font>

666
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,790
<font color="yellow">Like she said,</font>

667
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,740
<font color="yellow">she's too busy following him to get into trouble,</font>

668
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,330
<font color="yellow">so let's be thankful about that.</font>

669
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,930
<font color="yellow">Come here. Let's go.</font>

670
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,410
<font color="yellow">Dad. I'm sorry.</font>

671
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,650
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

672
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,690
<font color="yellow">I said, go away.</font>

673
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,730
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

674
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,130
<font color="yellow">Do you know whose this is? It's my Dad's.</font>

675
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting my cat?</font>

676
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,890
<font color="yellow">It's the gold-digger.</font>

677
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,210
<font color="yellow">Is that your cat?</font>

678
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,890
<font color="yellow">Do you see this?</font>

679
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,390
<font color="yellow">You should train...</font>

680
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,570
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for it.</font>

681
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,290
<font color="yellow">I can pay for that.</font>

682
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,010
<font color="yellow">It won't cost much anyway.</font>

683
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,170
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

684
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,450
<font color="yellow">Here. Are we cool?</font>

685
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,690
<font color="yellow">- You little...
-  Ouch.</font>

686
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,450
<font color="yellow">- Why did you hit me?
-  How old are you?</font>

687
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:50,570
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn your manners?</font>

688
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,050
<font color="yellow">Didn't you learn to apologise for your mistakes?</font>

689
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,210
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru.</font>

690
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,450
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

691
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,090
<font color="yellow">She just hit me.</font>

692
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,370
<font color="yellow">Did my daughter do something to you?</font>

693
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,090
<font color="yellow">Did my car do something to you?</font>

694
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,410
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

695
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,300
<font color="yellow">What did you do wrong?</font>

696
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,810
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

697
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,090
<font color="yellow">She just hit me for no reason while I was passing by.</font>

698
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,050
<font color="yellow">Did you hit her?</font>

699
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,850
<font color="yellow">Don't you...</font>

700
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,690
<font color="yellow">remember me?</font>

701
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,810
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

702
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,530
<font color="yellow">She's a gold-digger.</font>

703
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,100
<font color="yellow">She tried to get Joon Young, but her face got revealed,</font>

704
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,570
<font color="yellow">so she failed before she could do anything.</font>

705
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,690
<font color="yellow">Ha Ru.</font>

706
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,450
<font color="yellow">Did she do this?</font>

707
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,070
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

708
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,410
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me. It was the kitten.</font>

709
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,010
<font color="yellow">But it doesn't know any better. It's just a kitten.</font>

710
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,930
<font color="yellow">Today's my father's memorial day.</font>

711
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,610
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

712
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:45,570
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

713
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.</font>

714
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,210
<font color="yellow">So don't be mad and take this.</font>

715
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving her 50 dollars?</font>

716
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,970
<font color="yellow">- This all costs less than three dollars.
-  Ha Ru.</font>

717
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,450
<font color="yellow">Here. Go on and take it.</font>

718
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,530
<font color="yellow">You should apologise first.</font>

719
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,370
<font color="yellow">Instead of giving her money,</font>

720
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,410
<font color="yellow">you should apologise first.</font>
