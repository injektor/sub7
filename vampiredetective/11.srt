<font color="yellow">Then let's end it here.</font>

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,690
<font color="yellow">With this gun,</font>

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,020
<font color="yellow">Cho Myung Geun, you...</font>

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,690
<font color="yellow">and I...</font>

5
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,060
<font color="yellow">will all lose.</font>

6
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,190
<font color="yellow">Do you really think so?</font>

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,990
<font color="yellow">Cho Myung Geun ran away from the company knowing all the secrets.</font>

8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,960
<font color="yellow">If you don't get rid of him,</font>

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,220
<font color="yellow">the organisation will collapse.</font>

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,560
<font color="yellow">I'm holding the key.</font>

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,360
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that?</font>

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="yellow">Do you have the nerve to pull that trigger?</font>

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,260
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,190
<font color="yellow">We'll see.</font>

15
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,160
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Woo.</font>

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,720
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Woo.</font>

17
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,620
<font color="yellow">Kang Tae Woo.</font>

18
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,420
<font color="yellow">Especially in choosing a woman.</font>

19
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,060

<font color="yellow">Protect Yu Jin.</font>

21
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,190
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

22
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,090
<font color="yellow">too late to go back now.</font>

23
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,990
<font color="yellow">You need to get used to it.</font>

24
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,890
<font color="yellow">Drink it.</font>

25
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,590
<font color="yellow">It's a lot harder than...</font>

26
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,220
<font color="yellow">you thought, right?</font>

27
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,960
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

28
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
<font color="yellow">You're not...</font>

29
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,390
<font color="yellow">regretting it already, are you?</font>

30
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,130
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

31
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,390
<font color="yellow">I like it so much.</font>

32
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,590
<font color="yellow">Now that I gave you what you wanted,</font>

33
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,990
<font color="yellow">let's finish talking about Cho Myung Geun.</font>

34
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,420
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

35
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,690
<font color="yellow">There is a problem that we have to solve first.</font>

36
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
<font color="yellow">A problem?</font>

37
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,420
<font color="yellow">Jung Yu Jin.</font>

<font color="yellow">Tae Woo.</font>

40
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,790
<font color="yellow">We're in trouble. I think they know who we are.</font>

41
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,820
<font color="yellow">Untie me.</font>

42
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,990
<font color="yellow">I think we should get out of here.</font>

43
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,490
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry up and go.</font>

44
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,420
<font color="yellow">We have to go now.</font>

45
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,560
<font color="yellow">- I'm not going.
-  What?</font>

46
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,320
<font color="yellow">I won't let you go, either.</font>

47
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,090
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

48
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,120
<font color="yellow">it's too late to go back now.</font>

49
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,410
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

50
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,460
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin.</font>

51
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,120
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

52
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,760
<font color="yellow">You look strange.</font>

53
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,160
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

54
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
<font color="yellow">I've changed.</font>

55
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

56
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,920
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

57
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,260
<font color="yellow">Challenger.</font>

58
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,320
<font color="yellow">This is the real secret that they've been hiding.</font>

59
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,190
<font color="yellow">They already know who we are.</font>

60
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,260
<font color="yellow">What we can choose is...</font>

61
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,990
<font color="yellow">to die now...</font>

62
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
<font color="yellow">or to die later.</font>

63
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,590
<font color="yellow">That's the only choices we have.</font>

64
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,800
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what you're talking about.</font>

65
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,990
<font color="yellow">And now,</font>

66
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,490
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do a test...</font>

67
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,760
<font color="yellow">in order to save you.</font>

68
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,220
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

69
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,710
<font color="yellow">It looks like we can't issue a warranty right now.</font>

70
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,970
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to sit back and watch?</font>

71
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,080
<font color="yellow">Let's wait.</font>

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,860
<font color="yellow">- How much longer? After they die?
-  Hey!</font>

73
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,790
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue.</font>

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="yellow">Tae Woo.</font>

75
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,980
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Hey!</font>

76
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,790
<font color="yellow">- Hey! What are you doing?
-  Hello. Is Yu Jin all right?</font>

77

<font color="yellow">San.</font>

78
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,740
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time. Listen to me carefully.</font>

79
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,640
<font color="yellow">We found out where Cho Myung Geun is hiding.</font>

80
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,660
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

81
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,990
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

82
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,090
<font color="yellow">- they captured Yu Jin.
-  What?</font>

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,970
<font color="yellow">I'll go and save Yu Jin.</font>

84
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,320
<font color="yellow">You should catch Cho Myung Geun.</font>

85
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,720
<font color="yellow">I'll send you the address.</font>

86
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,560
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

87
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,190
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

88
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,960
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do?</font>

89
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
<font color="yellow">Everything is up to San now.</font>

90
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,260
<font color="yellow">He will either come to rescue you...</font>

91
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,590
<font color="yellow">or go to catch Cho Myung Geun.</font>

92
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,400
<font color="yellow">What difference does it make?</font>

93
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,420
<font color="yellow">If he goes to catch Cho Myung Geun,</font>

94
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,690
<font color="yellow">he will die with honour.</font>

95
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,620
<font color="yellow">If he comes to rescue you,</font>

96
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,690
<font color="yellow">I will kill him.</font>

97
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,420
<font color="yellow">Tae Woo.</font>

98
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,990
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

99
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,960
<font color="yellow">You're mine now.</font>

100
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,390
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

101
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,590
<font color="yellow">let me kill San.</font>

102
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,620
<font color="yellow">If you kill him,</font>

103
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,790
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to see you.</font>

104
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

105
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,730
<font color="yellow">Then promise me one thing.</font>

106
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,320
<font color="yellow">Promise me...</font>

107
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,230
<font color="yellow">that you'll become one of us.</font>

108
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,920
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

109
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,770
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy?
-  I have to go.</font>

110
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,350
<font color="yellow">Those two are discovered.</font>

111
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,860
<font color="yellow">If they find out about you, what happens to our mission?</font>

112
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,420
<font color="yellow">We're detectives.</font>

113
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,960
<font color="yellow">Our mission comes first. Follow orders.</font>

114
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,460
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
-  No.</font>

115
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,820
<font color="yellow">Goo Hyung.</font>

116
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,390
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

117
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,640
<font color="yellow">I promised Yu Jin that I'll protect her.</font>

118
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,730
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

119
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,560
<font color="yellow">You're following us, right?</font>

120
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,370
<font color="yellow">We'll take a right turn after about 2km.</font>

121
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,590
<font color="yellow">Check again when the backup force will be here.</font>

122
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,200
<font color="yellow">As I said, be careful. I have a bad feeling about this.</font>

123
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,290
<font color="yellow">Check your equipment again.</font>

124
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,190
<font color="yellow">Check your equipment again.</font>

125
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,560
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you look really tense.</font>

126
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,490
<font color="yellow">I have to be. We must catch him today.</font>

127
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,620
<font color="yellow">This will be our last chance.</font>

128
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,690
<font color="yellow">I don't feel good about this.</font>

129
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,520
<font color="yellow">No matter what happens,</font>

130
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,420
<font color="yellow">we should trust and protect each other, okay?</font>

131
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,790
<font color="yellow">Wear it at all times.</font>

132
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,220
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

133
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,620
<font color="yellow">This is totally a rural area. I don't think we can find him here.</font>

134
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,480
<font color="yellow">Don't act hastily. Stay sharp.</font>

135
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,620
<font color="yellow">He may not be alone.</font>

136
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,360
<font color="yellow">Four of you, follow me. The rest will go from the back, okay?</font>

137
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,670
<font color="yellow">San.</font>

138

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

141
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,190
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

142
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,260
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

143
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,320
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, I think we need to hurry. Let's go.</font>

144
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry.</font>

146
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,320
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, we'll get out of here. Don't worry.</font>

147
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
<font color="yellow">It's okay now.</font>

148
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,490
<font color="yellow">San, get on!</font>

149
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,590
<font color="yellow">Get them!</font>

150
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
<font color="yellow">Isn't that...</font>

151
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,920
<font color="yellow">Isn't that someone's jacket?</font>

152
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,920
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, are you all right?</font>

153
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,520
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm fine.</font>

154

<font color="yellow">- What about you?
-  I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry.</font>

155
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,690
<font color="yellow">We'll be reprimanded.</font>

156
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,920
<font color="yellow">We ruined the mission.</font>

157
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,790
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We'll just quit if we have to.</font>

158
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I feel really sick.</font>

159
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,790

162
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,560

163
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,690
<font color="yellow">What you did today...</font>

164
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,530
<font color="yellow">was too dangerous.</font>

165
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,860
<font color="yellow">I did it to protect you.</font>

166
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,060
<font color="yellow">- It's cold. Let's go to...
-  No.</font>

167
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,290
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

168
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,620
<font color="yellow">keep this on for now. I'll get you a blanket.</font>

169
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,890
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

170

172
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620

173
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,820

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,320
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

178
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,240
<font color="yellow">It's been days. Just a spoon, please?</font>

179
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,220
<font color="yellow">You need to get better.</font>

180
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

181
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,450
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

182
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,250
<font color="yellow">You disgust me.</font>

183
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you care.</font>

184
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,650
<font color="yellow">Just leave me alone.</font>

185
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,950
<font color="yellow">Drink a little bit at a time.</font>

186
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,590
<font color="yellow">If you drink a lot at once, you might get disgusted.</font>

187
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,390
<font color="yellow">I don't need it.</font>

188
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
<font color="yellow">Take it away.</font>

189
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
<font color="yellow">It's hard, isn't it?</font>

190
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,850
<font color="yellow">That's how it is in the beginning.</font>

191
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,020
<font color="yellow">You become sensitive...</font>

192
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,050
<font color="yellow">and sharp.</font>

193
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,120
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

194
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,720
<font color="yellow">I'll protect you.</font>

195
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

196
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,890
<font color="yellow">I didn't let you kill San.</font>

197
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,920
<font color="yellow">He died anyway.</font>

198
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,020
<font color="yellow">I'm here with you.</font>

199
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,190
<font color="yellow">You'd better get used to it.</font>

200
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,090
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, you know what?</font>

201
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,740
<font color="yellow">When you're reading a book or focusing on something,</font>

202
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,920
<font color="yellow">you're really pretty.</font>

203
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,980
<font color="yellow">- You know what?
-  What?</font>

204
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,300
<font color="yellow">You said the same thing when you asked me out for the first time.</font>

205
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,810
<font color="yellow">- Did I?
-  Yes. Who else did you say that to?</font>

206
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,720
<font color="yellow">Who else would I say it to? I'm just a little embarrassed.</font>

207
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,950
<font color="yellow">Are you really quitting?</font>

208
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,290
<font color="yellow">Someone should take the responsibility. Two of us died.</font>

209
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,520
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to be the one?</font>

210
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,020
<font color="yellow">It's my fault, too.</font>

211
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,820
<font color="yellow">Let's have a drink sometime.</font>

212
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

213
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,750
<font color="yellow">Do you miss...</font>

215
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,850

217

<font color="yellow">Things like this...</font>

218
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,720
<font color="yellow">don't suit you any more.</font>

219
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,680
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting here all lonely?</font>

220
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,750
<font color="yellow">How did you come here?</font>

221
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,050
<font color="yellow">How? I walked here.</font>

222
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,320
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing at me? You just laughed, right?</font>

223
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,820
<font color="yellow">I saw you laughing a little.</font>

224
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,040

228
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,490

<font color="yellow">You're laughing at me.</font>

238
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,600
<font color="yellow">It was hard to suggest you to do this together.</font>

239

315
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,150
<font color="yellow">I didn't kill him yet.</font>

316
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,520
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch a hair on him.</font>

317
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,020
<font color="yellow">If you do, you'll regret it.</font>

318
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,390
<font color="yellow">I'll let him go peacefully if you give me what I want.</font>

319
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

320
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,620
<font color="yellow">I've raised a tiger.</font>

321
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,120
<font color="yellow">That tiger...</font>

322
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,250
<font color="yellow">is losing his patience.</font>

323
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,520
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

324
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,320
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

325
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,160
<font color="yellow">- Cut him.
-  Yes, Sir.</font>

326
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,050
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you time.</font>

327
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,290
<font color="yellow">How long do you think it'll take for all the blood to drain?</font>

328
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,320
<font color="yellow">A day? Maybe two?</font>

329
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,320
<font color="yellow">Get me the list before then.</font>

330
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,990
<font color="yellow">I'll...</font>

331
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,220
<font color="yellow">make a promise.</font>

332
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,320
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong with him...</font>

333
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,720
<font color="yellow">by the time I return,</font>

334
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,320
<font color="yellow">I'll...</font>

335
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,950
<font color="yellow">rip Yu Jin apart in front of you.</font>

336
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,380
<font color="yellow">- Get him.
-  San.</font>

337
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,540
<font color="yellow">- Pull.
-  Get him.</font>

338
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,780
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  That's good.</font>

339
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,940
<font color="yellow">- Hold him.
-  He got it.</font>

340
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
<font color="yellow">- Roll.
-  Go.</font>

341
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,210
<font color="yellow">- Go.
-  Do it.</font>

342
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,390
<font color="yellow">- Go!
-  You can do it.</font>

343
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,320
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

344
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,290
<font color="yellow">- Nice.
-  Good one.</font>

345
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, Kang Tae Woo.</font>

346
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,320
<font color="yellow">San, are you all right?</font>

347
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,890
<font color="yellow">Hey. I'll put up a better fight next time.</font>

348
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,020
<font color="yellow">Please, I'm begging you. I'm sick of beating you.</font>

349
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,680
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

350
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,460
<font color="yellow">You should beat him in track and field next time.</font>

351
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,380
<font color="yellow">- He'll lose right away then.
-  Fine.</font>

352
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,590
<font color="yellow">You two just can't stop making fun of me.</font>

353
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,520
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

354
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,840
<font color="yellow">San, be careful.</font>

355
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,460
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of her.</font>

356
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,490
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

357
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,420
<font color="yellow">San, get on!</font>

358
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,320
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin!</font>

359
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,820
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin!</font>

360
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,490
<font color="yellow">It's Tae Woo for certain.</font>

361
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,220
<font color="yellow">I heard his voice.</font>

362
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,690
<font color="yellow">You said you couldn't find him when you searched.</font>

363
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,620
<font color="yellow">- It might not be him.
-  No.</font>

364
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,190
<font color="yellow">They're both alive.</font>

365
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,790
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's assume they are.</font>

366
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

367
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,320
<font color="yellow">You don't even know where to start.</font>

368
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,920
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

369
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,020
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

370
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,720
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

371
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,490
<font color="yellow">help my brother.</font>

372
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,850
<font color="yellow">What on earth is going on?</font>

373
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,050
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to grasp it.</font>

374
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,820
<font color="yellow">Who are you anyway?</font>

375
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,900
<font color="yellow">You really have an exquisite taste.</font>

376
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,790
<font color="yellow">It won't do you any good to sneak around here.</font>

377
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,090
<font color="yellow">I left something really important...</font>

378
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,090
<font color="yellow">with you.</font>

379
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,950
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

380
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,420
<font color="yellow">It'll be the key that will...</font>

381
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,950
<font color="yellow">save both you and me.</font>

382
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,200
<font color="yellow">Also Yu Jin.</font>

383
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,420
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

384
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,490
<font color="yellow">Like I said,</font>

385
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,120
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin came back from the dead.</font>

386
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,450
<font color="yellow">You must already know...</font>

387
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,890
<font color="yellow">what that means.</font>

388
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,290
<font color="yellow">What did you leave with us?</font>

389
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
<font color="yellow">The helper list.</font>

390
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,320
<font color="yellow">- Goo Hyung.
-  Yes?</font>

391
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
<font color="yellow">Check this out.</font>

392
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,450
<font color="yellow">Helper?</font>

393
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
<font color="yellow">The helper list?</font>

394
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,050
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the list from the club?</font>

395
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,290
<font color="yellow">You have it, right?</font>

396
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,750
<font color="yellow">You have one hour.</font>

397
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,120
<font color="yellow">Bring it to me.</font>

398
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,550
<font color="yellow">If you do,</font>

399
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,920
<font color="yellow">I'll let you see Yu Jin.</font>

400
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,790
<font color="yellow">Han Gyeo Wool.</font>

401
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,820
<font color="yellow">You look a lot like Han Gyu Min.</font>

402
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,120
<font color="yellow">You know my brother?</font>

403
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,660
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

404
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,790
<font color="yellow">We were...</font>

405
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,320
<font color="yellow">very special to each other.</font>

406
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,230
<font color="yellow">- Where is it?
-  I don't have it.</font>

407
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,630
<font color="yellow">- I don't have such a thing.
-  Goo Hyung.</font>

408
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,970
<font color="yellow">I won't give it to you even if I have it.</font>

409
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,680
<font color="yellow">- Don't speak a word.
-  The car Yu Jin was in...</font>

410
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,610
<font color="yellow">exploded in front of me,</font>

411
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,810
<font color="yellow">but they say she's still alive.</font>

412
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,840
<font color="yellow">I have to see her.</font>

413
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,470
<font color="yellow">I have to find out...</font>

414
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,340
<font color="yellow">what happened to her.</font>

415
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,570
<font color="yellow">- San.
-  Goo Hyung.</font>

416
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,470
<font color="yellow">Who is the woman just walked out?</font>

417
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,500
<font color="yellow">Did you drink? What are you talking about?</font>

418
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,810
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

419
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,110
<font color="yellow">She fooled us as Moon Mee Jin, right?</font>

420
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,410
<font color="yellow">Why would she come here? Are you crazy?</font>

421
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,840
<font color="yellow">Then who is the woman?</font>

422
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,810
<font color="yellow">A client.</font>

423
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,600
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, they look alike.</font>

424
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,610
<font color="yellow">Their height, hair colour and everything...</font>

425
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,010
<font color="yellow">What did she ask for?</font>

426
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,110
<font color="yellow">What do you think it is?</font>

427
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,950
<font color="yellow">She's having an affair, but her lover is...</font>

428
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,180
<font color="yellow">having another affair. She wants photo evidence.</font>

429
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,880
<font color="yellow">Why do we always get such lowbrow cases?</font>

430
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,660
<font color="yellow">We should get to it since we're on it.</font>

431
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,860
<font color="yellow">She looked like she is mean. Hey, Gyeo Wool.</font>

432
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,710
<font color="yellow">Can you get me a USB flash drive?</font>

433
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,100
<font color="yellow">- A USB flash drive?
-  Yes.</font>

434
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,130
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

435
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,710
<font color="yellow">We have to send it to the client.</font>

436
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,310
<font color="yellow">With the evidence of the adultery.</font>

437
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,210
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

438
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,810
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

439
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,180
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good night.</font>

440
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,240
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm the new lodger.</font>

441
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,940
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
-  Hello.</font>

442
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,840
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of you until the end.</font>

443
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,840
<font color="yellow">Really? You said until the end.</font>

444
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,790
<font color="yellow">It means forever.</font>

445
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,870
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

446
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,340
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

447
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,910
<font color="yellow">You make my life so fun. Let's go.</font>

448
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,180
<font color="yellow">- Goo Hyung.
-  Yes?</font>

449
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,240
<font color="yellow">Let's be prepared.</font>

450
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,680
<font color="yellow">Right. It can be dangerous. You've grown up.</font>

451
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,940
<font color="yellow">I'll bring them now.</font>

452
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,670
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

453
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,440
<font color="yellow">this is the end for us.</font>

454
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

455
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,970
<font color="yellow">You called me sooner than I expected.</font>

456
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,640
<font color="yellow">Were you scared?</font>

457
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,510
<font color="yellow">He's still...</font>

458
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,840
<font color="yellow">alive, right?</font>

459
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,910
<font color="yellow">You're playing it cool.</font>

460
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you don't have enough time for that.</font>

461
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,740
<font color="yellow">Joo Young Gwang.</font>

462
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,040
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

463
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,340
<font color="yellow">Let me see it first.</font>

464
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,110
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

465
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,710
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

466
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,970
<font color="yellow">Hey. Is this how much Joo Young Gwang means to you?</font>

467
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,640
<font color="yellow">What's up with that face?</font>

468
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,570
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know?</font>

469
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,670
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

470
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,170
<font color="yellow">Those guarding Jung Yu Jin were attacked.</font>

471
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,210
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

472
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,870
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

473
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,870
<font color="yellow">- Where did San go?
-  How should I know?</font>

474
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,740
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's meeting a client.</font>

475
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, the adulterer.</font>

476
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,170
<font color="yellow">Do you mean here?</font>

477
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,710
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

478
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,970
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

479
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,610
<font color="yellow">The USB flash drive that San took.</font>

480
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,670
<font color="yellow">I put a locating device on it.</font>

481
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,070
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

482
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,340
<font color="yellow">You didn't think I would lend it to him so easily, did you?</font>

483
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,160
<font color="yellow">That's not how I do it.</font>

484
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,810
<font color="yellow">Hey. Be honest.</font>

485
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,750
<font color="yellow">Did you put any tricks here?</font>

486
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,440
<font color="yellow">- I did.
-  What?</font>

487
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,140
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have left me out.</font>

488
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,040
<font color="yellow">Do you realise how important this is?</font>

489
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,570
<font color="yellow">I don't. You should have told me if it's that important.</font>

490
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's driving me crazy.</font>

491
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,310
<font color="yellow">She was here, wasn't she?</font>

492
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,110
<font color="yellow">- I'm asking if she was here.
-  Be quiet!</font>

493
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,640
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

494
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,940
<font color="yellow">I can't stay with you.</font>

495
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,310
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

496
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,310
<font color="yellow">- You shouldn't be here.
-  Yu Jin.</font>

497
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,310
<font color="yellow">You saw me die.</font>

498
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,570
<font color="yellow">- Think of me as a dead person.
-  Yu Jin, don't do this.</font>

499
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,510
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

500
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,010
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, we don't have time. Let's go.</font>

501
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,040
<font color="yellow">We can't run away from this.</font>

502
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,340
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin, are you all right?</font>

503
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,310
<font color="yellow">What's your plan?</font>

504
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,640
<font color="yellow">There must be a way.</font>

505
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,770
<font color="yellow">Tae Woo will come after us.</font>

506
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,440
<font color="yellow">I can't let you go.</font>

507
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,340
<font color="yellow">Gyeo Wool, can you check on the last location?</font>

508
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,640
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming, too.
-  No, stay here.</font>

509
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,210
<font color="yellow">- No, I want to come.
-  I said stay here!</font>

510
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:55,710
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous.</font>

511
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,070
<font color="yellow">I can't stay here by myself.</font>

512
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,240
<font color="yellow">Gyeo Wool, please.</font>

513
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,240
<font color="yellow">I'll call you if something happens.</font>

514
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,040
<font color="yellow">You'll have to support us then.</font>

515
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,340
<font color="yellow">When we're back, I'll tell you everything...</font>

516
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,570
<font color="yellow">about what you're curious about.</font>

517
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,270
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

518
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,910
<font color="yellow">Tae Woo.</font>

519
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,810
<font color="yellow">You really are alive.</font>

520
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,720
<font color="yellow">How did you...</font>

521
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,040
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

522
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,640
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

523
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,870
<font color="yellow">I guess you came to find San.</font>

524
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,210
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

525
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,240
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to ask.</font>

526
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,540
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

527
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,540
<font color="yellow">It seems like...</font>

528
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,440
<font color="yellow">you'll help us find him.</font>

529
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,710
<font color="yellow">Get him.</font>

530
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,640
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you asking...</font>

531
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,870
<font color="yellow">what happened to me?</font>

532
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,670
<font color="yellow">I know you don't want to talk about it.</font>

533
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:03,910
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

534
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,170
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

535
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,070
<font color="yellow">Bring San and Yu Jin to me.</font>

536
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,440
<font color="yellow">(Vampire Detective)</font>

537
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,740
<font color="yellow">I'll give you the real help.</font>

538
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,510
<font color="yellow">You have to trust me. We don't have time.</font>

539
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,630
<font color="yellow">Are you really with Yu Jin?</font>

540
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,830
<font color="yellow">As for Yu Jin, they'll get rid of her as a runaway.</font>

541
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,520
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to get away with it.</font>

542
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,720
<font color="yellow">Sorry about that. I know you feel inferior to San.</font>

543
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,770
<font color="yellow">I'll show you the consequences of breaking a promise.</font>

544
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,640
<font color="yellow">If you can't find in time, you'll all die.</font>

545
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,160
<font color="yellow">You have nothing to gain from this game,</font>

546
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,440
<font color="yellow">and I have nothing to lose.</font>

547
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,180
<font color="yellow">What did you do to San?</font>

548
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,930
<font color="yellow">If you act hastily, Goo Hyung will die.</font>

549
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,340
<font color="yellow">Kill him when I give you the signal.</font>

550
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,670
<font color="yellow">You'll get to see how San breaks down.</font>
