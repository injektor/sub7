<font color="yellow">I guess one thing didn't change.</font>

37
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,700

<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

<font color="yellow">But... This is real.</font>

46
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,820
<font color="yellow">I'm not stupid enough to hear that from you.</font>

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,650

48

<font color="yellow">Soon, you'll see...</font>

53
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180

<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

60
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,550
<font color="yellow">are you really with Yu Jin now?</font>

61
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

62
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,730
<font color="yellow">I'll explain it to you later. Please hurry up.</font>

63
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,850
<font color="yellow">All right. I got it.</font>

64
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,020
<font color="yellow">There must be a reason why you're doing this.</font>

65
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,770
<font color="yellow">I'll get the identification cards and passports.</font>

66
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,950
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

67
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,820
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

68
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,650
<font color="yellow">Was it...</font>

69
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,550
<font color="yellow">Goo Hyung?</font>

70
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,980
<font color="yellow">No, it was Sun Young. You remember her, right?</font>

71
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,550
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

72
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,980
<font color="yellow">How are they?</font>

73
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,550
<font color="yellow">They're doing fine as always.</font>

74
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

75
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,430
<font color="yellow">you really seem to be fine.</font>

76
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,520
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

77
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,450
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure...</font>

78
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,150
<font color="yellow">what exactly happened to me.</font>

79
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I brought it up.</font>

80
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,180
<font color="yellow">Don't be.</font>

81
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,820

82
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,180
<font color="yellow">it's been a long time since I saw sunlight.</font>

83
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,680
<font color="yellow">It's been so long since I walked along the street in the sun,</font>

84

<font color="yellow">met my friends...</font>

85

<font color="yellow">and had delicious dishes.</font>

86
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,170
<font color="yellow">This is Choi Sun Young.</font>

87
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,150
<font color="yellow">San called and asked me to get him fake ID cards and passports.</font>

88
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sending you his location because I'm worried about him.</font>

89
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,980
<font color="yellow">Is everything okay?</font>

90
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,550
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

91
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,620
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Goo Hyung.</font>

92
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,320
<font color="yellow">This is very helpful.</font>

93
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,450
<font color="yellow">Bring San and Yu Jin to me.</font>

94
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

95
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,680
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin. Are you okay?</font>

96
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,850
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

97
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,420
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

98
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,550
<font color="yellow">let me kill San.</font>

99
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,480
<font color="yellow">If you kill him,</font>

100
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,480
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to see you.</font>

101
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,520
<font color="yellow">Then promise me one thing.</font>

102
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,080
<font color="yellow">Promise me...</font>

103
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,020
<font color="yellow">that you'll become one of us.</font>

104
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,280

- Yes, Sir!</font>

106

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,390
<font color="yellow">I said what are you doing?</font>

126
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,550

<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

133
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,220

<font color="yellow">The helper list?</font>

138
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care about such a thing.</font>

139

<font color="yellow">You little!</font>

144
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,280
<font color="yellow">Also, you should be...</font>

145

147
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,180

150
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,550
<font color="yellow">Yes. Understood.</font>

151
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I'm making you so much trouble.</font>

152

160
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,490
<font color="yellow">I won't, either.</font>

161
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,680
<font color="yellow">That's what you said. We shouldn't give up.</font>

162
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,950
<font color="yellow">Hey, Yu Jin. Close your eyes.</font>

163
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,450
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Hurry up.</font>

164
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,520
<font color="yellow">Isn't...</font>

165
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,250
<font color="yellow">today's weather so nice?</font>

166
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,990
<font color="yellow">The ocean is beautiful.</font>

167
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,680
<font color="yellow">And the sunlight feels warm.</font>

168
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,720
<font color="yellow">The sunlight is so warm.</font>

169
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,990
<font color="yellow">Don't lose it again.</font>

170
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,680
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

171
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,220
<font color="yellow">We found where Jung Yu Jin is.</font>

172
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,810
<font color="yellow">Where's San?</font>

173
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,480
<font color="yellow">Where's San? You punks.</font>

174
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,010
<font color="yellow">Hey. Let go of me! I'll kill you.</font>

175
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,780
<font color="yellow">You're distracting me. Stay still.</font>

176
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,410
<font color="yellow">I told you...</font>

177
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,980
<font color="yellow">not to be rude to me.</font>

178
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,850
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

179
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,380
<font color="yellow">Your USB flash drive...</font>

180
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,750
<font color="yellow">Did you turn it into a tracking device?</font>

181
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,910
<font color="yellow">You better...</font>

182
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,580
<font color="yellow">hand it over.</font>

183
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,450
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

184
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,410
<font color="yellow">It's your last chance.</font>

185
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,950
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

186
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,610
<font color="yellow">You have to take me with you.</font>

187
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,750
<font color="yellow">I don't want to lose anyone any more.</font>

188
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,610
<font color="yellow">- Goo Hyung!
- San.</font>

189
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,450
<font color="yellow">San!</font>

190
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,440
<font color="yellow">San, run away.</font>

191
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,450
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

192
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,080
<font color="yellow">You two will have to come with us.</font>

193
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,680
<font color="yellow">If you do anything hasty,</font>

194
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,580
<font color="yellow">your friend will die.</font>

195
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,380
<font color="yellow">You better behave well.</font>

196
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,350
<font color="yellow">When I give you the sign, kill him.</font>

197
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,180
<font color="yellow">If this call turns off,</font>

198
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,450
<font color="yellow">kill him right away.</font>

199
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,180
<font color="yellow">That girl will take the second car.</font>

200
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,710
<font color="yellow">And you. You'll take another car behind her.</font>

201
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,250
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

202
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,980
<font color="yellow">Get off.</font>

203
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,850
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

204
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,950
<font color="yellow">And hand over the list.</font>

205
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,280
<font color="yellow">Why are we here all of a sudden?</font>

206
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,380
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

207
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,250
<font color="yellow">We're running out of time.</font>

208
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,780
<font color="yellow">You can't handle them by yourself.</font>

209
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,480
<font color="yellow">So go.</font>

210
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,310
<font color="yellow">Ask for help.</font>

211
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,210
<font color="yellow">Why should I believe you?</font>

212
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,180
<font color="yellow">You said you want to protect the people you love.</font>

213
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,780
<font color="yellow">So do I.</font>

214
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,010
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

215
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,780
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong, I will kill you.</font>

216
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,010
<font color="yellow">San.</font>

217
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
<font color="yellow">Goo Hyung is...</font>

218
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,780
<font color="yellow">someone important to you.</font>

219
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,780
<font color="yellow">I'll go first and wait for you there.</font>

220
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,350
<font color="yellow">I'll meet you there.</font>

221
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,750
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin.</font>

222
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,380
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

223
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,110
<font color="yellow">Detective Park!</font>

224
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,070
<font color="yellow">Gyeo Wool. What are you doing here? It's late.</font>

225
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,590
<font color="yellow">- We need to go right now.
- Hold on.</font>

226
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,340
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up!
- Where are we going?</font>

227
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,570
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. I have to finish eating.
- Hurry up.</font>

228
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,940
<font color="yellow">Just one second. Hold on.</font>

229
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,980
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

230
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

231
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin.</font>

232
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,750
<font color="yellow">I'll show you the consequences...</font>

233
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,580
<font color="yellow">of breaking a promise.</font>

234
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming, too.
- No, stay here.</font>

235
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,880
<font color="yellow">- No, I want to come.
- I said stay here!</font>

236
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,560
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous.</font>

237
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell me what it is?</font>

238
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,680
<font color="yellow">I just had something to take care of.</font>

239
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,150
<font color="yellow">Let me come with you next time. We're a team.</font>

240
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,680
<font color="yellow">There's one thing that I know for certain.</font>

241
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

242
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,750
<font color="yellow">Both of them care a great deal about you.</font>

243
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,270
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

244
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,780
<font color="yellow">Everyone except you knows this.</font>

245
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,650
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

246
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,620
<font color="yellow">Is this the fastest way?</font>

247
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,110
<font color="yellow">Yes. There isn't much traffic during this time.</font>

248
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,070
<font color="yellow">By the way, don't bang your head against the window.</font>

249
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,480
<font color="yellow">You'll get a bump on your head.</font>

250
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,640
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I leave the toilet when I'm not done yet,</font>

251
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,240
<font color="yellow">but I've never left food unfinished until today.</font>

252
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,650
<font color="yellow">We're going to be lucky today.</font>

253
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,010
<font color="yellow">You can trust me on this.</font>

254
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,880
<font color="yellow">I told you, San.</font>

255
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,410
<font color="yellow">I told you that was my last regard as your friend.</font>

256
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,190
<font color="yellow">Where are Goo Hyung and Yu Jin?</font>

257
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,210
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

258
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,350
<font color="yellow">Can't you figure out where they are today?</font>

259
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,710
<font color="yellow">You used to take a look around and speak as if you knew it all.</font>

260
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,480
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and take a look around.</font>

261
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,650
<font color="yellow">Can you figure out where they are?</font>

262
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
<font color="yellow">Can't you?</font>

263
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,850
<font color="yellow">I never liked how you talk so confidently.</font>

264
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,780
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

265
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,480
<font color="yellow">I'll show you that your confidence is wrong.</font>

266
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,910
<font color="yellow">Tae Woo.</font>

267
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for everything.</font>

268
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,480
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

269
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,980
<font color="yellow">What are you sorry for?</font>

270
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,250
<font color="yellow">What are you sorry for?</font>

271
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,180
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give you a gun.</font>

272
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,610
<font color="yellow">There is only one bullet inside.</font>

273
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,580
<font color="yellow">Do you see two people over there?</font>

274
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,910
<font color="yellow">One is Joo Young Gwang whom Yo Na has been looking for.</font>

275
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,710
<font color="yellow">The other one is Yong Goo Hyung, your dear friend.</font>

276
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,480
<font color="yellow">You can't be sure of who is sitting on either side.</font>

277
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,050
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is shoot one of them.</font>

278
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,580
<font color="yellow">You're a private detective.</font>

279
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,310
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting excited already?</font>

280
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,150
<font color="yellow">It's too early to get excited.</font>

281
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin.</font>

282
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,380
<font color="yellow">Do you remember that lamp?</font>

283
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,280
<font color="yellow">Let her go right now.</font>

284
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,610
<font color="yellow">You still don't get it, do you?</font>

285
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,110
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin!</font>

286
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,110
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now?</font>

287
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,480
<font color="yellow">I order and you listen.</font>

288
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,610
<font color="yellow">You won't...</font>

289
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,380
<font color="yellow">get anything from this.</font>

290
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
<font color="yellow">Of course I will.</font>

291
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,840
<font color="yellow">If you shoot Goo Hyung,</font>

292
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,610
<font color="yellow">you'll spend the rest of your life regretting it.</font>

293
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,440
<font color="yellow">If you shoot Young Gwang,</font>

294
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,580
<font color="yellow">I'll be the master of this organisation and get everything.</font>

295
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,660
<font color="yellow">You're the one who has nothing to gain in this game.</font>

296
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,050
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to lose.</font>

297
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,610
<font color="yellow">Give him the gun.</font>

298
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I'm dying to know...</font>

299
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,580
<font color="yellow">what your face is going to look like when you break down.</font>

300
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,210
<font color="yellow">We don't have time. Hurry up and shoot!</font>

301
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,180
<font color="yellow">When will the others arrive?</font>

302
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,580
<font color="yellow">They just got notified. They'll be a little late.</font>

303
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,470
<font color="yellow">We should hurry up.</font>

304
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,710
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

305
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,480
<font color="yellow">I would die if I were a human.</font>

306
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,350
<font color="yellow">But you and I...</font>

307
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,680
<font color="yellow">aren't humans any more.</font>

308
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,750
<font color="yellow">San.</font>

309
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,780
<font color="yellow">I'll count to 10.</font>

310
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,050
<font color="yellow">If you don't make a decision by then,</font>

311
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,010
<font color="yellow">Yu Jin will die.</font>

312
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,210
<font color="yellow">In 10...</font>

313
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
<font color="yellow">Nine...</font>

314
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,550

00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,380
<font color="yellow">That's why he keeps telling us to come here.</font>

476
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,740
<font color="yellow">Goo Hyung isn't stupid. Does he look stupid to you?</font>

477
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,500
<font color="yellow">Give me some tteokbokki.</font>

478
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,990
<font color="yellow">Did your tattoo shop go out of business?</font>

479
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,220
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

480
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,370
<font color="yellow">I'm getting some pocket money from this.</font>

481
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,900
<font color="yellow">What about you? Did you find that woman?</font>

482
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,840
<font color="yellow">No. Yo Na? Joo Young Gwang?</font>

483
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,040
<font color="yellow">There are no such people.</font>

484
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,200
<font color="yellow">You must have been dreaming.</font>

485
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,770
<font color="yellow">Also, who says they saw San here?</font>

486
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,140
<font color="yellow">We haven't seen him for a year. He must be abroad.</font>

487
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,840
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're a private detective?</font>

488
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,490
<font color="yellow">Is that why you switched it to a private investigation agency?</font>

489
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,000
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what loyalty is?</font>

490
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,340
<font color="yellow">I'll be a private detective again when San returns.</font>

491
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,870
<font color="yellow">Anyway, how can you eat chocolate in between tteokbokki?</font>

492
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,070
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

493
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,940
<font color="yellow">This is sweet, right?</font>

494
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,370
<font color="yellow">If you eat something sweet, you crave something salty.</font>

495
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,480
<font color="yellow">Same goes for the other way around. That's the truth about food.</font>

496
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,490
<font color="yellow">Look. Se Ra agrees with me.</font>

497
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,730
<font color="yellow">Let me see your teeth.</font>

498
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,100
<font color="yellow">Your upper teeth are black and your lower ones are red.</font>

499
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,970
<font color="yellow">- Are they?
- You're disgusting.</font>

500
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,670
<font color="yellow">Why don't us disgusting men...</font>

501
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,010
<font color="yellow">start a new business?</font>

502
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,980
<font color="yellow">If you and I partner up,</font>

503
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,130
<font color="yellow">we'd be like this chocolate and tteokbokki.</font>

504
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,570
<font color="yellow">We'll be the perfect team.</font>

505
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,460
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you.</font>

506
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,230
<font color="yellow">You have no sense of loyalty.</font>

507
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

508
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,470
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you have no sense of loyalty.</font>

509
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,800
<font color="yellow">I'll quit my job.</font>

510
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,740
<font color="yellow">This probably doesn't hurt because it's paper.</font>

511
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,100
<font color="yellow">I can't understand you even if I try.</font>

512
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

513
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Yong's Private Investigation Agency.</font>

514
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,070
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, Goo Hyung.</font>

515
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,540
<font color="yellow">Gyeo Wool?</font>

516
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,770
<font color="yellow">Did you really change it into a private investigation agency?</font>

517
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,630
<font color="yellow">Where have you been all this time? You punk!</font>

518
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,500
<font color="yellow">I heard you got kicked out from your uncle's place.</font>

519
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,570
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

520
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,470
<font color="yellow">Anyway, where are you? Where are you right now?</font>

521
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,300
<font color="yellow">I told you I'd be back when I find San.</font>

522
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,770
<font color="yellow">Did you find him?</font>

523
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,610
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

524
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,380
<font color="yellow">Do something about that chocolate and tteokbokki first.</font>

525
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,000
<font color="yellow">It's making me want to throw up.</font>

526
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,570
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

527
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,470
<font color="yellow">Detective Yong. Let me make an official request.</font>

528
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,440
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come with me to get San?</font>

529
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,490
<font color="yellow">- Where were you all this time?
- Ouch!</font>

530
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,350
<font color="yellow">Where on earth have you been? Where?</font>

531
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,100
<font color="yellow">- Well, I'm back.
- You punk!</font>

532
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,800
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Go where?</font>

533
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,830
<font color="yellow">Where do you think? To get San.</font>

534
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,840
<font color="yellow">Did you really find him?</font>

535
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,770
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm lying?</font>

536
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,070
<font color="yellow">- I know you lie all the time.
- Gosh.</font>

537
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,890
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I didn't know San would be there.</font>

538
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,630
<font color="yellow">- Did you really find him?
- Yes.</font>

539
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,130
<font color="yellow">- I'll kill you if it's a lie.
- All right.</font>

540
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,140
<font color="yellow">[Missing Person]</font>

541
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,640
<font color="yellow">[Thank you for watching Vampire Detective.]</font>

542
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,740
<font color="yellow">[Vampire Detective]</font>
