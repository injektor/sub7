00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,490
<font color="yellow"><i>The kidnapper has a fan club.</i></font>

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,840
<font color="yellow"><i>This is the fan club's symbol.
It's a "W" for Wanted.</i></font>

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Orson Welles.</i></font>

when she gave us Ha Dong Min's mission.</i></font>

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,890
<font color="yellow"><i>That is Doctor Ha Dong Min's lawyer.</i></font>

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,210
<font color="yellow"><i>It's a copycat.</i></font>

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,570
<font color="yellow"><i>I got the IP.</i></font>

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Is anyone in there?</i></font>

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,010
<font color="yellow"><i>Police. Put your hands up.</i></font>

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,100
<font color="yellow"><i>Something is off.</i></font>

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,500
<font color="yellow"><i>They were caught too easily.</i></font>

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,760
<font color="yellow"><i>Why isn't she picking up?
She should be back by now.</i></font>

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Please let me live!</i></font>

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,830
<font color="yellow"><i>Please let me live!</i></font>

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Save me.</i></font>

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,390
<font color="yellow"><i>That is one of ours.</i></font>

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,990

00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,590

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,220
<font color="yellow"><i>You just show up like this and
start asking me this nonsense.</i></font>

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,240
<font color="yellow"><i>You live in Seoul.</i></font>

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Where did you get so much dirt
on your shoes on the way to work?</i></font>

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,380
<font color="yellow"><i>Senior!</i></font>

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,570
<font color="yellow"><i>Please save me...</i></font>

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,300
<font color="yellow"><i>This is the seventh mission.</i></font>

00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,390
<font color="yellow"><i>Get Lee Ji Eun to appear on Wanted.</i></font>

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,580
<font color="yellow"><i>[EPISODE 10]</i></font>

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,110
<font color="yellow">Someone just jumped off the roof.</font>

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,100
<font color="yellow">I heard someone committed
suicide by jumping off the roof.</font>

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,570
<font color="yellow">Is the person connected to our show?</font>

31
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,970
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it.</font>

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,190
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,100
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,020
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.
I received the mission.</font>

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,370
<font color="yellow">When? Why are you telling us now?</font>

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,380
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long.</font>

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,480
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you on my way
to see Lee Ji Eun.</font>

38
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,910
<font color="yellow">That streamer?</font>

39
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,860
<font color="yellow">We better look into this first.</font>

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,980
<font color="yellow">We released the wrong preview because
of the copycat and have no time now.</font>

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,650
<font color="yellow">Right now, Lee Ji Eun is with
Detective Oh Mi Ock.</font>

42
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,940
<font color="yellow">- I'll head over there...
- Don't go alone.</font>

43
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,790
<font color="yellow">Things are dangerous right now,
so don't go alone.</font>

44
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,590
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon and I will
get ready for the show.</font>

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,550
<font color="yellow">- Joon Gu, you go with her.
- Okay.</font>

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,720
<font color="yellow">What about the dead...</font>

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="yellow">I think it's connected to our show.</font>

48
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,960
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it and call you.</font>

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Hye In.</font>

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,890
<font color="yellow">How did you know to come here?</font>

51
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,900
<font color="yellow">I heard that it was
Lee Ji Eun's mother who died.</font>

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,330
<font color="yellow">I'm in charge of Lee Ji Eun's case.</font>

53
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,110
<font color="yellow">It was suicide.</font>

54
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,240
<font color="yellow"><i>I did not raise my child properly
and caused this to happen.</i></font>

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,420
<font color="yellow"><i>In order to apologize to the world,
I will give up my life.</i></font>

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,530
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to do something to help,
but I can't do anything.</i></font>

57
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,880
<font color="yellow"><i>Watching all of this unfold
is so miserable for me.</i></font>

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,350
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Hye In, I am truly sorry.</i></font>

59
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,330
<font color="yellow"><i>I hope Song Hyun Woo returns home safely
and will pray for it from the afterlife.</i></font>

60
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Have you ever seen
your daughter's boyfriend?</i></font>

61
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,840
<font color="yellow">No! She seems very excited lately.</font>

62
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,340
<font color="yellow">Her boyfriend has connections
to a broadcast station.</font>

63
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,290
<font color="yellow">He promised to get her a debut.</font>

64
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,220
<font color="yellow">She met that punk somewhere
and has been on a high lately.</font>

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,180
<font color="yellow">A girl like that has been missing for
three days and you didn't report it?</font>

66
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,940
<font color="yellow">What about CCTV?</font>

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,420
<font color="yellow">They were inspecting the security system.
It hasn't been on since yesterday.</font>

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,330
<font color="yellow">How could the system not be working
in this station of all places?</font>

69
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,240
<font color="yellow">Two people were murdered here.</font>

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,770
<font color="yellow">One member of the team nearly died.</font>

71
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was the culprit.</font>

72
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,600
<font color="yellow">He could have hacked in
and broken the system.</font>

73
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,060
<font color="yellow">I told you, didn't I?</font>

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,950
<font color="yellow">The culprit is definitely
in the broadcast team.</font>

75
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,440
<font color="yellow">It could have been
hacked from outside.</font>

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,090
<font color="yellow">If you focus too much on that,
you could lose...</font>

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,040
<font color="yellow">I'm looking into it,
so mind your own business.</font>

78
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,340
<font color="yellow">All right, but I want to investigate
this suicide case.</font>

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,040
<font color="yellow">This is connected to
the broadcast station too.</font>

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,690
<font color="yellow">If you find anything, share it with me.</font>

81
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,850
<font color="yellow">Why did he send a picture of Lee Ji Eun's
family with this mission?</font>

82
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,930
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is very sensitive to any
topic related to her father.</font>

83
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,060
<font color="yellow">Just like Na Soo Hyun is getting revenge
for his brother Na Jae Hyun.</font>

84
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,360
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun got involved in this
because of her father?</font>

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,510
<font color="yellow">Then should we discuss
her father on the show?</font>

86
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,890
<font color="yellow">You'll have to go a step
further than that.</font>

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,840
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper is being shaken right now.</font>

88
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,160
<font color="yellow">There are four more episodes to go.</font>

89
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,400
<font color="yellow">Once Na Jae Hyun's remains were found...</font>

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,630
<font color="yellow">the kidnapper wanted to find out why the
commissioner closed his brother's case.</font>

91
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,350
<font color="yellow">The key to this case is to find out why
my late husband and Na Jae Hyun met.</font>

92
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,500
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,020
<font color="yellow">As we keep investigating this case,
that is where it will lead us.</font>

94
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,500
<font color="yellow">Once we get to ten episodes,
that will be the final big picture.</font>

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,930
<font color="yellow">However, the police commissioner
committed suicide.</font>

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,940
<font color="yellow">Also, Bo Yeon was kidnapped
by copycat fans.</font>

97
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,820
<font color="yellow">The show is in danger.</font>

98
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,900
<font color="yellow">Then was he never planning
to put Lee Ji Eun on the show?</font>

99
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,190
<font color="yellow">I think that is highly likely.</font>

100
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,560
<font color="yellow">I think he is getting impatient.</font>

101
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,140
<font color="yellow">He is changing his plans to
expose the important points.</font>

102
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,980
<font color="yellow">If only I could find out
more about Lee Ji Eun...</font>

103
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,260
<font color="yellow">This is our chance
to get ahead of the kidnapper.</font>

104
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,840
<font color="yellow">You should meet with Lee Ji Eun.</font>

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,380
<font color="yellow">We don't have to put
everything we find on the show.</font>

106
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,580
<font color="yellow">Just getting her to appear
is completing the mission.</font>

107
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,460
<font color="yellow">It's good to do something
the kidnapper isn't expecting.</font>

108
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,460
<font color="yellow">How will we get Lee Ji Eun on the show
when she's in prison?</font>

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,250
<font color="yellow">For this mission, they need the
accomplice on the show.</font>

110
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,210
<font color="yellow">That's a bit difficult.</font>

111
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,320
<font color="yellow">She's a detained criminal.</font>

112
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,460
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a special case though?</font>

113
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,570
<font color="yellow">The Wanted program is
a part of the investigation.</font>

114
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,980
<font color="yellow">The police have agreed to
cooperate closely with the show.</font>

115
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,630
<font color="yellow">The public already has many complaints.</font>

116
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,160
<font color="yellow">We're looking forward to seeing
how you will lead the police.</font>

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,030
<font color="yellow">My father has very high expectations.</font>

118
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,600
<font color="yellow">The late commissioner had
his image and personal issues.</font>

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,600
<font color="yellow">He showed us his inconsistencies.</font>

120
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,850
<font color="yellow">Do you have articles
written about that streamer?</font>

121
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,000
<font color="yellow">I think you need to write
them earlier than I thought.</font>

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,410
<font color="yellow">We need to get people
interested in this mission.</font>

123
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,830
<font color="yellow">Isn't it kind of odd if I write it?</font>

124
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,670
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

125
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:41,180
<font color="yellow">I'm going to write articles
as a close member of this team.</font>

126
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,330
<font color="yellow">I don't even know
the results of this case.</font>

127
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,030
<font color="yellow">If I write this in the midst of things...</font>

128
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,770
<font color="yellow">people won't trust my book.</font>

129
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,750
<font color="yellow">That's not what we agreed upon.</font>

130
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,670
<font color="yellow">Don't get upset and listen.</font>

131
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,620
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is,
that story is already...</font>

132
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,410
<font color="yellow">given as a special to another writer.</font>

133
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,390
<font color="yellow">Can we get it viral before the show?</font>

134
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,230
<font color="yellow">It's been up for two hours now.
It's on the main portal sites.</font>

135
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,800
<font color="yellow">Everyone's talking about it.
Why bother asking that?</font>

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,840
<font color="yellow">I heard ratings went up yesterday
to 39 percent in Bundang.</font>

137
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,670
<font color="yellow">The person who committed suicide
was that streamer's mother?</font>

138
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,180
<font color="yellow">She's Lee Ji Eun's only family.</font>

139
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,620
<font color="yellow">She hasn't confirmed it herself,
but there was a suicide note.</font>

140
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,160
<font color="yellow">There was an ID too.</font>

141
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,160
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha Seung In met her before,
so he confirmed it for us.</font>

142
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,190
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it was suicide?</font>

143
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,620
<font color="yellow">It looks that way.</font>

144
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,930
<font color="yellow">About Lee Ji Eun's mother's suicide,
please don't tell Director Shin yet.</font>

145
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,590
<font color="yellow">Today's mission is about Lee Ji Eun.</font>

146
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,600
<font color="yellow">I think we need to decide whether
this should be in the show or not.</font>

147
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,110
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

148
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,550
<font color="yellow">What were you going
to say on the show today?</font>

149
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,990
<font color="yellow">It's the seventh mission.</font>

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,370
<font color="yellow">Get Lee Ji Eun to appear on Wanted.</font>

151
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,140
<font color="yellow">He sent a picture of your family too.</font>

152
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,630
<font color="yellow">I'm guessing he wants you
to talk about your family.</font>

153
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,030
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you kidnapped Hyun Woo.</font>

154
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,350
<font color="yellow">And I don't know why
you helped him kill people.</font>

155
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,890
<font color="yellow">You have to talk to us
for all of this to end.</font>

156
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,780
<font color="yellow">I can't go on the show.</font>

157
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,150
<font color="yellow">Then tell me now.</font>

158
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,990
<font color="yellow">Who is behind everything
and where is Hyun Woo?</font>

159
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,820
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo...</font>

160
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Hyun Woo is safe.</font>

161
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,930
<font color="yellow">Did the culprit tell you you'd
have to appear on the show?</font>

162
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,580
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you the commissioner
would commit suicide?</font>

163
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,120
<font color="yellow">That the crew would be taken
hostage and buried alive!</font>

164
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

165
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,320
<font color="yellow">Ji Eun, you need to make a choice.</font>

166
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,280
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we tell Lee Ji Eun about this?</font>

167
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,460
<font color="yellow">She may become emotional when she
hears her mother committed suicide.</font>

168
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,050
<font color="yellow">She might tell us everything.</font>

169
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,440
<font color="yellow">It might end up backfiring on us.</font>

170
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,530
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

171
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,020
<font color="yellow">I'm saying it might not be suicide.</font>

172
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,590
<font color="yellow">If she figures that out,
Lee Ji Eun might become more reckless.</font>

173
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,060
<font color="yellow">She will want revenge for her mother.</font>

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,700
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it's not suicide?</font>

175
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,860
<font color="yellow">Then who would it be... Na Soo Hyun?</font>

176
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,450
<font color="yellow">It would be the person who
hired Jo Nam Chul as a hit man.</font>

177
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,430
<font color="yellow">This person was able to get the late
commissioner to close Na Jae Hyun's case.</font>

178
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,860
<font color="yellow">He covered up the death
of the son of the SG Group.</font>

179
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,930
<font color="yellow">Why would this person
kill Lee Ji Eun's mother?</font>

180
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,950
<font color="yellow">Because Lee Ji Eun is connected
to what happened seven years ago.</font>

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,370
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun's mother must
know something too.</font>

182
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,100
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, she was trying
to get in touch with that person.</font>

183
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,670
<font color="yellow">I should have thought of it earlier.</font>

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,460
<font color="yellow">But, there was a suicide
and the reason makes sense.</font>

185
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,740
<font color="yellow">Isn't your theory too far-fetched?</font>

186
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,780
<font color="yellow">The suicide note isn't quite right.</font>

187
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,790
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

188
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,480
<font color="yellow">90 percent of unnatural
deaths are suicide.</font>

189
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,540
<font color="yellow">Most of time, there is no suicide note.</font>

190
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,090
<font color="yellow">Before committing suicide,
people are in a state of anxiety.</font>

191
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,610
<font color="yellow">Even if they do write one,
it's hard to write one so logically.</font>

192
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,850
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun's case happened very suddenly.</font>

193
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,450
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have prepared
for the suicide in advance.</font>

194
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,080
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun's mother
didn't seem very educated.</font>

195
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,250
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to rush the autopsy.</font>

196
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,450
<font color="yellow">Don't be too sure
about anything until then.</font>

197
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,230
<font color="yellow">The only person who would know
anything is Ha Dong Min.</font>

198
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,890
<font color="yellow">I'm going to meet Ha Dong Min.</font>

199
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,870
<font color="yellow">Senior, Lee Ji Eun's in danger too.</font>

200
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,400
<font color="yellow">- Be careful with her.
- Okay, I got it.</font>

201
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,180
<font color="yellow">We have permission for now.</font>

202
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,520
<font color="yellow">We're going to take her once
Hye In is finished talking.</font>

203
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,740
<font color="yellow">Okay, call me.</font>

204
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,630
<font color="yellow">Have they identified
who committed suicide?</font>

205
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,640
<font color="yellow">No, I think they need
to look into it some more.</font>

206
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,850
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

207
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,480
<font color="yellow">Sign this.</font>

208
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,020
<font color="yellow">This is a first for us.</font>

209
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,610
<font color="yellow">Two policemen will have
to be with her at all times.</font>

210
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,720
<font color="yellow">Once the show ends at 11:00 p.m.,
the police will bring her back here.</font>

211
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,040
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

212
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,890
<font color="yellow">Wait here a moment.</font>

213
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,700
<font color="yellow">He talked to his lawyer just an hour ago.</font>

214
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,070
<font color="yellow">I made sure he went into his cell.</font>

215
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,270
<font color="yellow">He was acting no different than usual.</font>

216
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,290
<font color="yellow">Actually, he seemed like
he was in a good mood.</font>

217
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,320
<font color="yellow">Can I take a look at the scene?</font>

218
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,130
<font color="yellow">That could a bit difficult.</font>

219
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,600
<font color="yellow">You should leave for now.</font>

220
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,620
<font color="yellow">I believe in him.</font>

221
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,260
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

222
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,900
<font color="yellow">Right now, the thing you and the police
couldn't do seven years ago...</font>

223
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,640
<font color="yellow">he is doing it.</font>

224
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,930
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago,
you lived your lives without a care.</font>

225
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,270
<font color="yellow">Only now, you're all starting
to think about what happened.</font>

226
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,030
<font color="yellow">That's why he is right.</font>

227
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,780
<font color="yellow">So tell me about it.</font>

228
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,240
<font color="yellow">What happened seven years ago?
What is it that you want?</font>

229
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,820
<font color="yellow">Your show... I will go on it.</font>

230
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,420
<font color="yellow">I will only say it in
front of all the viewers.</font>

231
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,870
<font color="yellow">I don't trust you either, Jung Hye In.</font>

232
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,000
<font color="yellow">I think you need to come with me.</font>

233
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,510
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

234
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,650
<font color="yellow">A delivery came for Park Bo Yeon.</font>

235
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,660
<font color="yellow">There was something
strange written inside of it.</font>

236
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,910
<font color="yellow">And the deliveryman?</font>

237
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,700
<font color="yellow">Our security has him for now,
but he's creating a commotion.</font>

238
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,550
<font color="yellow">What do we do about here?</font>

239
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,870
<font color="yellow">Someone needs to stay here.</font>

240
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, someone is coming.</font>

241
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,230
<font color="yellow">- Watch the door.
- Let's go.</font>

242
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,400
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

243
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,030
<font color="yellow">Is this Park Bo Yeon's room?</font>

244
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,600
<font color="yellow">Her doctor told me to check on her.</font>

245
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,530
<font color="yellow"><i>[SONG YOUNG SOO]
Ah...</i></font>

246
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,360
<font color="yellow">You're going to stay here, right?</font>

247
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,620
<font color="yellow">A suspicious person could come by,
so stay with her until the police come.</font>

248
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,350
<font color="yellow">I was actually paged to go to room 301.</font>

249
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,930
<font color="yellow">Okay. Don't worry.</font>

250
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,860
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

251
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,500
<font color="yellow">Don't be afraid.</font>

252
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,330
<font color="yellow">I'm not here to hurt you.</font>

253
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

254
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,980
<font color="yellow">Other people deserved it.</font>

255
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,410
<font color="yellow">But, Bo Yeon...</font>

256
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,980
<font color="yellow">that should not have happened to you.</font>

257
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,710
<font color="yellow">You haven't done anything wrong.</font>

258
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,700
<font color="yellow">Because of what happened to you,
you will continue to struggle with it.</font>

259
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,600
<font color="yellow">I know that and I'm very sorry.</font>

260
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,640
<font color="yellow">But, I don't have much time.</font>

261
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,150
<font color="yellow">I have one last thing to do.</font>

262
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,520
<font color="yellow">I am very sorry, but...</font>

263
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,890
<font color="yellow">I need to ask you a favor.</font>

264
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,890
<font color="yellow">This note...</font>

265
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,100
<font color="yellow">Please deliver it to
Lieutenant Cha Seung In.</font>

266
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,680
<font color="yellow">What... is it?</font>

267
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,330
<font color="yellow">That's all you need to do.</font>

268
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,820
<font color="yellow">I thought he was drunk.</font>

269
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,390
<font color="yellow">He was drunk.
That's why he was acting like that.</font>

271
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,060
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to go on this show?</font>

272
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,720
<font color="yellow">Haven't you considered the fact that
you're being used by the culprit?</font>

273
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,660
<font color="yellow">Everyone who appeared on this show died
or had bad things happen to them.</font>

274
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,980
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

275
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,780
<font color="yellow">Just tell us who it is.</font>

276
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,390
<font color="yellow">If you tell us everything,
you won't be an accomplice.</font>

277
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,160
<font color="yellow">We'll say that you were kidnapped by
Park Sae Yong and had no choice.</font>

278
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,010
<font color="yellow">Could you step outside for a moment?</font>

279
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,350
<font color="yellow">Don't you know she has to be escorted
by two policemen at all times?</font>

280
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,990
<font color="yellow">That's why there are two of them outside.</font>

281
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,180
<font color="yellow">You can go out there
and keep watch if you want.</font>

282
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,940
<font color="yellow">Why should I have to do that?</font>

283
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,720
<font color="yellow">Didn't the police give permission
for her to appear on the show?</font>

284
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,080
<font color="yellow">Let her rest for a bit.
She's just a young girl.</font>

285
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,980
<font color="yellow">Let's leave for a bit.
She not going to talk.</font>

286
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,870
<font color="yellow">You two stay put here.
We'll check on you later.</font>

287
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,200
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

288
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,090
<font color="yellow">Detective Park.</font>

289
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,950
<font color="yellow">What? You're on the
broadcast team, aren't you?</font>

290
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,860
<font color="yellow">You don't have any business with me.</font>

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,210

You're one of the main characters.</font>

<font color="yellow">You said would help your investigation
if I gave you inside information.</font>

294
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,620
<font color="yellow">I wonder if this will help.</font>

295
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,400
<font color="yellow">It's an audio file of a conversation
with Director Shin Dong Wook.</font>

296
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,990
<font color="yellow">There's one of him talking
with Writer Yeon too.</font>

297
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving me this?</font>

298
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,960
<font color="yellow">Honestly, Director Shin is someone
that's a concern for you.</font>

299
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,140
<font color="yellow">I know you consider him a suspect.</font>

300
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,710
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

301
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,170
<font color="yellow">He is suspicious.</font>

302
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,060
<font color="yellow">A kidnapper that's demanding a show
that looks impossible to do.</font>

303
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,110
<font color="yellow">Then there's the director past his prime
who is looking for his comeback.</font>

304
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,530
<font color="yellow">He is strangely focused on the show,
to the point that it seems cruel.</font>

305
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,380
<font color="yellow">He doesn't come off like someone
desperate to find a child.</font>

306
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,910
<font color="yellow">So, what?</font>

307
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,950
<font color="yellow">I wanted to confirm my theory.</font>

308
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,430
<font color="yellow">You think Shin Dong Wook is the culprit?</font>

309
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:13,020
<font color="yellow">People become more honest in front of
people they think are similar to them.</font>

310
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,720
<font color="yellow">Give it a listen and think about it.</font>

311
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,650
<font color="yellow">What do you get out of this?</font>

312
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,270
<font color="yellow">Behind-the-scenes!</font>

313
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,290
<font color="yellow">When the book is released,
would an observer's story be very fun?</font>

314
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,700
<font color="yellow">Or would the story from the man on
the front lines be more exciting?</font>

315
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,290
<font color="yellow">If people aren't on my side...</font>

316
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,860
<font color="yellow">they won't trust the stories
coming from my point of view.</font>

317
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,800
<font color="yellow">I heard you visited Bo Yeon.</font>

318
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,750
<font color="yellow">You said you wouldn't go with us.</font>

319
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,110
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon was happy.</font>

320
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,200
<font color="yellow">Going in a big group isn't my style.</font>

321
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,070
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to see her face.</font>

322
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,330
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this show, Director?</font>

323
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,230
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking of a comeback
after making it a big hit?</font>

324
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,450
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

325
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,970
<font color="yellow">I think this show could end my career.</font>

326
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,950
<font color="yellow">Then why are going so far with it?</font>

327
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,510
<font color="yellow">Should I be honest?</font>

328
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,230
<font color="yellow">A chance to make a show like this won't
come again in my lifetime.</font>

329
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,530
<font color="yellow">I'd bet no one else in
the world will get this chance.</font>

330
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,710
<font color="yellow">Chance?</font>

331
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,430
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper has his plans and
I just need to carry that out faithfully.</font>

332
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,330
<font color="yellow">I have to make it good and entertaining,
so that many people want to watch.</font>

333
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,120
<font color="yellow">Whether the people watching go crazy
over it, criticize it, or copy it...</font>

334
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,830
<font color="yellow">that is their problem.</font>

335
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,700
<font color="yellow">What do you get out of this?</font>

336
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,720
<font color="yellow">To see how a show can provoke
and stir people up.</font>

337
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,780
<font color="yellow">To see how people make this show.</font>

338
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,480
<font color="yellow">I want to see for myself,
how it all ends.</font>

339
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,760
<font color="yellow">Call me again. Okay.</font>

340
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,040
<font color="yellow">I've been curious about something.</font>

341
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,810
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you about it?</font>

342
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, go ahead.</font>

343
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,370
<font color="yellow">A long time ago, you used to make
documentaries on corrupt companies.</font>

344
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,720
<font color="yellow">You got sued often for defamation.</font>

345
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,230
<font color="yellow">I got my house seized.</font>

346
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,960
<font color="yellow">The writers had their
personal emails inspected.</font>

347
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,250
<font color="yellow">I went to court often too.</font>

348
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,880
<font color="yellow">I recall seeing some of them.</font>

349
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,470
<font color="yellow">Yet, you continued to make
documentaries on those issues.</font>

350
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,050
<font color="yellow">That was my job.</font>

351
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,180
<font color="yellow">Not just anyone has a job like that.</font>

352
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,620
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep doing them?</font>

353
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,160
<font color="yellow">I had a very pure heart back then.</font>

354
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,420
<font color="yellow">I thought broadcasting was
for doing work like that.</font>

355
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,040
<font color="yellow">You had to inform people about things.</font>

356
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
<font color="yellow">Something like...
I had to change the world.</font>

357
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,070
<font color="yellow">What about now?</font>

358
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,610
<font color="yellow">What? Now...</font>

359
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,030
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

360
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,820
<font color="yellow">I thought that I had a part to play here.</font>

361
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,620
<font color="yellow">I couldn't put a stop to anything bad.</font>

362
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,960
<font color="yellow">I just don't know.</font>

363
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,080
<font color="yellow">Is Han Sol doing well?</font>

364
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,450
<font color="yellow">He'll probably need some more time.</font>

365
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,020
<font color="yellow">Still, he is eating well
and sleeping these days.</font>

366
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,960
<font color="yellow">He talks about you often and
says he misses you.</font>

367
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,200
<font color="yellow">I brought the files you mentioned.</font>

368
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,430
<font color="yellow">Though, I'm not sure
if it's the right thing.</font>

369
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,980
<font color="yellow">These are his personal files
from his work, right?</font>

370
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, he didn't bring these home.</font>

371
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,490
<font color="yellow">So, he was an assistant professor of
veterinary science seven years ago?</font>

372
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,810
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

373
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,520
<font color="yellow">Eight years ago, we met on a blind date
and planned to marry within two months.</font>

374
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,930
<font color="yellow">He was an assistant professor then.</font>

375
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,990
<font color="yellow">He was so busy then.
We fought a lot.</font>

376
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,110
<font color="yellow">You don't know why he was so busy?</font>

377
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,220
<font color="yellow">Well, I... I wouldn't really understand
it even if he explained his work to me.</font>

378
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,770
<font color="yellow">Back then...</font>

379
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:48,260
<font color="yellow">I think he was researching something
an external company requested.</font>

380
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,570
<font color="yellow">He was assigned as
the research team leader.</font>

381
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,650
<font color="yellow">That's all I remember.</font>

382
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,530
<font color="yellow">Even after we married,
he was so busy for about a year.</font>

383
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,320
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

384
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,970
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

385
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,630
<font color="yellow"><i>[2008 MAY RESEARCH COSTS]</i></font>

386
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,620
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

387
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,820
<font color="yellow">Does Han Sol's father's death have
anything to do with something back then?</font>

388
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,180
<font color="yellow">We're looking into many
different possibilities.</font>

389
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,130
<font color="yellow">Could we take these and look at them?</font>

390
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,820
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

391
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,600
<font color="yellow">Don't be good to me.</font>

392
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,910
<font color="yellow">I hated you a lot, at first.</font>

393
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,350
<font color="yellow">No, I still hate you.</font>

394
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,980
<font color="yellow">You could say one word.</font>

395
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,810
<font color="yellow">If you would just tell us who...</font>

396
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,970
<font color="yellow">I could find Hyun Woo right now.</font>

397
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,740
<font color="yellow">But, now...</font>

398
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,180
<font color="yellow">I can't help but think
you're a victim too.</font>

399
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,300
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this because I want to.</font>

400
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,350
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you know me.</font>

401
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,690
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what it
means that you want to do this.</font>

402
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,310
<font color="yellow">What kind of person are you?</font>

403
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,530
<font color="yellow">What was your life like?</font>

404
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,550
<font color="yellow">I started acting when I was seven.</font>

405
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,020
<font color="yellow">I had to recognize what
people wanted when I was seven.</font>

406
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,300
<font color="yellow">I learned how to do what they wanted.</font>

407
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,010
<font color="yellow">I was always around adults.</font>

408
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying all this to me?</font>

409
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,120
<font color="yellow">I never thought about
what it was that I really wanted.</font>

410
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,360
<font color="yellow">About how I want to live...</font>

411
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,630
<font color="yellow">I have never thought about it.</font>

412
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,130
<font color="yellow">When my husband died,
I ran off to another country.</font>

413
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,440
<font color="yellow">When I announced my retirement on the
day that Hyun Woo was kidnapped...</font>

414
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,820
<font color="yellow">I did everything to protect Hyun Woo.</font>

415
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,470
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is the most
precious thing to me.</font>

416
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,550
<font color="yellow">More precious than my life.</font>

417
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,440
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is more important.</font>

418
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,390
<font color="yellow">Did you have something you wanted
to protect like that too?</font>

419
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,660
<font color="yellow">Chief, we just entered
Lee Ji Eun's house.</font>

420
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,070
<font color="yellow">I think it's been empty for a few days.</font>

421
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,870
<font color="yellow">I'll call you if I find anything.</font>

422
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

423
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,280
<font color="yellow">You can't always
enter without permission.</font>

424
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,880
<font color="yellow">It may not seem that way,
but there is a criteria.</font>

425
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,010
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

426
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,460
<font color="yellow">What should I be looking for?</font>

427
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,110
<font color="yellow">Look for anything belonging
to Lee Ji Eun's father.</font>

428
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,360
<font color="yellow">Also, traces that anyone
entered by force.</font>

429
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,090
<font color="yellow">Look for blood too.</font>

430
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,810
<font color="yellow">Look for signs that Lee Ji Eun's
mother was attacked.</font>

431
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,550
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

442
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,320
<font color="yellow">You could've been in trouble.</font>

443
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,950
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

444
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,000
<font color="yellow">I'm your dad's friend from work.</font>

445
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,760
<font color="yellow">I saw you a few times
when you were young.</font>

446
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,170
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't remember.</font>

447
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,990
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

448
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you out so late?
That guy was really following you.</font>

449
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,130
<font color="yellow">I was on my way to see your dad.
You could've been in trouble.</font>

450
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,460
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

451
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,360
<font color="yellow">Your dad is home, right?</font>

452
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that looks heavy.</font>

453
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,810
<font color="yellow">- You must study hard.
- It's okay.</font>

454
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,770
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. I'll carry it.</font>

455
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,410
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go.</font>

456
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,410
<font color="yellow">Dad! Your friend is here...</font>

457
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,980
<font color="yellow">You... you punk!</font>

458
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
<font color="yellow">How dare you show up here.</font>

459
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,620
<font color="yellow">Why... why would you be with my daughter?</font>

460
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,880
<font color="yellow">You little punk!</font>

461
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,080
<font color="yellow">Dad, Dad!</font>

462
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,460
<font color="yellow">You're very drunk.</font>

463
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,920
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

464
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,210
<font color="yellow">Has your dad like this lately?</font>

465
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,000
<font color="yellow">No, the thing is...</font>

466
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
<font color="yellow">I guess today won't do.</font>

467
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,910
<font color="yellow">I'll come back another time.</font>

468
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,690
<font color="yellow">Don't walk around late at night.
It's dangerous.</font>

469
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,530
<font color="yellow">With a dad like this,
how can he protect his daughter?</font>

470
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,670
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

471
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,490
<font color="yellow">See you next time, Ji Eun.</font>

472
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,740
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

473
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,850
<font color="yellow">Who told you to go around with
people you don't even know?</font>

474
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,250
<font color="yellow">He said he was your friend.</font>

475
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,250
<font color="yellow">He said he saw me when I was younger.</font>

476
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,660
<font color="yellow">Get inside now!</font>

477
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,220
<font color="yellow">If you ever do that again,
I won't let you out of the house.</font>

478
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,770
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to keep this up?</font>

479
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,600
<font color="yellow">I wish you would just die.</font>

480
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,930
<font color="yellow">Then Mom would come back.</font>

481
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,870
<font color="yellow">That was the last time I saw him alive.</font>

482
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,430
<font color="yellow">The next day...</font>

483
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,540
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

484
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,360
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

485
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,750
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

486
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,150
<font color="yellow">My mom didn't come to my dad's funeral.</font>

487
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,590
<font color="yellow">I had been living alone for two months
when my mom showed up.</font>

488
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,090
<font color="yellow">I haven't spoken to my mom since.</font>

489
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,270
<font color="yellow">So, it's not that you
want to protect something.</font>

490
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,590
<font color="yellow">Your mom and dad couldn't protect you.</font>

491
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,530
<font color="yellow">Are you this way because
you're angry about that?</font>

492
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

493
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,320
<font color="yellow">My dad did that in order to save me.</font>

494
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,040
<font color="yellow">He had to die.</font>

495
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,540
<font color="yellow">He thought that was
the way everything would end.</font>

496
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,930
<font color="yellow">It wasn't my dad who couldn't protect me.</font>

497
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,680
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, it was you
who couldn't protect Hyun Woo.</font>

498
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,350
<font color="yellow">That day, you could have stopped
him from taking Hyun Woo.</font>

499
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,380
<font color="yellow">I bet Hyun Woo was thinking that too.</font>

500
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,660
<font color="yellow">"My mom couldn't protect me."</font>

501
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,580
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

502
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,170
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

503
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,340
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, are you hurt at all?</font>

504

505
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,110
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

506
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,780
<font color="yellow">Is this because you were
talking to Lee Ji Eun?</font>

507
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,700
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

508
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,860
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

509
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,660
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

510
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,270
<font color="yellow">I know it wasn't easy.</font>

511
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,780
<font color="yellow">She's a smart girl.</font>

512
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,670
<font color="yellow">She has you shaken up like this.</font>

513
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,150
<font color="yellow">She opened up only
as much as she needed</font>

514
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,600
<font color="yellow">then shut down the conversation.</font>

515
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,620
<font color="yellow">Then what do I do now?</font>

516
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,290
<font color="yellow">She will likely only say what
she needs to on the show tonight.</font>

517
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,220
<font color="yellow">You said we need
to go further than that.</font>

518
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,520
<font color="yellow">You know the body you saw
in front of the station today?</font>

519
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,160
<font color="yellow">That is Ji Eun's mother.</font>

520
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,820
<font color="yellow">She left a suicide note.</font>

521
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,330
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it was suicide?</font>

522
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,070
<font color="yellow">We'll have to wait a bit for the autopsy.</font>

523
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,020
<font color="yellow">We're investigating.</font>

524
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,790
<font color="yellow">Does Lee Ji Eun know?</font>

525
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

526
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me this right now?</font>

527
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,350
<font color="yellow">Not everyone on
the crew knows about it.</font>

528
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,060
<font color="yellow">Detective Park told me that
Writer Yeon knows about it.</font>

529
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,060
<font color="yellow">She asked him not to tell Director Shin.</font>

530
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,980
<font color="yellow">I don't think she wants it on the show.</font>

531
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,950
<font color="yellow">You can use it at
the right time, just once.</font>

532
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:10,080
<font color="yellow">When Lee Ji Eun is not expecting it,
you can use it to shock her.</font>

533
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,130
<font color="yellow"><i>[LIEUTENANT CHA SEUNG IN]</i></font>

534
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lieutenant Cha. I'll be right down.</font>

535
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,840
<font color="yellow">I think I need to head downstairs.</font>

536
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,370
<font color="yellow">I can't leave Lee Ji Eun alone.</font>

537
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,630
<font color="yellow">I'll stay with her. You can go.</font>

538
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

539
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,760
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is with Jung Hye In.</font>

540
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,940
<font color="yellow">Nothing else is going on. Okay.</font>

541
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,590
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

542
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,290
<font color="yellow">You know that woman who fell
off the broadcast station roof?</font>

543
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,730
<font color="yellow">I hear she's a UCN employee.</font>

544
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,900
<font color="yellow">I heard she criticized Wanted
and committed suicide.</font>

545
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,600
<font color="yellow">Sort of like burning yourself to death,
like in protest.</font>

546
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,060
<font color="yellow">Who told you that?</font>

547
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,690
<font color="yellow">My friend.</font>

548
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,500
<font color="yellow">He's a writer for Youngjin Daily.
He's publishing an article tomorrow.</font>

549
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,100
<font color="yellow">He has a source at the police.</font>

550
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,610
<font color="yellow">He even has a copy of the suicide note.</font>

551
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,980
<font color="yellow">What nonsense. Is he crazy?</font>

552
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,170
<font color="yellow">We haven't even officially confirmed the
body because Lee Ji Eun was in prison.</font>

553
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,960
<font color="yellow">What does Lee Ji Eun being
in prison have to do with the body?</font>

554
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,370
<font color="yellow">Is it Lee Ji Eun's mom?</font>

555
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,950
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

556
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,060
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that and just tell me.</font>

557
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,870
<font color="yellow">I just met with Lieutenant Park and
gave him some really good information.</font>

558
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,690
<font color="yellow">We're very close, you know.</font>

559
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,560
<font color="yellow">You won't get in trouble
with him for telling me.</font>

560
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,000
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to write an article.
It's just for my book.</font>

561
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,460
<font color="yellow">I have to record everything that
happens on the scene daily.</font>

562
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,780
<font color="yellow">You can't write this article yet.</font>

563
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,020
<font color="yellow">I told you I won't.</font>

564
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,080
<font color="yellow">You know we're going to have
an audience today, right?</font>

565
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,530
<font color="yellow">Director Shin.</font>

566
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,810
<font color="yellow">I need to see you for a second.</font>

567
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,380
<font color="yellow">Are you lucky or what, Director Shin?</font>

568
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,300
<font color="yellow">The whole world is helping Wanted.</font>

569
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,810
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

570
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,100
<font color="yellow">The woman who fell from the roof today.</font>

571
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,980
<font color="yellow"><i>[SUICIDE NOTE]</i></font>

572
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,770
<font color="yellow">She was Lee Ji Eun's mother.</font>

573
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,300
<font color="yellow">How could it be that on the day she's on
the show that her mother commits suicide?</font>

574
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,920
<font color="yellow">And Lee Ji Eun doesn't know about it.</font>

575
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,260
<font color="yellow">Looks like you'll get
a great dramatic moment again.</font>

576
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,780
<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

577
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,410
<font color="yellow">Did Hye In go somewhere?</font>

578
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,170
<font color="yellow">Give her a call.
She had some business to take care of.</font>

579
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,300
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

580
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,430
<font color="yellow">It will be hectic on the show.</font>

581
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,920
<font color="yellow">It would be better if you could tell her
or Jung Hye In something beforehand.</font>

582
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,560
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say anything on
the show if you don't want to.</font>

583
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,470
<font color="yellow">Like anything about your past
or your personal life.</font>

584
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,090
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Bye.</font>

585
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,390
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

586
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:50,940
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait.</font>

587
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you going around doing this?</font>

588
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,750
<font color="yellow">I thought Director Shin
had talked to all of you.</font>

589
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,150
<font color="yellow">You took photos when Bo Yeon
was being rescued, right?</font>

590
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,650
<font color="yellow">No, when did I do that?</font>

591
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,800
<font color="yellow">Give me that phone.</font>

592
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,900
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to.
- Don't want to?</font>

593
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,860
<font color="yellow">Oh, do you know that person?</font>

594
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,900
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

595
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,380
<font color="yellow">Ten seconds to air.</font>

596
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,510
<font color="yellow">Five, four, three, two, one.</font>

597
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,290
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

598
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:07,220
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

599
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,630
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</font>

600
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,650
<font color="yellow">Put in this caption.</font>

601
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,710
<font color="yellow">Bring in the audience members.</font>

602
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,290
<font color="yellow">Hey, what the...</font>

603
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,580
<font color="yellow">Audience is entering. Read the prompter.</font>

604
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,010
<font color="yellow">Why are there audience members?</font>

605
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,050
<font color="yellow">On other programs you've done,
if you had a guest like this</font>

606
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,540
<font color="yellow">wouldn't you bring in an audience?</font>

607
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,030
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon got hurt because
we did it like this.</font>

608
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,520
<font color="yellow">She nearly died!</font>

609
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,080
<font color="yellow">If Bo Yeon should make us change,
we should've done it with Han Sol's dad.</font>

610
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,280
<font color="yellow">We can't do things for personal reasons.</font>

611
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,440
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, what are you doing?
Say your lines.</font>

612
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,450
<font color="yellow">On today's Jung Hye In's Wanted,
we have 30 audience members with us.</font>

613
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,880
<font color="yellow">Let's welcome the audience members.</font>

614
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,060
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

615
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,110
<font color="yellow">Sit in the back first.</font>

616
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, Shin Dong Wook is going too far.</font>

617
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,350
<font color="yellow">He really is something.</font>

618
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,280
<font color="yellow">Coconut TV, a streamer
is broadcasting a meal.</font>

<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun, a woman in her early 20s,
was kidnapped by a masked man</font>

621
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,980
<font color="yellow">during a live webcast.</font>

622
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:58,320
<font color="yellow">That was three days before my son
Hyun Woo was kidnapped.</font>

623
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,780
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper Park Sae Yong
had met Lee Ji Eun online</font>

624
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,570
<font color="yellow">and they had been dating.</font>

625
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,730
<font color="yellow">Three days later...</font>

626
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,220
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong disguised himself</font>

627
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,750
<font color="yellow">as a P.A. on my movie's set
and took my son.</font>

628
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,220
<font color="yellow">On the day this show started...</font>

629
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,130
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong was found hanging
by a noose in his own home.</font>

630
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,930
<font color="yellow">The demands to make this show
and the second mission</font>

631
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,910
<font color="yellow">were delivered to me by Lee Ji Eun
who was initially thought to be a victim.</font>

632
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,130
<font color="yellow">Also, the target of the first mission,
Kim Han Sol's father.</font>

633
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,770
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun was found at
his murder scene and was arrested.</font>

634
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,450
<font color="yellow">This is the seventh mission.</font>

635
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,150

637
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,680
<font color="yellow">Start with audience questions.</font>

638
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,320
<font color="yellow">Today, we will start with questions
from the studio audience.</font>

639
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,200
<font color="yellow">I was a fan ever since you were on
the Africa TV food broadcast.</font>

640
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,990
<font color="yellow">I read an article that Park Sae Yong
was paying you to date him.</font>

641
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,070
<font color="yellow">I heard that the Coconut TV program was
a bit racy so that you could earn money.</font>

642
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,330
<font color="yellow">Was the kidnapping all
just a ploy for money too?</font>

643
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,670
<font color="yellow">No, it was not.</font>

644
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:39,780
<font color="yellow">Did you and Park Sae Yong kidnap
Hyun Woo together because of money?</font>

645
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,330
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

646
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,540
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is an accomplice.</font>

647
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,480
<font color="yellow">When you provoke her like that,
you are provoking the culprit.</font>

648
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,220
<font color="yellow">It's my show.
If you don't like it, then leave!</font>

649
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,690
<font color="yellow">I don't care about standards or whatever.</font>

650
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,990
<font color="yellow">A person almost died
because of your work.</font>

651
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,220
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you change things
for the sake of that one person?</font>

652
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,190
<font color="yellow">You can leave with him if you want.</font>

653
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,260
<font color="yellow">No, I can't leave.</font>

654
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,510
<font color="yellow">This is my show too.</font>

655
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,860
<font color="yellow">This time I will ask a question.</font>

656
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,770
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun.</font>

657
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,840
<font color="yellow">Why did the culprit send a picture
of your family with the mission?</font>

658
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,190
<font color="yellow">I will ask a different question.</font>

659
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,060
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago...</font>

660
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,040
<font color="yellow">there was a person who
claimed to be your father's friend.</font>

661
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:49,550
<font color="yellow">I heard that he used you to
skillfully threaten your father.</font>

662
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,060
<font color="yellow">Do you know the reason why?</font>

663
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,160
<font color="yellow">I have a question for Jung Hye In.</font>

664
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,000
<font color="yellow">You are with an accomplice
to your son's kidnapper.</font>

665
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,210
<font color="yellow">How can you be so calm?</font>

666
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,120
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to pardon this person
by showing us she has a sad past?</font>

667
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,110
<font color="yellow">Did you make this entire thing up
to save your husband's station?</font>

668
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,170
<font color="yellow">Is this whole thing fake?</font>

669
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,320
<font color="yellow">Let's follow the order
of the program and...</font>

670
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,630
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, don't
take any more questions.</font>

671
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,780
<font color="yellow">We'll go to commercials.
Let's get this under control.</font>

672
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,120
<font color="yellow">Camera three, it's not time
for commercials yet.</font>

673
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,140
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, you have
to get through this.</font>

674
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,300
<font color="yellow"><i>This is how the viewers
really feel about you.</i></font>

675
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,420
<font color="yellow">See if you can change
these people's hearts.</font>

676
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,840
<font color="yellow">I live in this area.</font>

677
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:22,690
<font color="yellow">Today, I saw a woman commit suicide
by jumping off the UCN building.</font>

678
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,810
<font color="yellow">What? Suicide?</font>

679
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,970
<font color="yellow">It's 6,400 won.</font>

680
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,860
<font color="yellow">Someone seemed to have
committed suicide over there.</font>

681
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,050
<font color="yellow">Did you see it?</font>

682
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,670
<font color="yellow">That woman? Yes, I saw it.</font>

683
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,820
<font color="yellow">Why? In the daytime...</font>

684
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,940
<font color="yellow">Did you get a picture or video,
by any chance?</font>

685
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,700
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that? So scary.</font>

686
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,960
<font color="yellow">I just needed it for something.</font>

687
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,550
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Bye.</font>

688
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,700
<font color="yellow">Excuse me!</font>

689
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,640
<font color="yellow">I have a picture on my phone.</font>

690
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,290
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

691
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,320
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

692
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,650
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Is it a blackout?</font>

693
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,450
<font color="yellow">- Look into it now!
- Okay.</font>

694
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,200
<font color="yellow">Damn!</font>

695
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,510
<font color="yellow"><i>I apologize to all our viewers.</i></font>

696
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,470
<font color="yellow">Where did Lee Ji Eun go?</font>

697
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,180
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

698
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,610
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

699
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,610
<font color="yellow">Was she kidnapped?</font>

700
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,250
<font color="yellow">Captain, there was a blackout
and Lee Ji Eun disappeared.</font>

701
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,010
<font color="yellow">Chief, are you watching the show?</font>

702
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:13,740
<font color="yellow">The police are keeping the UCN building
contained and investigating.</font>

703
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,640
<font color="yellow">Once again, I want to apologize
to all the viewers.</font>

704
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,190
<font color="yellow">There was a brief blackout in
the studio for unknown reasons.</font>

705
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,390
<font color="yellow">Our show could not air during that time.</font>

706
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,680
<font color="yellow">And my son...</font>

707
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,000
<font color="yellow">The accomplice to his kidnapping...</font>

708
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:37,000
<font color="yellow">The seventh mission target, Lee Ji Eun,
has disappeared during that blackout.</font>

709
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,780
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, calm down.</font>

710
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,910
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.
There is still time left in our show.</font>

711
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,130
<font color="yellow">You have to take questions
from the audience by yourself.</font>

712
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,210
<font color="yellow">You have to finish the show.</font>

713
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,370
<font color="yellow">The seventh mission is complete with
the appearance of Lee Ji Eun on our show.</font>

714
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:21,120
<font color="yellow">For the remaining time,
I will take questions from the audience.</font>

715
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,320
<font color="yellow">Go on, please.</font>

716
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,770
<font color="yellow">As of yesterday...</font>

717
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:35,370
<font color="yellow">you were looking for a connection between
several people from seven years ago.</font>

718
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,100
<font color="yellow">Have you discovered what happened
seven years ago yet?</font>

719
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,220
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

720
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,970
<font color="yellow">- No one can leave yet.
- Let me go!</font>

721
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,250
<font color="yellow">You were with Lee Ji Eun the longest
and you were there for the blackout.</font>

722
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,580
<font color="yellow">The only person who knows who
has Hyun Woo has disappeared.</font>

723
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,120
