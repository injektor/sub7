39

<font color="yellow">It wasn't suicide.</font>

to look like suicide.</font>

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,040
<font color="yellow">Is it about what the kidnapper
is trying to expose?</font>

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,190
<font color="yellow">About what happened seven years ago.</font>

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

44
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,530

Director Shin Dong Wook the truth...</font>

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,780
<font color="yellow">I was hired to do it.</font>

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,500

seven years ago?</font>

and covered it up.</font>

and now they're trying to kill me.</font>

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
<font color="yellow">Whether I get caught by the police

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,320
<font color="yellow">The accident yesterday was
caused by them too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Who do you suppose that is?</font>

58
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,120
<font color="yellow">Is it by chance...</font>

59
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,340
<font color="yellow">Han Sol's father was working on research
for a large company seven years ago.</font>

60
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,320
<font color="yellow">So, he was an assistant professor of
veterinary science seven years ago?</font>

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,380
<font color="yellow">Back then...</font>

62
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,770
<font color="yellow">I think he was researching something
an external company requested.</font>

63
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,920
<font color="yellow">He was designated as
the research team leader.</font>

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,180
<font color="yellow">That's all I remember.</font>

65
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,230
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

66
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,120
<font color="yellow"><i>I believe that external company
was the SG Group.</i></font>

67
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,140
<font color="yellow"><i>The funds were deposited into
the professor's personal account.</i></font>

68
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,630
<font color="yellow"><i>The amount was very large.</i></font>

69
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,360
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't think it was official research.</i></font>

70
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,770
<font color="yellow"><i>Lee Ji Eun's father worked at SG Group
from 2006 to 2009.</i></font>

71

<font color="yellow"><i>We haven't been able to confirm
which department yet or the position.</i></font>

72
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,990
<font color="yellow">All of the targets or accomplices
are somehow related to SG Group.</font>

73
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,010
<font color="yellow">Then the people who ordered the hit on
Na Jae Hyun and my husband...</font>

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,140
<font color="yellow">are you saying it could be SG Group?</font>

75
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,300
<font color="yellow">How could that be? He was family.</font>

76
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,250
<font color="yellow">My late husband would often say
his family was so inhumane.</font>

77
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,000
<font color="yellow">It broke his heart.</font>

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,400
<font color="yellow">Still, they want to maintain
their power and strength.</font>

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,470
<font color="yellow">They are very protective of their family.</font>

80
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,910
<font color="yellow">We will look into it.</font>

81
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,140
<font color="yellow">Is SG Group at the center of it all?</font>

82
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,280
<font color="yellow">Or is there someone else behind it
who is connected to everything?</font>

83
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,080
<font color="yellow">Now there's only one person left who
knows what happened seven years ago.</font>

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,470
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is the only one left.</font>

85
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,470
<font color="yellow">That's why the kidnapper...</font>

86
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,110
<font color="yellow">Then was it never in his plans
to put Lee Ji Eun on the show?</font>

87
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,610
<font color="yellow">I think that is highly likely.</font>

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,000
<font color="yellow">I think he is getting impatient.</font>

89
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,510
<font color="yellow">He is changing his plans in order
to expose the important points.</font>

90
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,400
<font color="yellow">If only I could find out more
about Lee Ji Eun...</font>

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
<font color="yellow">This is our chance to get
ahead of the kidnapper.</font>

92
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,610
<font color="yellow">If Lee Ji Eun talks about SG Group today</font>

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,330
<font color="yellow">that will be following
the culprit's plan</font>

94
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,010
<font color="yellow">but Hyun Woo will be in danger.</font>

95
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,630
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper will want to finish
the remaining three episodes.</font>

96
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,630
<font color="yellow">But, SG will want to disrupt this show.</font>

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,080
<font color="yellow">I don't know what
the kidnapper is planning.</font>

98
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,860
<font color="yellow">However, if she doesn't talk
about SG and returns to prison...</font>

99
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,700
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun may end up
murdered like Ha Dong Min.</font>

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,650
<font color="yellow">Help me, Lieutenant.</font>

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,790
<font color="yellow">We need to hide Lee Ji Eun.</font>

102
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,690

Lieutenant Cha Seung In's home.</font>

103

<font color="yellow">The Lieutenant's home?</font>

104
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,420
<font color="yellow">Things should be going crazy
because of Lee Ji Eun.</font>

105
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,410
<font color="yellow">Check to see if Lee Ji Eun is there.</font>

106
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,990
<font color="yellow">Don't harm Jung Hye In or the lieutenant.</font>

107
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,350
<font color="yellow">Just check for now.</font>

108
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,500

114
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,520
<font color="yellow">Well, he's saying
there's a leak downstairs.</font>

115
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,700
<font color="yellow">He insisted he needs to check now.</font>

116
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,820
<font color="yellow">The grandmother downstairs said that?</font>

117
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,470
<font color="yellow">She didn't mention that to me.</font>

118
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,560
<font color="yellow">Oh, he says he's her grandson.</font>

119
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,230
<font color="yellow">It will me take just a moment.</font>

120
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,080
<font color="yellow">I just want to see if I need to call
a repairman tomorrow.</font>

121
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,070
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

122
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,500
<font color="yellow">Do you know where the leak is?</font>

123
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,630
<font color="yellow">Can I check the bathroom?</font>

124
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,280
<font color="yellow">It might not be a good idea now...</font>

125
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

126

127
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,470

128
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,390
<font color="yellow">Can you please leave?</font>

129
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,570
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

130
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,310
<font color="yellow">I guess it might not be the bathroom.</font>

131
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,710
<font color="yellow">I will check tomorrow.</font>

132
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,680

Why don't we leave now?</font>

135
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,980
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go now.</font>

136
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,770
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here.</font>

137
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,400
<font color="yellow">We need to move to a safer location.</font>

138
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,770
<font color="yellow">There's a place we can go to.</font>

139
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,760
<font color="yellow">I go there before I start a new project,
or when I need to rest.</font>

140
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,660
<font color="yellow">Both my manager and my husband
don't know about it.</font>

141
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,910
<font color="yellow">There's nothing in Jung Hye In's bag.</font>

142
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,910
<font color="yellow">She figured out that we were
following her and tricked us.</font>

143
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, just wait for now.</font>

144
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,860
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

145
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,990

146
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,240

147
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,260
<font color="yellow">What brings you by
so late without even a call?</font>

148
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

149
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,810
<font color="yellow">I had something urgent
to discuss with you.</font>

150
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,380
<font color="yellow">Please sit.</font>

151
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,810
<font color="yellow">Did you see the show?</font>

152
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,890
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun disappeared.</font>

153
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,660
<font color="yellow">- Have you found her?
- No.</font>

154
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,510
<font color="yellow">But, I think I found a lead.</font>

155
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,100
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

156
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,340
<font color="yellow">Someone has been tailing me
since I left the station.</font>

157
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,840
<font color="yellow">They followed me all the way here.</font>

158
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,480
<font color="yellow">Who and why would they do such a thing?</font>

159
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,980
<font color="yellow">It must be the people
who are after Lee Ji Eun.</font>

160
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,310
<font color="yellow">They mistakenly think that I have her.</font>

161
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,600
<font color="yellow">It could be the kidnapper.</font>

162
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,610
<font color="yellow">Or they could be the people the kidnapper
is trying to expose from seven years ago.</font>

163
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,480
<font color="yellow">So, how is this a lead for you?</font>

164
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,660
<font color="yellow">I've told the police
that they are following me.</font>

165
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,170
<font color="yellow">They are coming up with
a plan to catch them.</font>

166
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,140
<font color="yellow">If it is the kidnapper,
we will be able to identify him better.</font>

167
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,370
<font color="yellow">If they're the ones trying
to cover up the truth...</font>

168
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,050
<font color="yellow">then we will learn more about
the kidnapper's motives.</font>

169
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,110
<font color="yellow">I have heard that SG Group
has a better intelligence unit</font>

170
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,390
<font color="yellow">than the government.</font>

171
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,440
<font color="yellow">I was hoping you could
look into it for me.</font>

172
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

173
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,910
<font color="yellow">There are people tailing Jung Hye In.</font>

174
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,120
<font color="yellow">I would like you to look into
who they are right away.</font>

175
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,690
<font color="yellow">I understand what you are saying.</font>

176
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,380
<font color="yellow">I apologize. We will withdraw for today.</font>

177
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,960
<font color="yellow">Look at the email that
Professor Kim Woo Jin saved.</font>

178
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
<font color="yellow">It was sent to Lee Yong Hwan.</font>

179
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,490
<font color="yellow">That's Lee Ji Eun's father,
who worked at SG Group.</font>

180
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,380
<font color="yellow">It wasn't an SG email account.
It was a personal account.</font>

181
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,450
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

182
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,750
<font color="yellow">His research funds were also
deposited into a personal account.</font>

183
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,430
<font color="yellow">Professor Kim Woo Jin was
doing research for SG</font>

184
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,650
<font color="yellow">that the public couldn't know about.</font>

185
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,880
<font color="yellow">The person in charge of
that project was Lee Yong Hwan.</font>

186
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,820
<font color="yellow">After that, Lee Yong Hwan suffered
depression and alcoholism.</font>

187
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,160
<font color="yellow">He ended up committing suicide.</font>

188
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,850
<font color="yellow">Professor Kim Woo Jin was targeted
by Hyun Woo's kidnapper...</font>

189
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,410
<font color="yellow">But, I don't think it was only
because he was abusing his son.</font>

190
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was because of the incident
related to Na Jae Hyun seven years ago.</font>

191
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,440
<font color="yellow">Then, what about Ha Dong Min?</font>

192
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,470
<font color="yellow">It's not the illegal human testing.</font>

193
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,500
<font color="yellow">He has a connection
to what happened then.</font>

194
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,270
<font color="yellow">By the way, have you seen Lieutenant Cha?</font>

195
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,890
<font color="yellow">Have you heard from him?</font>

196
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,350
<font color="yellow">You haven't spoken to him?</font>

197
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,640
<font color="yellow">Cha Seung In, where are you?</font>

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,550
<font color="yellow">I was about to call you.</font>

199
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,370
<font color="yellow">I'm going to send you an address,
so meet me there.</font>

200
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Young Gwan.</font>

201
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,010
<font color="yellow">I'll explain it in person.</font>

202
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,180
<font color="yellow">You said my mom didn't commit suicide.</font>

203
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,360
<font color="yellow">Are you certain?</font>

204
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,610
<font color="yellow">I won't be sure until
the autopsy report comes back.</font>

205
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,330
<font color="yellow">Who killed her?</font>

206
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,090
<font color="yellow">Was it them?</font>

207
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,990
<font color="yellow">SG?</font>

208
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
<font color="yellow">There were police stationed
everywhere in the station.</font>

209
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,450
<font color="yellow">How could you let Lee Ji Eun get away?</font>

210
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,170
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to ask you.</font>

211
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,870
<font color="yellow">Where is the emergency generator?</font>

212
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,790
<font color="yellow">Also, who knows how to use it?</font>

213
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,410
<font color="yellow">And who destroyed it in advance?</font>

214
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,970
<font color="yellow">Who would be able to take Lee Ji Eun
during the blackout and duck the police?</font>

215
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,350
<font color="yellow">Who would that be?</font>

216
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,530
<font color="yellow">It has to be this team.</font>

217
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,090
<font color="yellow">At the very least,
it has to be someone within UCN.</font>

218
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,300
<font color="yellow">We heard it all already,
but let's go over it again.</font>

219
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,410
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon, it was confirmed that
you were in the studio.</font>

220
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,710
<font color="yellow">Director Shin, the engineer confirmed
that you were in the booth.</font>

221
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,910
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi?</font>

222
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,040
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

223
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,150
<font color="yellow">I told you I was in the hallway.</font>

224
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,390
<font color="yellow">No one can confirm that though.</font>

225
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,290
<font color="yellow">I was on the phone with Bo Yeon.</font>

226
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,560
<font color="yellow">I showed you the time stamp earlier.</font>

227
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,090
<font color="yellow">Even if one of you did it,
I'm sure you planned ahead of time.</font>

228
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,840
<font color="yellow">There is probably an accomplice
that helped.</font>

229
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,190
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun could have been here.</font>

230
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,490
<font color="yellow">Then it is the job of the police</font>

231
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,780
<font color="yellow">to figure out how
the accomplice got inside.</font>

232
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,580
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Or...</font>

233
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
<font color="yellow">You should have caught
Na Soo Hyun by now.</font>

234
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,100
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't sit around suspecting us</font>

235
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,750
<font color="yellow">and repeating the same thing
over and over.</font>

236
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,790
<font color="yellow">It might not be the kidnapper
that took Lee Ji Eun.</font>

237
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,960
<font color="yellow">He wanted Lee Ji Eun on the show
and for her to reveal something.</font>

238
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,400
<font color="yellow">It may have been someone
who feared that happening.</font>

239
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,460
<font color="yellow">One of the people trying to cover up
what happened seven years ago?</font>

240
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,290
<font color="yellow">It's good and all to theorize.</font>

241
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,940
<font color="yellow">We'll have to confirm
your movements for today.</font>

242
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,910
<font color="yellow">Please cooperate if you
want to go back to work.</font>

243
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,870
<font color="yellow">Director Shin, come with me.</font>

244
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,690
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi, go with
Detective Yoo.</font>

245
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,350
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon, please wait a moment.</font>

246
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,880
<font color="yellow">We need to retrace
your movements for the day.</font>

249
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,200
<font color="yellow">I thought maybe you were sleeping,
so I wasn't going to call.</font>

250
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,390
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

251
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,240
<font color="yellow">Are you in pain?</font>

252
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,380
<font color="yellow">Should I go there?</font>

253
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,650
<font color="yellow">No, I'm a lot better now.</font>

254

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,690

<font color="yellow">I can't do it anymore.</font>

261
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,710
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

262
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,700
<font color="yellow">You should quit if you can't do it.</font>

263
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,450
<font color="yellow">It's not like I don't
understand how you feel.</font>

how can all of you be like this?</font>

<font color="yellow">I trusted in your plan.</font>

295
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
<font color="yellow">My brother and my younger sister.</font>

296
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,870
<font color="yellow">And how they died.</font>

297
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,670
<font color="yellow">I wanted everyone to know about it.</font>

298
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,770
<font color="yellow">I believed that they would
pay for what they did!</font>

299
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,070
<font color="yellow">I'm going to follow our original plan.</font>

300
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,440
<font color="yellow">Save Ji Eun some other way.</font>

301
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,670
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Choi, are you okay?</font>

302
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,260
<font color="yellow">I called a designated driver.
You just need to get in the car.</font>

303
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,990
<font color="yellow">Why can't you get the timing right?
What's with you kids?</font>

304
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,840
<font color="yellow">Are you the designated driver?
Hurry up!</font>

305
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,390
<font color="yellow">Gangnam-gu, Cheongdamdong 278-1.</font>

306
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,750
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Drive him home carefully.</font>

307
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,320
<font color="yellow">Call us once you drop him off.</font>

308
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,790
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

309
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,340
<font color="yellow">What is this? Who are you?</font>

310
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,620
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun?</font>

311
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
<font color="yellow">You're the one who killed Jo Nam Chul.</font>

312
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,280
<font color="yellow">What is all of this? Untie me.</font>

313
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,750
<font color="yellow">Untie me right now!</font>

314
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,000
<font color="yellow">Be quiet!</font>

315
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,080
<font color="yellow">Stop the car, you punk! Stop the car!</font>

316
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,510
<font color="yellow">Stay put.</font>

317
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to kill you.</font>

318
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,210
<font color="yellow">Stop the car, you punk!</font>

319
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,100
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

320
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,330
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is here.</font>

321
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,490
<font color="yellow">My mom ended up dying because of me.</font>

322
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,560
<font color="yellow">Just like my dad.</font>

323
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,690
<font color="yellow">It's not too late now.</font>

324
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,170
<font color="yellow">Tell me where Hyun Woo is.</font>

325
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,330
<font color="yellow">Tell me who is behind
it all and this will end.</font>

326
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,950
<font color="yellow">If it ends like this,
this will have all been for nothing.</font>

327
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,500
<font color="yellow">Don't try to get information out of me.</font>

328
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to use you.</font>

329
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,090

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,350

to protect you too?</font>

333
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,790
<font color="yellow">The best way for him to get you back...</font>

334
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,190
<font color="yellow">it would be to give me
a mission to bring you back.</font>

335
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,930
<font color="yellow">I don't know what the mission is yet.</font>

336
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,710
<font color="yellow">I'll go and see what it is.
You can make your decision then.</font>

337
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,890
<font color="yellow">I don't know what his goal is.</font>

338
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,870
<font color="yellow">Don't think that it's more
important than your own life.</font>

339
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,720
<font color="yellow">It's South Wonhyo Bridge.
The mission is inside the car.</font>

340
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,300
<font color="yellow">Meet me there now.</font>

344
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,830
<font color="yellow">He's alive.</font>

345
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,310
<font color="yellow">This is South Wonhyo Bridge.</font>

346
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,100
<font color="yellow">Someone was been kidnapped
and he's lost consciousness.</font>

347
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! Are you okay?</font>

348
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,270
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

349
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,190
<font color="yellow">This person, Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

350
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,050
<font color="yellow">He got a scholarship from SG Group.</font>

351
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,180
<font color="yellow">Then he finished training.</font>

352
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,420
<font color="yellow">He's been representing SG since
he started at the law firm Ohsung.</font>

353
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,020
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy to look into
his background in one day.</font>

354
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,750
<font color="yellow">There's no other way, but we need
to get him to confess like Ha Dong Min.</font>

355
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,990
<font color="yellow">Security and his law firm, Ohsung,
are all there at the hospital.</font>

356
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,140
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Park and Detective Yoo
are there too.</font>

357
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,150
<font color="yellow">I told you we shouldn't
have taken him to the hospital.</font>

358
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,690
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper took Choi Pil Kyu and
put him there without killing him.</font>

359
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,940
<font color="yellow">It meant we should have kept him
there restrained.</font>

360
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,790
<font color="yellow">Whatever the kidnapper wanted</font>

361
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,150
<font color="yellow">we can't take part in
forceful confinement.</font>

362
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,890
<font color="yellow">Let's think about it.
There must be a way.</font>

363
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,160
<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

364
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,620
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

365
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,080
<font color="yellow">I haven't received proof
that Hyun Woo is alive yet.</font>

366
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,330
<font color="yellow">I hadn't even thought of that yet.</font>

367
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,840
<font color="yellow">We're only doing this
show because of Hyun Woo.</font>

368
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,050
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu only worked on
SG Group while at Ohsung.</font>

369
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,960
<font color="yellow">Two years before Jo Nam Chul was paroled,
he represented him, as well.</font>

370
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,170
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu seems to have visited often.</font>

371
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,740
<font color="yellow">He's a lawyer. He's very famous.</font>

372
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,370
<font color="yellow">He works for the law firm, Ohsung.</font>

373
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,390
<font color="yellow">I guess they represent violent
criminals sometimes too.</font>

374
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,310
<font color="yellow">The law firm, Ohsung.</font>

375
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,770
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul couldn't possibly
have that much money.</font>

376
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,460
<font color="yellow">I think it must've been a girlfriend or
friend who got him the lawyer.</font>

377
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,400
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul was intent on getting parole.</font>

378
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,370
<font color="yellow">He was on almost
perfect behavior for two years.</font>

379
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know what caused that change.</font>

380
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,680
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul claimed that Im Hyung Soon,
Na Jae Hyun, and Senior Sang Shik...</font>

381
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,690
<font color="yellow">were all killed because
he was hired to kill them.</font>

382
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,260
<font color="yellow">Senior Sang Shik was looking into
Na Jae Hyun's disappearance.</font>

383
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,350
<font color="yellow">That's when Jo Nam Chul killed him.</font>

384
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Why do you think Detective Kim Sang Shik
was looking into my brother's case?</i></font>

385
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,850
<font color="yellow"><i>And what do you think he found</i></font>

386
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,380
<font color="yellow"><i>that caused him to die at
the hands of Jo Nam Chul?</i></font>

387
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Find out and expose it before
it's too late, Lieutenant.</i></font>

388
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,420
<font color="yellow">The day after Jo Nam Chul was paroled</font>

389
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,400
<font color="yellow">he told his girlfriend that
he would be going to do a job.</font>

390
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,830
<font color="yellow"><i>[I AM FINALLY GETTING OUT TOMORROW.
I GOT MYSELF A JOB FOR TOMORROW TOO.]</i></font>

391
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,320
<font color="yellow">Where is Jo Nam Chul?</font>

392
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
<font color="yellow">- Are you in touch with him?
- No.</font>

393
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,310
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a cell phone.
He said he'd buy one and call me.</font>

394
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,280
<font color="yellow">I can't reach him.</font>

395
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,700
<font color="yellow">Where did he say he'd be going?</font>

396
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,880
<font color="yellow">He said he was going to work.</font>

397
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,970
<font color="yellow">Then he went out to get some
potassium chloride.</font>

398
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,510
<font color="yellow">He killed Im Hyung Soon.</font>

399
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,550
<font color="yellow"><i>Lawyer Cho Pil Kyu could
have promised Jo Nam Chul parole</i></font>

400

401
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,650
<font color="yellow">About Im Hyung Soon who
Jo Nam Chul killed...</font>

402
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,160
<font color="yellow">He called me telling me
he had a tip for me.</font>

403
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,800
<font color="yellow">I had stopped working on the case.</font>

404
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,290
<font color="yellow">That detective Kim Sang Shik
was asking a lot of questions.</font>

405
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,970
<font color="yellow">All I did is tell him where
he could meet Im Hyung Soon.</font>

406
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,500
<font color="yellow">Im Hyung Soon called in a tip to the
detective who was on Na Jae Hyun's case.</font>

407
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,230
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul was waiting at the place
where Im Hyung Soon was supposed to be.</font>

408
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,670
<font color="yellow">Then seven years ago,
Im Hyung Soon and Jo Nam Chul...</font>

409
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,150
<font color="yellow">I think there's a chance
they were working together</font>

410
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,230
<font color="yellow">when they killed Na Jae Hyun.</font>

411
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:35,180
<font color="yellow">When Im Hyung Soon called in a fake tip
to turn in Jo Nam Chul to the police</font>

412
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,520
<font color="yellow">it was Sang Shik who ended up dying.</font>

413
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,180
<font color="yellow">Im Hyung Soon ran to
the Philippines out of fear.</font>

414
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,710
<font color="yellow">Since he came to Korea after seven years,
he must have had a reason.</font>

415
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,370
<font color="yellow">He must have run out of money.</font>

416
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,860
<font color="yellow">He probably reached out to SG.</font>

417
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,390
<font color="yellow">If SG got threatened,
they'd try to get rid of Im Hyung Soon.</font>

418
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, you need to
approach this very carefully.</font>

419
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,140
<font color="yellow">You don't have any irrefutable
evidence or witnesses.</font>

420
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,730
<font color="yellow">If you go at this the wrong way,
you'll be in a lot of danger.</font>

421
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,910
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

422
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,060
<font color="yellow">What brings you by?</font>

423
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,520
<font color="yellow">I'd like to speak to
Lieutenant Cha Seung In.</font>

424
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,210
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better?</font>

425
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,500
<font color="yellow">It must still be very hard for you.</font>

426
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,280
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

427
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,940
<font color="yellow">Actually...</font>

428
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,780
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

429
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,590
<font color="yellow">Last night, Na Soo Hyun
snuck into my hospital room.</font>

430
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,820
<font color="yellow">He asked me to give this to you.</font>

00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,760
<font color="yellow">Let's assume Choi Pil Kyu
can't appear on today's show.</font>

439
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,180
<font color="yellow">We can find evidence that
will get him legally punished.</font>

440
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,080
<font color="yellow">That's not enough.</font>

441
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,140
<font color="yellow">The mission was to get him punished.</font>

442
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,970
<font color="yellow">He needs to get arrested
or atone for it.</font>

443
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,100
<font color="yellow">We need those results today.</font>

444
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,320
<font color="yellow">That's difficult unless
he's caught in the act of a crime.</font>

445
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,410
<font color="yellow">And it's something that
happened seven years ago.</font>

446
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,770
<font color="yellow">I'm certain he's connected to the people
that have appeared so far.</font>

447
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,000
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

448
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,690
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

449
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,100
<font color="yellow">I'm President Ham Tae Suk of SG Life.</font>

450
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,030
<font color="yellow">What brings you by?</font>

451
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,080
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit late saying hello.</font>

452
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,540
<font color="yellow">I ended up acquiring UCN
because of this show.</font>

453
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,810
<font color="yellow">You are all working so hard
to look for our Hyun Woo.</font>

454
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,350
<font color="yellow">I had some things to prepare,
so I could not come right away.</font>

455
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,170
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by prepare?</font>

456
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,610
<font color="yellow">I have been watching the show.</font>

457
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,370
<font color="yellow">I know you feel you had no choice
because of the kidnapper.</font>

458
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,120
<font color="yellow">But, I feel the show has many issues.</font>

459
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,240
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you plan on controlling
the content of the show?</font>

460
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,170
<font color="yellow">What do I know,
that I would do such a thing?</font>

461
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,590
<font color="yellow">If a problem arises,
I will help you to resolve it.</font>

462
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,290
<font color="yellow">I am Kim Sang Woo from
the law firm Ohsung.</font>

463
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,120
<font color="yellow">Our team will be handling legal issues
for UCN and the Wanted show.</font>

464
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,270
<font color="yellow">If you get any lawsuits
or any other legal issues</font>

465
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,330
<font color="yellow">these people here
will take care of it for you.</font>

466
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,840
<font color="yellow">We will take care of ourselves.</font>

467
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,130
<font color="yellow">If there is something to take
responsibility for, we will.</font>

468
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,430
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

469
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,380
<font color="yellow">UCN will have to start getting used to
SG's way of doing things.</font>

470
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,970
<font color="yellow">We will do our very best.</font>

471
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,210
<font color="yellow">We hope you will do your best, as well.</font>

472
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,480
<font color="yellow">Honestly, it can be a burden if
the risk is too high for us.</font>

473
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,180
<font color="yellow">We are getting ready for lawsuits
from some organizations already.</font>

474
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,920
<font color="yellow">Also, isn't the broadcast team
on the list of suspects?</font>

475
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,110
<font color="yellow">There are issues with President Song too.</font>

476
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,110
<font color="yellow">We are short on time just
getting ready for the show.</font>

477
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,620
<font color="yellow">Keep the meeting as short as possible
to give them time to get ready.</font>

478
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

479
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,400
<font color="yellow">Should we go over what
the current situation is?</font>

480
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,840
<font color="yellow">You can keep sleeping.</font>

481
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,740
<font color="yellow">I won't go anywhere.</font>

482
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,160
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go.</font>

483
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,800
<font color="yellow">I really have nowhere now.</font>

484
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,680
<font color="yellow">So, tell us.</font>

485
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,930
<font color="yellow">Who is Hyun Woo's kidnapper?</font>

486
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,960
<font color="yellow">I can't ruin that person's plan now.</font>

487
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,470
<font color="yellow">Even if this person uses you
and throws you aside like this?</font>

488
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,910
<font color="yellow">He's not like that.</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

513
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,470
<font color="yellow">I really don't know.</font>

514
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,200

<font color="yellow">I really don't know this woman.</font>

520
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,580
<font color="yellow">But, I was promised.</font>

521
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,910

Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu isn't it?</font>

523
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,920
<font color="yellow">So, you knew?</font>

524
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,200
<font color="yellow">Do you know the entire plan?</font>

525
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,650
<font color="yellow">Just up to today.</font>

526
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,910

a very important day.</font>

527
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,710
<font color="yellow">Can you bring me some paper?</font>

528
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,880
<font color="yellow">This is a storage locker my mom rented.</font>

529
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,680
<font color="yellow">This is the unit number and pin number.</font>

530
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:48,300
<font color="yellow">You'll find some of my dad's belongings
that he left for her before he died.</font>

531
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,690
<font color="yellow">What are they?</font>

532
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,520
<font color="yellow">Go and look for a tape.</font>

533
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,700
<font color="yellow">You'll find some notes
that my dad left too.</font>

534
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,480
<font color="yellow">You have to complete this mission
in order to keep Hyun Woo safe.</font>

535
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,760
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you this.</font>

536
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,390
<font color="yellow">This is everything I can do for you.</font>

537
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,620
<font color="yellow">Is the investigation over?</font>

538
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,230
<font color="yellow">You must be tired.</font>

539
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,920
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

540
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,000
<font color="yellow">Our president has an urgent matter
he'd like to discuss with you.</font>

541
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,820
<font color="yellow">President?</font>

542
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,800
<font color="yellow">Are you from SG?</font>

543
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,650
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

544
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Song Jung Ho.</font>

545
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,680
<font color="yellow">How did you know about this place?</font>

546
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,500
<font color="yellow">Do you think there's anything
I don't know about you?</font>

547
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,720
<font color="yellow">There's no need to do that.</font>

548
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,600
<font color="yellow">Did someone contact you and tell you
that I have Lee Ji Eun?</font>

549
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,790
<font color="yellow">You can do whatever you want.</font>

550
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,590
<font color="yellow">But, do not cause trouble with SG.</font>

551
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,310
<font color="yellow">President Song Jung Ho came by.</font>

552
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,920
<font color="yellow">We'll need to move her.</font>

553
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be right there.</font>

554
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,800
<font color="yellow">Young Gwan, keep looking
into Ha Dong Min.</font>

555
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,540
<font color="yellow">Look into the circumstances of
his suicide once more.</font>

556
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,850
<font color="yellow">Senior! Where are you going again?</font>

557
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,580
<font color="yellow">And where is Senior Mi Ock?</font>

558
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,040
<font color="yellow">Where are you going now?</font>

559
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,840
<font color="yellow">You're acting strange lately.</font>

560
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,750
<font color="yellow">Are you meeting someone secretly?</font>

561
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going to buy cigarettes.</font>

562
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,610
<font color="yellow">I can't even get a girlfriend
with you guys around.</font>

563
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,020
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you about it
once I figure everything out.</font>

564
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,950
<font color="yellow">It's not a situation
I want to drag you into.</font>

565
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,680
<font color="yellow">It can cause a lot of problems.</font>

566
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,670
<font color="yellow">Still, Senior...</font>

567
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,480
<font color="yellow">I will explain it to you eventually.
I'll call you regularly.</font>

568
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,450
<font color="yellow">Look into Ha Dong Min and wait, okay?</font>

569
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

570
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,700
<font color="yellow">He's going to call SG.</font>

571
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,580
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here for now.
Lieutenant Cha is on his way here.</font>

572
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,230
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

573
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,110
<font color="yellow">I told you I won't run.</font>

574
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,610
<font color="yellow">I know but I still have to do it.</font>

575
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,810
<font color="yellow">It will make it harder for us
to move together.</font>

576
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,850
<font color="yellow">You know it'll be more dangerous
for you to run, right?</font>

577
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,950
<font color="yellow">Let's use the emergency exit stairs.</font>

578
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,920
<font color="yellow">I'll go inside.
Wait near Jung Hye In's car.</font>

00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:01,700
<font color="yellow">He probably didn't tell anyone
in case Ji Eun got discovered.</font>

587
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,690
<font color="yellow">There were two of them there.</font>

588
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,740
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun will try
to avoid getting caught too.</font>

589
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,900
<font color="yellow">We did get out first.</font>

590
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,840
<font color="yellow">He's probably called for back-up now.</font>

591
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,730
<font color="yellow">Where are we going now?</font>

592
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,420
<font color="yellow">There are a few places I know
that we use for witness protection.</font>

593
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,380
<font color="yellow">I need to think about which place is
the least exposed and best hidden.</font>

594
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,110
<font color="yellow">I have a place I want to visit first.</font>

595
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,570
<font color="yellow">Where is that?</font>

596
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,830
<font color="yellow">We should get to somewhere safe...</font>

597
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,100
<font color="yellow">A place that might help us
complete today's mission.</font>

598
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,340
<font color="yellow">I don't think hiding like
this will solve anything.</font>

599
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,040
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun...</font>

600
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,400
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun.</font>

601
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,230
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha.</font>

602
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,990
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

603
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,680
<font color="yellow">You should go to Ji Eun.</font>

604
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,880
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen to me.</font>

605
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,690
<font color="yellow">I did kill a person too.</font>

606
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,210
<font color="yellow">A man here has been stabbed.
He's in critical condition.</font>

607
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:11,690
<font color="yellow">Gangseo-gu, Banghwa-dong 960.
It's an underground parking lot. Hurry!</font>

608
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,870
<font color="yellow">It was some people that SG Group sent.</font>

609
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,470
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

610
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,030
<font color="yellow">Hold on a little longer.</font>

611
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,970
<font color="yellow">The ambulance will be here soon.</font>

612
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

613
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,730
<font color="yellow">Now...</font>

614
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,890
<font color="yellow">it will all end soon.</font>

615
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,720
<font color="yellow">Tell me, Na Soo Hyun.</font>

616
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,370
<font color="yellow">Who is behind this?</font>

617
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,640
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

618
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,040
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you.</font>

619
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,850
<font color="yellow">Our Young Hyun.</font>

620
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,970
<font color="yellow">She died such an unfair death.</font>

621
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,160
<font color="yellow">Young Hyun?</font>

622
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,700
<font color="yellow">Your little sister?</font>

623
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,140
<font color="yellow">Not Na Jae Hyun?</font>

624
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,190
<font color="yellow">A six year old baby...</font>

625
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,340
<font color="yellow">When she smiled...</font>

626
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,110
<font color="yellow">she was so pretty.</font>

627
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,070
<font color="yellow">She just died.</font>

628
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,470
<font color="yellow">I heard about it while I was in the army.</font>

629
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,680
<font color="yellow">I thought the sky was falling.</font>

630
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,510
<font color="yellow">It felt like she died because
I couldn't protect her.</font>

631
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,640
<font color="yellow">Up until then...</font>

632
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,220
<font color="yellow">I felt like I hadn't even
done anything for her.</font>

633
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,690
<font color="yellow">And my brother?</font>

634
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,880
<font color="yellow">My brother found the people
who did that to her.</font>

635
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,880
<font color="yellow">My brother ended up dying.</font>

636
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:04,850
<font color="yellow">The detective who tried to find
my brother ended up dying.</font>

637
