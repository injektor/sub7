<font color="yellow"><i>[EPISODE 12]</i></font>

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
<font color="yellow">I'll go alone from here.</font>

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,310
<font color="yellow">Will you be okay?</font>

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,680
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time before we air.</font>

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,150
<font color="yellow">I think we risk exposure if
the three of us stick together.</font>

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,050
<font color="yellow">Call someone from your team
or Lieutenant Cha</font>

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="yellow">and don't go anywhere alone.</font>

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,500
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,890
<font color="yellow">Let me know when you find a safe place.</font>

10
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,030
<font color="yellow">I can't have any more complications.</font>

12
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,720
<font color="yellow"><i>If anything happens to me,
send this to a TV station or a newspaper.</i></font>

13
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,750
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry to put this burden on you.</i></font>

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,030
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.</i></font>

15
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,070
<font color="yellow">It seems like they've determined
that Ha Dong Min committed suicide.</font>

16
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,170
<font color="yellow">The autopsy report isn't out yet.</font>

17
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,190
<font color="yellow">What about the CCTV inside the prison?</font>

18
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,840
<font color="yellow">The precinct is being very uncooperative.</font>

19
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,840
<font color="yellow">We're not in charge
of this investigation</font>

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
<font color="yellow">so we have no jurisdiction.</font>

21
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,910
<font color="yellow">Do you have any time?</font>

22
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,470
<font color="yellow">I have some questions I want to ask.</font>

23
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,860
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm really busy right now.
Come down to see me.</i></font>

24
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,400
<font color="yellow">You're a great teacher there.</font>

25
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,850
<font color="yellow">I heard you didn't join the
investigation team and I wondered why.</font>

26
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,490
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how to investigate
anything officially?</font>

27
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,390
<font color="yellow">Did you look into it?</font>

28
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,140
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to ask me.</font>

29
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,570
<font color="yellow">It's been bothering me ever
since Park Sae Yong's death</font>

30
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,230
<font color="yellow">so I looked into it.</font>

31
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,420
<font color="yellow">Was it suicide?</font>

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,740
<font color="yellow">They're trying to push the investigation
in that direction and close the case.</font>

33
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,470
<font color="yellow">The medical examiner in charge told me
unofficially that it could be murder.</font>

34
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,840
<font color="yellow">Is that for sure?</font>

35
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,500
<font color="yellow">The spot where he was positioned
with the noose around his neck</font>

36
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,260
<font color="yellow">is different than where
the strangulation is.</font>

37
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,080
<font color="yellow">He has multiple strangulation
marks on his throat.</font>

38
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,430
<font color="yellow">He has defensive wounds
on his hands and feet.</font>

39
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,870
<font color="yellow">The crime scene photos show his pants
and shirt rolled up on one side.</font>

40
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,200
<font color="yellow">It probably happened when was dragged
across the floor after being strangled.</font>

41
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,970
<font color="yellow">When will there be official results?</font>

42
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,470
<font color="yellow">We already have the results</font>

43
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,980
<font color="yellow">but they're delaying
to look for evidence.</font>

44
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,700
<font color="yellow">They're trying to prove it was suicide.</font>

45
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,820
<font color="yellow">Who could be ordering
them to do such a thing?</font>

46
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,630
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,860
<font color="yellow">But, be careful.</font>

48
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,550
<font color="yellow">I heard Chief Jung is being
disciplined right now.</font>

49
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,540
<font color="yellow">If something happens to you,
he won't be able to help you.</font>

50
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,150
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you.
I'll call you again.</font>

51
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,720
<font color="yellow">Don't call me.
I don't like hearing from you.</font>

52
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,270
<font color="yellow">Senior, can't you just tell me?</font>

53
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,150
<font color="yellow">Who killed Na Soo Hyun and
how did you know to go there?</font>

54
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,950
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to keep secrets from you.</font>

55
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,880
<font color="yellow">This isn't because I don't trust you.</font>

56
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
<font color="yellow">Then why won't you tell me?</font>

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,460
<font color="yellow">I don't want to drag you into this.</font>

58
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,250
<font color="yellow">You might end up having to quit,
and it's dangerous.</font>

59
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,050
<font color="yellow">Then what is it that I can do?</font>

60
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,900
<font color="yellow">Tell me that, at least.</font>

61
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,190
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

62
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,740
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper doesn't know
that Na Soo Hyun is dead.</font>

63
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
<font color="yellow">He'll worry if he doesn't hear from him
and that Lee Ji Eun is missing too.</font>

64
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,920
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

65
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,970
<font color="yellow">Let's find out who he is today.</font>

66
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,010
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

67
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,410
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun didn't start all this
just because of his brother.</font>

68
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,330
<font color="yellow">No, his brother Na Jae Hyun got involved
because of his sister Na Young Hyun.</font>

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,420
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that Na Young Hyun died
of an illness two years before all that?</font>

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,820
<font color="yellow">Let's start from there.</font>

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,240
<font color="yellow">Find out how she died
and look into her medical records.</font>

72
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,410
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

73
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jung Hye In.
Where are you?</font>

74
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,730
<font color="yellow">I'm at the station now.
Lieutenant Oh is with Lee Ji Eun.</font>

75
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,680
<font color="yellow">She said she'd find a place
and contact me.</font>

76
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,390
<font color="yellow">What happened to Na Soo Hyun?</font>

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,070
<font color="yellow">He was killed... by them.</font>

78
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,630
<font color="yellow">I was too late.</font>

79
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

80
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,500
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun, Lee Ji Eun,
and Park Sae Yong.</font>

81
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,130
<font color="yellow">Now none of the kidnapper's
accomplices can help him.</font>

82
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,850
<font color="yellow">He will get desperate.</font>

83
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,710
<font color="yellow">He will think he has no time and
his identity may be revealed.</font>

84
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,270
<font color="yellow">We have to move fast.</font>

85
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,000
<font color="yellow">I found a video tape that Lee Ji Eun's
father left before she died.</font>

86
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,950
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look at it
and call you if I find anything.</font>

87
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,890
<font color="yellow">I need to investigate something too.</font>

88
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,380
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,280
<font color="yellow">I think you all comprehend
the situation now.</font>

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,620
<font color="yellow">We have a mountain of issues
besides what I mentioned.</font>

91
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,440
<font color="yellow">You should be prepared to deal
with it personally, as well.</font>

92
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,730
<font color="yellow">Are we finished now?</font>

93
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's only the first meeting.
We'll end it here for now.</font>

94
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,190
<font color="yellow">By the way, what is today's mission?</font>

95
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,880
<font color="yellow">Does it have to do with Choi Pil Kyu,
by any chance?</font>

96
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,560
<font color="yellow">I heard that Jung Hye In found
him by a Han River bridge</font>

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,690
<font color="yellow">and called in last night.</font>

98
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,860
<font color="yellow">It will be difficult if you
continue to be so uncooperative.</font>

99
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,500
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,
I'll say one last thing.</font>

100
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,580
<font color="yellow">You can no longer have your mission
targets appear on your show.</font>

101
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you're
here to resolve issues</font>

102
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="yellow">not control the content?</font>

103
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,080
<font color="yellow">The best way to solve
problems is with prevention.</font>

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,940
<font color="yellow">There was a risk of aiding
and abetting a murderer before.</font>

105
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
<font color="yellow">Even if the person lives</font>

106
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
<font color="yellow">there is the risk of
a defamation lawsuit.</font>

107
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,200
<font color="yellow">There is the issue that this show
has an image that it is immoral.</font>

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,630
<font color="yellow">We will take it into consideration.
Why don't you leave now?</font>

109
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,320
<font color="yellow">Ah, Jung Hye In.</font>

110
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,400
<font color="yellow">I'm Lawyer Kim Sang Woo from Ohsung.</font>

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
<font color="yellow">I think you should know.</font>

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,220
<font color="yellow">Starting today, we will need to know
the structure of the show before it airs.</font>

113
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,580
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute!</font>

114
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,920
<font color="yellow">We didn't discuss that earlier.</font>

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,600
<font color="yellow">This is our president's policy
as per our counsel.</font>

116
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,980
<font color="yellow">You have often acted on your own.</font>

117
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,820
<font color="yellow">You have gone off script
on the air, as well.</font>

118
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,320
<font color="yellow">You even got SG to acquire
UCN on your own.</font>

119
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,640
<font color="yellow">What's your point?</font>

120
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,440
<font color="yellow">We would like you to follow the script
and not act on your own from now on.</font>

121
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,540
<font color="yellow">At times, you will have to
agree to some of our requests.</font>

122
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,460
<font color="yellow">Will that increase my chances
of finding Hyun Woo?</font>

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,780
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

124
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,150
<font color="yellow">You have handed the station over to us,
so you should follow our policies...</font>

125
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,140
<font color="yellow">I can't promise you anything.</font>

126
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,290
<font color="yellow">You can deal with your
management issues on your own.</font>

127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,950
<font color="yellow">How are the preparations going?</font>

128
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,960
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

129
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,010
<font color="yellow">I had something to take care of.</font>

130
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,320
<font color="yellow">I received proof that Hyun Woo is alive.</font>

131
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Woo.</i></font>

132
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I told you not to watch this.</i></font>

133
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,120
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not a good show.</i></font>

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Your mom won't like it either.</i></font>

135
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,910
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon.</font>

136
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,160
<font color="yellow">I wanted to talk to you for a bit.</font>

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,140
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

138
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,960
<font color="yellow">Let's have a meeting once I'm back.</font>

139
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,010
<font color="yellow">If you're hiding something...</font>

140
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,200
<font color="yellow">If it's something we need
for the show, I'll tell you.</font>

141
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
<font color="yellow">I won't stab you in the back
with a live audience</font>

142
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,410
<font color="yellow">like you did to me yesterday.</font>

143
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,280
<font color="yellow">I didn't have time to tell you
and it was a method that worked.</font>

144
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,760
<font color="yellow">If you were able to do a close-up
on a picture on a dead body</font>

145
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,870
<font color="yellow">then didn't some planning go into that?</font>

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,430
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

147
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,600
<font color="yellow">Why are we in the editing room?</font>

148
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,310
<font color="yellow">Do you need to check something?</font>

149
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,890
<font color="yellow">Make this play for me.</font>

150
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,130
<font color="yellow">I'm not good at this stuff.</font>

151
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,190
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

152
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,330
<font color="yellow">I'll look at first and then let you know.</font>

153
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,820
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone yet.</font>

154
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,660
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't.</font>

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,050
<font color="yellow">You just need to press this.</font>

156
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

157
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,750
<font color="yellow">- Bo Yeon.
- Yes?</font>

158
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,470
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure if you'd come back.</font>

159
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,760
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you had to.</font>

160
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,350
<font color="yellow">No, I'm here because I want to be.</font>

161
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,210
<font color="yellow">Don't feel too burdened by it.</font>

162
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

163
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,980
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I just sit like this?</i></font>

164
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,940
<font color="yellow"><i>One moment, please.</i></font>

165
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,530
<font color="yellow"><i>Since 2006...</i></font>

166
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,700
<font color="yellow"><i>I have been working at SG Chemical
in the management support team.</i></font>

167
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,740
<font color="yellow"><i>I've been working in administrations
and my name is Lee Yong Hwan.</i></font>

168
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,740
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i></font>

169
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,450
<font color="yellow"><i>But...</i></font>

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,370
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know if I can really do this.</i></font>

171
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,480
<font color="yellow"><i>I really don't know.</i></font>

172
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,100
<font color="yellow">Since 2008, Professor Kim Woo Jin has
been doing research at Korea University.</font>

173
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,070
<font color="yellow">I have been in charge of
overseeing that research.</font>

174
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,200
<font color="yellow">That research involved legal issues
regarding our products.</font>

175
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,900
<font color="yellow">The law firm Ohsung consulted us on it.</font>

176
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,300
<font color="yellow"><i>I was the intermediary between
Ohsung and the research team.</i></font>

177
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I was in charge of communication.</i></font>

178
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,410
<font color="yellow"><i>The research had to be kept hidden
until we had the results.</i></font>

179
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Unless it was very basic communication,
we did not use email or the phone.</i></font>

180
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,780
<font color="yellow"><i>Communication continued between
the lawyers, SG, and the research team.</i></font>

181
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,300
<font color="yellow"><i>There were many revisions
to the research results.</i></font>

182
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,340
<font color="yellow"><i>As for the research results,
I went directly to the lab.</i></font>

183
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,440
<font color="yellow"><i>I would bring it back in my USB.</i></font>

184
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
<font color="yellow"><i>Even money...</i></font>

185
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,700
<font color="yellow"><i>The company wouldn't deposit it
into the university account.</i></font>

186
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,410
<font color="yellow"><i>It was put into a personal account
and transferred.</i></font>

187
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,070
<font color="yellow"><i>It was deposited into the accounts of the
personal accounts of the researchers.</i></font>

188
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,030
<font color="yellow"><i>As for the documents
or instructions from Ohsung</i></font>

189
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,710
<font color="yellow"><i>I would receive the paperwork directly.</i></font>

190
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,270
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, what did you
talk about with Jung Hye In?</font>

191
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,530
<font color="yellow">She just said she was sorry and
asked if I could keep doing the show.</font>

192
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know if
Bo Yeon should continue...</font>

193
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,290
<font color="yellow">It's her choice. Leave her be.</font>

194
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,590
<font color="yellow">Let's discuss what we should do.
We don't have much time.</font>

195
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,010
<font color="yellow">What can we do to get
Choi Pil Kyu on our show?</font>

196
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,390
<font color="yellow">Is that possible?</font>

197
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,390
<font color="yellow">Do we have something
we can use to make a deal</font>

198
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,900
<font color="yellow">like we did with Ha Dong Min?</font>

199
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,340
<font color="yellow">That was only possible because we
had actual evidence he was guilty.</font>

200
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,970
<font color="yellow">Right now, we can't even meet him and
have nothing to persuade him with.</font>

201
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,720
<font color="yellow">SG is telling us we can't
have him on our show.</font>

202
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,830
<font color="yellow">They keep pressuring us.</font>

203
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,150
<font color="yellow">About this person, Choi Pil Kyu...</font>

204
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,820
<font color="yellow">Is he possibly involved in Na Jae Hyun
and Ham Tae Young's old case?</font>

205
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,570
<font color="yellow">That is what the kidnapper
is trying to expose right now.</font>

206
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,660
<font color="yellow">They're both dead,
so we can't really find out.</font>

207
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,590
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm sorry.</i></font>

208
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,630
<font color="yellow"><i>This is hard to do with a clear head.</i></font>

209
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,000
<font color="yellow"><i>One day, I got a document from Ohsung.</i></font>

210
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,860
<font color="yellow"><i>They had mistakenly left
a note stuck in there.</i></font>

211
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,680
<font color="yellow"><i>It's this here.</i></font>

212
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,240
<font color="yellow"><i>It was written on July 16.</i></font>

213
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,780
<font color="yellow"><i>It's signed by Choi Pil Kyu</i></font>

214
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,040
<font color="yellow"><i>"I took care of it cleanly."</i></font>

215
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,860
<font color="yellow"><i>"The three men won't
be a problem again."</i></font>

216
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,660
<font color="yellow"><i>"Mister Na won't be speaking again."</i></font>

217
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,340
<font color="yellow"><i>"I have found someone to fix it."</i></font>

218
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,320
<font color="yellow"><i>"I will keep an eye on things for now."</i></font>

219
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,740
<font color="yellow"><i>"I took care of it cleanly."</i></font>

220
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,620
<font color="yellow"><i>"The three men won't
be a problem again."</i></font>

221
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,380
<font color="yellow"><i>"Mister Na won't be speaking again."</i></font>

222
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,120
<font color="yellow"><i>"I have found someone to fix it."</i></font>

223
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,910
<font color="yellow"><i>I will keep an eye on things for now.</i></font>

224
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,230
<font color="yellow">Oh. Hye In, you're in here?</font>

225
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,460
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Is something wrong?</font>

226
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,850
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

227
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,770
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

228
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,770
<font color="yellow">How did you endure it?</font>

229
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,450
<font color="yellow">When your wife suddenly passed away.</font>

230
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,300
<font color="yellow">Even when I thought it
was just an accident...</font>

231
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,600
<font color="yellow">I had a hard time.</font>

232
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,080
<font color="yellow">I barely got through it
because of Hyun Woo.</font>

233
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,200
<font color="yellow">But, you...</font>

234
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,050
<font color="yellow">You never even knew why.</font>

235
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,430
<font color="yellow">How did you do it?</font>

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean how?</font>

237
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,060
<font color="yellow">How can anyone endure such a thing?</font>

238
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

239
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,900
<font color="yellow">I can't do anything for you.</font>

240
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,170
<font color="yellow">You were getting
your Ph.D in 2009, right?</font>

241
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,860
<font color="yellow">Is it true that you took part in research
with Professor Kim Woo Jin for SG Group?</font>

242
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,830
<font color="yellow">Your name is written here
in the research logs.</font>

243
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, well it is true.</font>

244
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,500
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

245
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,660
<font color="yellow">If you look at the emails from SG,
there are requests from their lawyers.</font>

246
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,480
<font color="yellow">It looks like they're asking you to
modify research results to suit them.</font>

247
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,070
<font color="yellow">Did that help your thesis?</font>

248
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,460
<font color="yellow">You're right.
Na Young Hyun, six years old.</font>

249
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,220
<font color="yellow">She was admitted to our hospital
nine years ago and died during treatment.</font>

250
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,060
<font color="yellow"><i>[HA DONG MIN]</i></font>

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,020
<font color="yellow">Na Young Hyun's doctor was...</font>

252
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,890
<font color="yellow">Doctor Ha Dong Min?</font>

253
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was.</font>

254
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,530
<font color="yellow">I forgot that he worked here.</font>

255
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,420
<font color="yellow">I don't know much because
I haven't worked here long.</font>

256
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,070
<font color="yellow">I heard a lot about him
when he appeared on Wanted.</font>

257
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,200
<font color="yellow">They say he became very famous</font>

258
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,340
<font color="yellow">when he moved to Soojung Hospital
seven years ago.</font>

259
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,610
<font color="yellow">By the way...
where did you get that video?</font>

260
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,940
<font color="yellow">Lee Yong Hwan died a long time ago
and his wife died too.</font>

261
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,590
<font color="yellow">What is your source?</font>

262
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,750
<font color="yellow">That's kind of hard for me to tell you.</font>

263
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

264
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,980
<font color="yellow">To summarize, Choi Pil Kyu
handled affairs for SG Group.</font>

265
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,160
<font color="yellow">He hired someone to kill
Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun.</font>

266
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,440
<font color="yellow">So, the people that Jo Nam Chul
was talking about was SG Group.</font>

267
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,270
<font color="yellow">The reason that Tae Young
and Na Jae Hyun were meeting...</font>

268
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,760
<font color="yellow">may have to do with that research.</font>

269
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,430
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper is trying
to reveal that SG Group</font>

270
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,100
<font color="yellow">is doing something to kill people.</font>

271
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,080
<font color="yellow">And that they're trying to cover it up.</font>

272
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,940
<font color="yellow">SG already knows about it then.</font>

273
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,680
<font color="yellow">They created that car accident
with Jo Nam Chul on purpose.</font>

274
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,440
<font color="yellow">They were trying to kill him
to keep him quiet.</font>

275
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,020
<font color="yellow">They must have become
more certain after</font>

276
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,600
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young
and Na Jae Hyun's mission.</font>

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,920
<font color="yellow">But, you know when President Song
was going to end the show?</font>

278
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,580
<font color="yellow">Why would they help?</font>

279
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,410
<font color="yellow">They even bought out the station
like Senior Hye In requested.</font>

280
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,210
<font color="yellow">They're probably trying to control
the show however they can.</font>

281
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,020
<font color="yellow">They can shut us down completely
whenever they want to.</font>

282
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,490
<font color="yellow">We need to get Choi Pil Kyu on this show,
no matter what.</font>

283
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,230
<font color="yellow">We can do the show with what we have.</font>

284
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,770
<font color="yellow">We're not a news program
that can just report things.</font>

285
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,840
<font color="yellow">That's not good enough evidence either.</font>

286
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,040
<font color="yellow">The mission was to
give him his punishment.</font>

287
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,740
<font color="yellow">We need to use that
to get him to confess.</font>

288
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,310
<font color="yellow">That's true, but is there a way?</font>

289
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,800
<font color="yellow">We have to use his fear.</font>

290
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,570
<font color="yellow">Make him think that things could be worse
if he doesn't appear on tonight's show.</font>

291
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,590
<font color="yellow">We know what the kidnapper's motive is.</font>

292
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,400
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to find him though?</font>

293
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,170
<font color="yellow">My brother....</font>

294
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:43,160
<font color="yellow">He found the people who
did that to Young Hyun.</font>

295
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,370
<font color="yellow">My brother ended up dying.</font>

296
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:56,150
<font color="yellow">The detective who tried to find
my brother ended up dying.</font>

297
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,660
<font color="yellow">But, I still tried.</font>

298
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,730
<font color="yellow">I lost everything.</font>

299
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,750
<font color="yellow">It was so...</font>

300
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,300
<font color="yellow">painful and torturous.</font>

301
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,850
<font color="yellow">It was just so hard.</font>

302
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,960
<font color="yellow">So, I even tried to forgive them all.</font>

303
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,980
<font color="yellow">But, I couldn't forgive them.</font>

304
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,770
<font color="yellow">No one asked for forgiveness.</font>

305
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,360
<font color="yellow">No one said they had done anything wrong.</font>

306
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,160
<font color="yellow">We need to look for someone around
us with that same motive.</font>

307
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,780
<font color="yellow">Let's eat first, Senior.</font>

308
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,490
<font color="yellow">What if you pass out
before we can catch him?</font>

309
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,990
<font color="yellow">- I'm not hungry.
- Come on!</font>

310
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

311
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,910
<font color="yellow">Don't they need to think
of the show today?</font>

312
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,390
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo needs to be kept safe.</font>

313
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,560
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

314
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,690
<font color="yellow">It's a note that Na Soo Hyun
made Ko Hyung Joon write.</font>

315
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
<font color="yellow">Where did heck did you get this?</font>

316
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,330
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu gave him money
to start his own business?</font>

317
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,410
<font color="yellow">He was probably ordered to
do so by SG Group.</font>

318
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,000
<font color="yellow">Ko Hyung Joon never mentioned this.</font>

319
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,920
<font color="yellow">I went to look for Im Hyung Soon,
but he had fled to The Philippines.</font>

320
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,820
<font color="yellow">I felt like something would happen
to me if I pursued it any further.</font>

321
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,140
<font color="yellow">So, I quit being a detective.</font>

322
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,580
<font color="yellow">My life was ruined
because of Na Soo Hyun.</font>

323
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,420
<font color="yellow">This mission is to punish Choi Pil Kyu
for his crime from seven years ago.</font>

324
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,750
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun sent me this note.</font>

325
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,160
<font color="yellow">Isn't he trying to tell you
to go back and see Ko Hyung Joon?</font>

326
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,230
<font color="yellow">You can hear more from him or
drag him onto to show as a witness.</font>

327
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,070
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to get to work?</font>

328
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,110
<font color="yellow">Young Gwan.</font>

329
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,010
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

330
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,430
<font color="yellow">I think Ko Hyung Joon is in danger.</font>

331
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,530
<font color="yellow">It's someone from SG Group.</font>

332
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,890
<font color="yellow">Chief, we're at Ilsan-dong,
third floor of Jaeil building.</font>

333
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,930
<font color="yellow">It's Ko Hyung Joon's office.</font>

334
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,100
<font color="yellow">He may be confined in there
or even murdered.</font>

335
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,790
<font color="yellow">We're going in now.</font>

336
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,500
<font color="yellow">I'll go in first.</font>

338
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,530
<font color="yellow">That kid tried to kill me!</font>

339
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,630
<font color="yellow">What can we do?</font>

340
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,690
<font color="yellow">I think this time I'm going to kill you.</font>

341
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,900
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell him about Choi Pil Kyu.
No one knows about him.</font>

342
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,140
<font color="yellow">But, what can I do?</font>

343
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,980
<font color="yellow">I think you might talk in the future.</font>

344
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,330
<font color="yellow">That's the problem here.</font>

345
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,670
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong
that you're doing this?</font>

346
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,040
<font color="yellow">All I did was work on a case.</font>

347
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,440
<font color="yellow">I stopped working on it like
I was told and quit my job.</font>

348
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,860
<font color="yellow">That's all I've done.</font>

349
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,660
<font color="yellow">I heard you said it wasn't
enough money and took more.</font>

350
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,190
<font color="yellow">That was the price of your life.</font>

351
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,290
<font color="yellow">Follow me quietly.</font>

352
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,030
<font color="yellow">Stay here!</font>

353
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,340
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

354
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,450
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

355
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,180
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Dong Wook from UCN.</font>

356
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,150
<font color="yellow">I wanted to talk you for a moment.</font>

357
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,580
<font color="yellow">Weren't you people told not
to let any media people in?</font>

358
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,080
<font color="yellow">What's with the poor security?</font>

359
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

360
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,240
<font color="yellow">Should we talk here?</font>

361
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,930
<font color="yellow">We're going to air this video tonight.</font>

362
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,830
<font color="yellow">Then Ohsung and SG will
try to cut tail and run.</font>

363
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,700
<font color="yellow">"He did it on his own and
we never ordered him to do it."</font>

364
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,250
<font color="yellow">That video won't make it on air.</font>

365
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,660
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

366
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,840
<font color="yellow">Suppose it doesn't since UCN
is owned by SG Group.</font>

367
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,580
<font color="yellow">Then I would be forced to send this
to other stations and newspapers.</font>

368
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
<font color="yellow">- What?
- When I do...</font>

369
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,080
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Ohsung and SG
will protect you.</font>

370
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,240
<font color="yellow">Will they say you only
did what you were told?</font>

371
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,140
<font color="yellow">SG Group will be hearing about this too.</font>

372
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,610
<font color="yellow">They will be moving quickly to fix this.</font>

373
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,490
<font color="yellow">Won't you regret this?</font>

374
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,650
<font color="yellow">You'll be turned into a criminal
without the chance to even protest.</font>

375
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,720
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu has to
appear on tonight's show.</font>

376
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,950
<font color="yellow">There has to be a chance
for a confession and arrest.</font>

377
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,310
<font color="yellow">That way we can say
he received his punishment</font>

378
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,670
<font color="yellow">without him dying or getting hurt.</font>

379
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,830
<font color="yellow">I wish you would respect
the advice of the legal team.</font>

380
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,340
<font color="yellow">Please look for another way.</font>

381
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,500
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to find Hyun Woo.</font>

382
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,530
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to know
the real reason he died.</font>

383
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:31,420
<font color="yellow">You told me that UCN would be
helpful to SG's media business.</font>

384
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,920
<font color="yellow">You promised me that, right.</font>

385
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,040
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this to keep that promise.</font>

386
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,320
<font color="yellow">You have to give me Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

387
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,330
<font color="yellow">Whether you make a deal
or cut all ties...</font>

388
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,320
<font color="yellow">that is up for you to decide.</font>

389
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you mean by that.</font>

390
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,630
<font color="yellow">About Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu...</font>

391
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,000
<font color="yellow">there is a witness who says he contracted
assassins to do some work for SG Group.</font>

392
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,610
<font color="yellow">If this incident is not confessed,
but revealed by us...</font>

393
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,360
<font color="yellow">all of this will be exposed.</font>

394
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,160
<font color="yellow">This is the first I've heard of this.</font>

395
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,550
<font color="yellow">We will need an opportunity
to tell the truth.</font>

396
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,220
<font color="yellow">How about we have
Lawyer Kim Sang Woo appear too?</font>

397
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,550
<font color="yellow">We will prepare it so that
Choi Pil Kyu can be legally punished.</font>

398
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,120
<font color="yellow">I will order it.</font>

399
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

400
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,950
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

401
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,020
<font color="yellow">Weren't you guaranteed management rights?</font>

402
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,360
<font color="yellow">Yes. Is something wrong?</font>

403
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,890
<font color="yellow">SG has started to pry into
the direction our show is taking.</font>

404
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,640
<font color="yellow">It's affecting our ability
to complete the missions.</font>

405
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't the legal team taking on the role
that you were supposed to take?</font>

406
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,900
<font color="yellow">You said you would ground this show,
so that it didn't go too far.</font>

407
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,850
<font color="yellow">But, you've never done that once.</font>

408
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,800
<font color="yellow">You've never stopped Director Shin.</font>

409
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,570
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, Lee Ji Eun
was right next to you.</font>

410
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,450
<font color="yellow">Did someone take her or did she run?</font>

411
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,580
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense that you
couldn't feel anything happen?</font>

412
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,650
<font color="yellow">There was a blackout
so I was in a lot of shock.</font>

413
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,840
<font color="yellow">There is no reason for Jung Hye In
to take Lee Ji Eun.</font>

414
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,790
<font color="yellow">Why is it that you
always call Cha Seung In</font>

415
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,750
<font color="yellow">instead us when something is wrong?</font>

416
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,070
<font color="yellow">Are you even trying to find Hyun Woo?</font>

417
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,730
<font color="yellow">That's something I should ask you.</font>

418
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,870
<font color="yellow">Have you made any progress
in your investigation?</font>

419
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,750
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

420
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,560
<font color="yellow">When he closed his case on Na Jae Hyun,
he received money from Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

421
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,940
<font color="yellow">He's willing to make a statement
on the show tonight if you need.</font>

422
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,310
<font color="yellow">Are you no longer a cop?
Are you in broadcasting now?</font>

423
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,850
<font color="yellow">This isn't even your case,
so why do you keep hanging around!</font>

424
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,040
<font color="yellow">Because we need to secure
Hyun Woo's safety first.</font>

425
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,780
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it now so leave.</font>

426
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:33,070
<font color="yellow">I've figured out what it is that
the kidnapper wants to reveal.</font>

427
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,960
<font color="yellow">I know why your late husband...</font>

428
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,310
<font color="yellow">and Na Jae Hyun met.</font>

429
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,630
<font color="yellow">And why they had to die...</font>

430
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,110
<font color="yellow">So, it was because of that?</font>

431
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,710
<font color="yellow">That's why Hyun Woo was kidnapped?</font>

432
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,140
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to know about it.</font>

433
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,220
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to find out.</font>

434
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,750
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,280
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about Na Soo Hyun?</font>

437
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,840
<font color="yellow">I just talked to Lieutenant Cha.</font>

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,300
<font color="yellow">He was killed by those people.</font>

440
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,680
<font color="yellow">Something is very wrong here.</font>

441
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,710
<font color="yellow">You didn't want things to go this far.</font>

442
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,580
<font color="yellow">Even if we find Hyun Woo now,
we can still expose the things you want.</font>

443
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,650
<font color="yellow">If you can't tell me who's behind this,
tell me who that woman is.</font>

444
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,210
<font color="yellow">That woman who is with Hyun Woo now.</font>

445
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,010
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

446
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,890
<font color="yellow">I really don't know that.</font>

447
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,030
<font color="yellow">Eighth day of the show.</font>

448
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,830
<font color="yellow">Cracks forming in the team yesterday.
Focus on any changes today.</font>

449
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,370
<font color="yellow">Right now, I am doing extra research into
the personal lives of the broadcast team.</font>

450
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,350
<font color="yellow">If the kidnapper got
what he wanted today</font>

451
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,190
<font color="yellow">do you think he could return Hyun Woo?</font>

452
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,680
<font color="yellow">Nothing is guaranteed.</font>

453
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,490
<font color="yellow">There are still two episodes left.</font>

454
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,820
<font color="yellow">He has even killed people.</font>

455
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,160
<font color="yellow">He might not just stop
at letting people know.</font>

456
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,260
<font color="yellow">These are Lee Yong Hwan's
meeting and work logs from SG.</font>

457
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,910
<font color="yellow">It could be evidence.</font>

458
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,090
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

459
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,980
<font color="yellow">These are emails between the
research team and Professor Kim Woo Jin</font>

460
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

461
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,820
<font color="yellow">Once we're done with the show,
watch the documentaries Joon Gu made.</font>

462
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,520
<font color="yellow">If you watch the Legend series,
he can do things I could never do.</font>

463
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,060
<font color="yellow">Something that Director Shin
could never do...</font>

464
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,250
<font color="yellow">A completely different show.</font>

465
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,660
<font color="yellow">We need something.</font>

466
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,190
<font color="yellow">Here you go.
I organized all the files.</font>

467
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,010
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

468
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,340
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon?</font>

469
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,060
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

470
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
<font color="yellow">Do you think our show will be okay?</font>

471
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,800
<font color="yellow">We just have to do it.</font>

472
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,730
<font color="yellow">We'll do what we can.</font>

473
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,250
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

474
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,260
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu, what are you doing?</font>

475
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,730
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about
bringing in an audience today.</font>

476
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,510
<font color="yellow">I won't. That's not the concept today.</font>

477
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,850
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?
You look neurotic.</font>

478
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,320
<font color="yellow">I heard lawyers from Ohsung
are coming on the show.</font>

479
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, so?</font>

480
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,740
<font color="yellow">You'll need this.</font>

481
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,810
<font color="yellow">It's Lee Ji Eun's mother
trying to blackmail SG Group.</font>

482
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,010
<font color="yellow">What does this have
to do with Choi Pil Kyu?</font>

483
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,560
<font color="yellow">Listen to the lawyer talking and
turn it on at the right time.</font>

484
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,970
<font color="yellow">The viewers will like it.</font>

485
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,800
<font color="yellow">I need to know what's going to be said
and what the intent is.</font>

486
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you know about media play
or fudging the truth a bit?</font>

487
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,170
<font color="yellow">You're pretty good at it,
using it here and there.</font>

488
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,860
<font color="yellow">Gosh, of all things now.</font>

489
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,890
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look and see if it's useful.</font>

490
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,130
<font color="yellow">Shin Dong Wook!</font>

491
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,710
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

492
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,180
<font color="yellow">Don't get upset.</font>

493
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,450
<font color="yellow">I'll decide what to use or not.</font>

494
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,240
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

495
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,750
<font color="yellow">You've investigated the broadcast
team quite a bit, right?</font>

496
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,380
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

497
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,260
<font color="yellow">If the kidnapper is on the team,
who do you think it would be?</font>

498
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,730
<font color="yellow">Do you have something?</font>

499
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,510
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just wondering if
I'm overlooking something.</font>

500
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,270
<font color="yellow">You really are stubborn, you know.</font>

501
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,140
<font color="yellow">There's no one that's a clear suspect
for me to start an investigation on.</font>

502
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,930
<font color="yellow">Looking at motive, actions,
and circumstance</font>

503
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,550
<font color="yellow">I think Director Shin and
Executive Director Choi are likely.</font>

504
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:37,380
<font color="yellow">Do any of them have family members
who died suddenly or got ill?</font>

505
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,810
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon is a single mother
and her daughter isn't very strong.</font>

506
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,010
<font color="yellow">She seems to visit the hospital often.</font>

507
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,750
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi's wife
died eight years ago.</font>

508
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,400
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

509
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,600
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.
I'll tell you when I'm sure.</font>

510
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,450
<font color="yellow">Tell me right away if you have something.</font>

511
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,640
<font color="yellow">I'm only sharing in case
you have a lead.</font>

512
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,170
<font color="yellow">We're really running out of time now.</font>

513
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

514
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,090
<font color="yellow"><i>I think you must be mistaken.</i></font>

515
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,830
<font color="yellow"><i>What mistake?</i></font>

516
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,860
<font color="yellow"><i>First, my husband died like that.</i></font>

517
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,440
<font color="yellow"><i>I've barely been able to make a living.</i></font>

518
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,350
<font color="yellow"><i>Now, look at what's
happened to my daughter.</i></font>

519
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,120
<font color="yellow"><i>How am I supposed to live now?</i></font>

520
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,720
<font color="yellow"><i>You don't even know anything for certain.
You shouldn't threaten us like this.</i></font>

521
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,010
<font color="yellow"><i>However, you are a family member
of our former employee.</i></font>

522
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,870
<font color="yellow"><i>This is to help you out.</i></font>

523
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,910
<font color="yellow">It looks like Lee Ji Eun's mother
went to demand money.</font>

524
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,270
<font color="yellow">Then it looks like she's leaving
without incident.</font>

525
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,910
<font color="yellow">That...</font>

526
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,530
<font color="yellow">I know. It's been edited.</font>

527
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,730
<font color="yellow">Are you using it?</font>

528
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,170
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

529
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:39,194
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by DramaFever</font>

530
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,690
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper said that
the target had to punished.</font>

531
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,690
<font color="yellow">Something worse could happen
live on air today.</font>

532
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,220
<font color="yellow">Everyone needs to be on guard.</font>

533
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,070
<font color="yellow">Keep a close watch on any path
that goes outside from the studio.</font>

534
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

535
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:15,440
<font color="yellow">If Tae Young died an unfair death,
I need to straighten things out now.</font>

536
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,540
<font color="yellow">I took care of it cleanly.</font>

537
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,950
<font color="yellow">The three men won't be a problem again.</font>

538
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,140
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

539
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,160
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

540
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,730
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</font>

541
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,230
<font color="yellow"><i>First, I would like to address
the trouble we had on last night's show.</i></font>

542
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,150
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to offer my sincere apologies.</i></font>

543
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,560
<font color="yellow"><i>As for the accomplice Lee Ji Eun,
who escaped during the blackout</i></font>

544
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,620
<font color="yellow"><i>the police are doing everything
that they can to find her.</i></font>

545
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,830
<font color="yellow">Last night, we received
the eighth mission.</font>

546
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,040
<font color="yellow">The target of this mission
is Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

547
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,310
<font color="yellow">He was found kidnapped, passed out,
and confined in his car.</font>

548
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,040
<font color="yellow">He was taken to the hospital right away,
where he received treatment.</font>

549
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,270
<font color="yellow">Let's keep today's mission simple
and get through it.</font>

550
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,810
<font color="yellow">The point of all of this trying to
figure out what SG is covering up.</font>

551
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,760
<font color="yellow">I told you before
when I checked the script.</font>

552
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,450
<font color="yellow">We need two people battling it out,
at the very least.</font>

553
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,770
<font color="yellow">Our show isn't some
sort of news documentary.</font>

554
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,570
<font color="yellow">It's not up to me what
the kidnapper wants to do.</font>

555
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,440
<font color="yellow">If we complete the mission,
then Hyun Woo will be safe.</font>

556
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,580
<font color="yellow">Let's proceed with the mission first
and then discuss it.</font>

557
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,720
<font color="yellow">We don't know how things will work out.</font>

558
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,440
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I don't know
how things will work out.</font>

559
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,510
<font color="yellow">You might do something like
you did last time.</font>

560
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,900
<font color="yellow">I can't accept you acting on your own
like that any longer.</font>

561
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,090
<font color="yellow">I can't predict what's going
to happen right now either.</font>

562
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,650
<font color="yellow">Stop getting mad about what
hasn't happened and just work.</font>

563
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,610
<font color="yellow">The crime that Lawyer Choi Pil Kyu
committed seven years ago.</font>

564
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,600
<font color="yellow">What could it be?</font>

565
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:37,450
<font color="yellow">This morning we received a video
from an anonymous source.</font>

566
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,650
<font color="yellow"><i>It was written on July 16.</i></font>

567
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,450
<font color="yellow"><i>It's signed by Choi Pil Kyu</i></font>

568
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,420
<font color="yellow"><i>I took care of it cleanly.</i></font>

569
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,170
<font color="yellow"><i>The three men won't be a problem again.</i></font>

570
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Mister Na won't be speaking again.</i></font>

571
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
<font color="yellow"><i>I have found someone to fix it.</i></font>

572
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,130
<font color="yellow"><i>I will keep an eye on things for now.</i></font>

573
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,480
<font color="yellow">The note in the video sent to
us revealed something to us.</font>

574
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,990
<font color="yellow">Surprisingly, it answered
the questions we have had</font>

575
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,080
<font color="yellow">as we've been doing missions.</font>

576
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:18,120
<font color="yellow">My late husband Ham Tae Young's
car accident.</font>

577
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:22,850
<font color="yellow">As well as the remains we
found that were of Na Jae Hyun.</font>

578
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,600
<font color="yellow">If the witness statement
we heard is true...</font>

579
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,370
<font color="yellow">And if that note was really
written by Choi Pil Kyu...</font>

580
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:40,330
<font color="yellow">seven years ago in 2009</font>

581
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,980
<font color="yellow">he conspired to murder
Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun.</font>

582
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,310
<font color="yellow">These are the hit men
who were hired to kill them.</font>

583
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,220
<font color="yellow">One of them is Jo Nam Chul</font>

584
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,860
<font color="yellow">who appeared on our show
as the target of the third mission.</font>

585
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,470
<font color="yellow">The other is Im Hyung Soon,
who was murdered by Jo Nam Chul.</font>

586
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,730
<font color="yellow">You have to go on now.</font>

587
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,560
<font color="yellow">What is Choi Pil Kyu planning to say?</font>

588
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,050
<font color="yellow">There is strong evidence
against him, so...</font>

589
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,700
<font color="yellow">I don't think he will completely deny it.</font>

590
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,010
<font color="yellow">SG will acknowledge
they ordered the murder.</font>

591
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,450
<font color="yellow">He'll say he didn't hire
them to murder himself.</font>

592
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,550
<font color="yellow">Ohsung ordered it internally and
he was only delivering the message.</font>

593
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,370
<font color="yellow">Ohsung agreed to take the blame?</font>

594
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,190
<font color="yellow">Ohsung needs to save SG
and they need to survive too.</font>

595
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,850
<font color="yellow">He's going to be too loyal.</font>

596
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,890
<font color="yellow">SG will say they never
received that message.</font>

597
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,840
<font color="yellow">Then won't SG get out of this?</font>

598
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,500
<font color="yellow">We have round two with SG.</font>

599
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,640
<font color="yellow">We have to get Choi Pil Kyu arrested
in order to succeed with the mission.</font>

600
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,700
<font color="yellow">We are aiming to get at the truth
and get the facts straight.</font>

601
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,190
<font color="yellow">We have decided to give Choi Pil Kyu
the opportunity to defend himself.</font>

602
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,170
<font color="yellow">However, Choi Pil Kyu
is a party to the case.</font>

603
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,790
<font color="yellow">There is a very good chance he would
lie in order to look innocent.</font>

604
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,890
<font color="yellow">We have a lawyer from
his law firm, Ohsung.</font>

605
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,680
<font color="yellow">He is here to tell us
the entire truth about this case.</font>

606
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,260
<font color="yellow">Ask Choi Pil Kyu the first question.</font>

607
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,790
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Hye In, get it together.</i></font>

608
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Start the questions.</i></font>

609
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,870
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

610
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,940
<font color="yellow">Do you admit to the charges made
at you in the video we just saw?</font>

611
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,390
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

612
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,450
<font color="yellow">Then can you please
explain what happened?</font>

613
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,560
<font color="yellow">That note in the video is a fake.</font>

614
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:42,660
<font color="yellow">Neither SG Group of Ohsung have
ever hired anyone to carry out a murder.</font>

615
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,080
<font color="yellow">I have never been
involved in such a thing.</font>

616
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,250
<font color="yellow">Don't listen to anything he says.
Move onto Ohsung.</font>

617
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,680
<font color="yellow">Your law firm said that you could
reveal the facts of this case.</font>

618
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,890
<font color="yellow">- Is Choi Pil Kyu correct?
- Yes.</font>

619
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,040
<font color="yellow">The man in the video is Lee Yong Hwan.</font>

620
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,720
<font color="yellow">He worked at SG Chemical
from 2006 to 2009.</font>

621
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,930
<font color="yellow">His claims have no credibility.</font>

622
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,730
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

623
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:29,140
<font color="yellow">From 2007 to 2009, he was
not an employee with integrity.</font>

624
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,540
<font color="yellow">Especially in 2009</font>

625
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,770
<font color="yellow">he could not work properly
due to alcoholism and depression.</font>

626
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,800
<font color="yellow">He was eventually fired.</font>

627
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,770
<font color="yellow"><i>He was very spiteful about
being fired and spread rumors.</i></font>

628
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,690
<font color="yellow"><i>He even threatened SG employees
and blackmailed them for money.</i></font>

629
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:51,420
<font color="yellow"><i>Because Lee Yong Hwan had mental issues,
we decided not to pursue a lawsuit.</i></font>

630
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,970
<font color="yellow">Can you prove all of that?</font>

631
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:04,260
<font color="yellow">I do have records of a lawsuit that
we had been preparing against him.</font>

632
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,950
<font color="yellow">I can show it to you if needed.</font>

633
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,180
<font color="yellow">- Also...
- What else is there?</font>

634
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,800
<font color="yellow">I have a video for you.</font>

635
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,280
<font color="yellow">I submitted it before the show.</font>

636
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,970
<font color="yellow">Lee Yong Hwan's wife used
the videos that he left behind.</font>

637
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,170
<font color="yellow">It's a video of her using it
to demand money from us.</font>

638
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,130
<font color="yellow">Can you please play it?</font>

639
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,380
<font color="yellow">- Don't play it.
- Play it.</font>

640
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,540
<font color="yellow">Shin Dong Wook!</font>

641
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,430
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

642
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,510
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

643
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,020
<font color="yellow">Lee Yong Hwan is
the father of Lee Ji Eun</font>

644
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,540
<font color="yellow">the kidnapper's accomplice.</font>

645
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:02,810
<font color="yellow">So, that woman in the video jumped
off the building and committed suicide.</font>

646
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,740
<font color="yellow">That is Lee Ji Eun's mother.</font>

647
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,090
<font color="yellow">Can we trust the statement
of a person like that?</font>

649
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,590
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, I'm going
to play an audio file.</font>

650
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,890
<font color="yellow">This story was all Ohsung's idea.</font>

651
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,470
<font color="yellow"><i>What does this have
to do with Choi Pil Kyu?</i></font>

652
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Listen to the lawyer talking and
turn it on at the right time.</i></font>

653
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,850
<font color="yellow"><i>The viewers will like it.</i></font>

654
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:01,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I need to know what's going
to be said and what the intent is.</i></font>

655
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't you know about media play
or fudging the truth a bit?</i></font>

656
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,630
<font color="yellow">This audio file that you just heard
was from before the show.</font>

657
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,900
<font color="yellow">That was President Song delivering
Ohsung's demands to our show's director.</font>

658
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,630
<font color="yellow">We weren't making demands.</font>

659
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,570
<font color="yellow">Since our evidence does
not match what is being said...</font>

660
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,450
<font color="yellow">I will ask another guest to come out.</font>

661
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,990
<font color="yellow">It's better to show people
what SG has been doing.</font>

662
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,690
<font color="yellow">And to show them making their claims.</font>

663
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,790
<font color="yellow">Rather than trying to
prove that it's all a lie.</font>

664
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,590
<font color="yellow">Was that your plan from the start?</font>

665
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,910
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you consult us?</font>

666
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,710
<font color="yellow">I only needed to do it if Ohsung
didn't follow the plan.</font>

667
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,010
<font color="yellow">- Ko Hyung Joon.
- Yes.</font>

668
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,720
<font color="yellow">You came to me after
Na Soo Hyun threatened you.</font>

669
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,470
<font color="yellow">You delivered the fifth mission to me.</font>

670
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,730
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

671
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,330
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago,
you were a police detective.</font>

672
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,460
<font color="yellow">You were in charge of Na Jae Hyun's
missing person's case.</font>

673
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

674
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,230
<font color="yellow">At the time...</font>

675
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:03,120
<font color="yellow">you closed down your case at the order
of the late commissioner, Lee Tae Kyun.</font>

676
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,870
<font color="yellow">I heard you quit your job too.
Is that correct?</font>

677
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,120
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

678
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,520
<font color="yellow">Is there another side of the story,
beside what I just said?</font>

679
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,090
<font color="yellow">I was able to quit back then because...</font>

680
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,100
<font color="yellow">I was able to quit back then because
Choi Pil Kyu came to visit me.</font>

681
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,170
<font color="yellow">He gave me 100 million won.</font>

682
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,460
<font color="yellow">That's him right there?</font>

683
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,140
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's him.</font>

684
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:50,960
<font color="yellow">I was just a detective with
a small salary, and I was tired.</font>

685
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,340
<font color="yellow">I had no desire to investigate.</font>

686
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,490
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was greedy for money too.</font>

687
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,070
<font color="yellow">I've thought about it a lot.</font>

688
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,880
<font color="yellow">What if I had investigated
that case properly?</font>

689
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:14,060
<font color="yellow">If only I had felt a responsibility to
the victim, this wouldn't have happened.</font>

690
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

691
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,220
<font color="yellow">I am truly sorry.</font>

692
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,600
<font color="yellow">According to Ko Hyung Joon</font>

693
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,270
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu tried to shut down
the Na Jae Hyun case.</font>

694
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,370
<font color="yellow">So, he bribed a detective.</font>

695
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,610
<font color="yellow">- Get up.
- What is this?</font>

696
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,810
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

697
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,090
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

698
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,930
<font color="yellow">Let me go!</font>

699
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,950
<font color="yellow">There is a team of police
waiting outside.</font>

700
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:59,290
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu will be arrested on the spot
and will undergo investigation.</font>

701
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,820
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

702
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,460
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Just follow us.</font>

703
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,960
<font color="yellow">Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

704
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,760
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for conspiracy to
murder Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun</font>

705
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,090
<font color="yellow">and for bribery of a police detective.</font>

706
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Make Choi Pil Kyu pay for the crime
he committed seven years ago.</i></font>

707
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,370
<font color="yellow"><i>We have now completed the eighth mission.</i></font>

708
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,860
<font color="yellow">Now, that we have completed
the eighth mission</font>

709
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:40,070
<font color="yellow">we have figured out what the kidnapper
wants us to discover through this show.</font>

710
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,070
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

711
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,310
<font color="yellow">we still have many questions.</font>

712
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,170
<font color="yellow">I'm going to use the bathroom.</font>

713
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,980
<font color="yellow">Why would SG Group do such a thing?</font>

714
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,230
<font color="yellow">Why would they kill their
own family, Ham Tae Young?</font>

715
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,160
<font color="yellow">As well as Na Jae Hyun?</font>

716
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,130
<font color="yellow">The night of July 12, 2009.</font>

717
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,880
<font color="yellow">Why did Ham Tae Young
and Na Jae Hyun meet?</font>

718
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,580
<font color="yellow"><i>Also, Professor Kim Woo Jin
from the first mission.</i></font>

719
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,810
<font color="yellow"><i>And Ha Dong Min from the second mission.
How are they involved?</i></font>

720
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,840
<font color="yellow">We have received help from the police.</font>

721
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,400
<font color="yellow">They have helped us figure out
Hyun Woo's kidnapper's motive.</font>

722
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,120
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun wanted to get revenge on
those who killed his brother and sister.</font>

723
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,340
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun was pained
by her father's death</font>

724
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,140
<font color="yellow">and wanting the world to know the truth.</font>

725
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,830
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper may
be like these accomplices.</font>

726
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,870
<font color="yellow">He may have lost a loved one
