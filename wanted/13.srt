00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,710
<font color="yellow">I think Senior Joon Gu is the kidnapper.</font>

4
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,950
<font color="yellow">His wife died eight years ago.</font>

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,770
<font color="yellow">She was seven months pregnant
and no one knew the cause.</font>

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,940
<font color="yellow">If this has something do with
what happened seven years ago</font>

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,770
<font color="yellow">it all makes perfect sense.</font>

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,610
<font color="yellow">He knows all about broadcasting.</font>

9
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,400
<font color="yellow">He was near me and able to observe me.</font>

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,030
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun was able to get
a call out to the kidnapper.</font>

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,670
<font color="yellow">Right after that,
Executive Director Choi disappeared.</font>

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,340
<font color="yellow">Why didn't I know?</font>

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,620
<font color="yellow">He was right next to me.</font>

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,440
<font color="yellow">Why? Why didn't I know?</font>

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,660
<font color="yellow">I was suspicious even after
Jo Nam Chul died.</font>

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,020
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,480
<font color="yellow">It wasn't your fault.</font>

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,920
<font color="yellow">No, it was my fault.</font>

19
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,420
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who lost him.</font>

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,040
<font color="yellow">It was me who...</font>

21
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,470
<font color="yellow">We know who the kidnapper is now.</font>

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,170
<font color="yellow">We need to find him
as quickly as possible.</font>

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,220
<font color="yellow">I'm going to find Hyun Woo.</font>

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,390
<font color="yellow">I promised you, didn't I?</font>

25
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,220
<font color="yellow">I will find him.</font>

26
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,720
<font color="yellow">I should go find Jung Hye In.</font>

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,050
<font color="yellow">Let me call first.</font>

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,410
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,640
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu?</font>

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,680
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Joon Gu?</font>

31
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,690
<font color="yellow">Has something happened to him?</font>

32
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,190
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon, turn on some highlights.
I'll be right back.</font>

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,910
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

34
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,730
<font color="yellow">Did the two of you know?</font>

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,320
<font color="yellow">About Joon Gu taking Hyun Woo...</font>

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,950
<font color="yellow">How did you know, Dong Wook?</font>

37
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,200
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu just called me.</font>

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,510
<font color="yellow">He said to finish the rest of the show.</font>

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,130
<font color="yellow">He wants you to reveal that SG Group
ordered people to kill Na Soo Hyun.</font>

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,520
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, he says he doesn't
know what he might do.</font>

42
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,740
<font color="yellow">I can't do this anymore.</font>

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,380
<font color="yellow">How can I stand in front
of a camera right now?</font>

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,620
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo... we need to go look for him.</font>

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,850
<font color="yellow">Let's go look for Hyun Woo!</font>

46
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,060
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, look at me.</font>

48
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,030
<font color="yellow">You have to do this.</font>

49
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,290
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu will be watching the show.</font>

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,080
<font color="yellow">He will want to do the remaining
episodes the way he intends.</font>

51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,440
<font color="yellow">So, he will do what he says.</font>

52
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,100
<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,170
<font color="yellow">Director Shin is correct.</font>

54
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,000
<font color="yellow">The show...</font>

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,320
<font color="yellow">you must do it.</font>

56
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,040
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi is acting out
because Na Soo Hyun has died.</font>

57
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,230
<font color="yellow">You need to finish the show in order
for us to find Hyun Woo safely.</font>

58
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,010
<font color="yellow"><i>Soo Hyun is dead.</i></font>

59
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,980
<font color="yellow"><i>The people from SG killed him.</i></font>

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,020
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyun!</font>

61
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,290
<font color="yellow">You know me, don't you?</font>

62
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,920
<font color="yellow">I've seen you before.</font>

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,410
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you've seen me?</font>

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,370
<font color="yellow">Back then, you came with
Detective Kim Sang Shik.</font>

65
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,310
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,870
<font color="yellow">I see I'm right.</font>

67
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,370
<font color="yellow">My career has been about finding
people with just one picture.</font>

68
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,130
<font color="yellow">I'm a natural at remembering faces.</font>

69
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,540
<font color="yellow">I was checking to see if
Kim Sang Shik came alone.</font>

70
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,740
<font color="yellow">I thought it was suspicious that you
were parked outside waiting.</font>

71
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,790
<font color="yellow">If the detective hadn't stepped in,
you would be...</font>

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,520
<font color="yellow">You're talking nonsense.</font>

73
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,770
<font color="yellow">This is very interesting.</font>

74
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,670
<font color="yellow">The man who kidnapped Jung Hye In's son
also brought up Detective Kim Sang Shik.</font>

75
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
<font color="yellow">Did you kidnap Jung Hye In's son?</font>

76
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,810
<font color="yellow">If I told people about this...</font>

77
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,780
<font color="yellow">what would happen?</font>

78
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,090
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone.</font>

79
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,390
<font color="yellow">I can't have you report this.</font>

80
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,330
<font color="yellow">Stand right here so that
I can see your feet.</font>

81
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Jo Nam Chul is here at Set I
waiting room at UCN.</i></font>

82
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,880
<font color="yellow"><i>My connection to Detective Kim Sang Shik
has been found out.</i></font>

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,370
<font color="yellow"><i>I think we need to get him out of here.</i></font>

84
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,170
<font color="yellow"><i>We can't take him out of there.</i></font>

85
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,550
<font color="yellow"><i>We have to get rid of him.</i></font>

86
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,470
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

87
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,510
<font color="yellow"><i>The assistant director knows my face.</i></font>

88
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,240
<font color="yellow"><i>It will be easy to get the police
to come after me.</i></font>

89
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,190
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

90
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,070
<font color="yellow">You have to go on air soon.</font>

91
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,620
<font color="yellow">We want to film some interview footage.</font>

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,540
<font color="yellow">I need to put the mic on you.</font>

93
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,180
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

94
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,160
<font color="yellow">What is this? Who are you?</font>

95
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,310
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

96
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,760
<font color="yellow">I'm the younger brother of Na Jae Hyun,
the person that you killed.</font>

97
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,240
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyun!</font>

98
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,530
<font color="yellow">He deserved to die.</font>

99
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,050
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

100
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,790
<font color="yellow">You can't get caught yet, Mister.</font>

101
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,650
<font color="yellow">I'll be seen on the CCTV and
the assistant director will recognize me.</font>

102
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,490
<font color="yellow">I want you to confirm that it was me.</font>

103
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,020
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have dragged you into this.</font>

104
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,790
<font color="yellow">Mister...</font>

105
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,770
<font color="yellow">That plan you talked about?</font>

106
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,820
<font color="yellow">I want to see it through.</font>

107
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,420
<font color="yellow">Even if I don't get to see it,
I want other people to see it.</font>

108
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,310
<font color="yellow">I was planning on turning myself in
and paying for my crimes anyhow.</font>

109
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,840
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

110
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,790
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

111
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,620
<font color="yellow">I got revenge for my brother.</font>

112
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,710
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself.</font>

113
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,850
<font color="yellow">Keep in touch and get out of here.</font>

114
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mister.</font>

115
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,090
<font color="yellow">I have to do this so
people don't suspect you.</font>

116
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,490
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have dragged you into this.</font>

117
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,920
<font color="yellow">I made you get blood on your hands.</font>

118
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,730
<font color="yellow">Now, you've died at their hands.</font>

119
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,430
<font color="yellow">What's going on right now?</font>

120
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,130
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

121
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,640
<font color="yellow">Tell me right now.</font>

122
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,960
<font color="yellow">Why did Jung Hye In run out and
where is the Executive Director?</font>

123
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,890
<font color="yellow">What was the phone call from
the Executive Director about?</font>

124
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,880
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu...</font>

125
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,920
<font color="yellow">is the culprit.</font>

126
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,520
<font color="yellow">Why would he?</font>

127
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,090
<font color="yellow">Why would he do such a thing?</font>

128
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,960
<font color="yellow">Was it because of his bad relationship
with President Song?</font>

129
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,530
<font color="yellow">His wife died suddenly eight years ago.</font>

130
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,970
<font color="yellow">She was pregnant and
they couldn't save the baby.</font>

131
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,310
<font color="yellow">I think it's connected to
how Na Young Hyun died.</font>

132
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,060
<font color="yellow">We still have two episodes left.</font>

133
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,320
<font color="yellow">The accomplices are dying,
going missing, or being revealed.</font>

134
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,190
<font color="yellow">Isn't this more dangerous for Hyun Woo?</font>

135
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,260
<font color="yellow">He won't hurt Hyun Woo.</font>

136
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,450
<font color="yellow">He's not in a normal state of mind.</font>

137
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,590
<font color="yellow">We should put out a public notice
and get information.</font>

138
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,760
<font color="yellow">That could provoke him even more.</font>

139
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,130
<font color="yellow">We have just heard from the kidnapper.</font>

140
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,120
<font color="yellow">He has asked us to reveal
one thing on this show today.</font>

141
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,770
<font color="yellow">His accomplice Na Soo Hyun
was stabbed to death today.</font>

142
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,230
<font color="yellow"><i>It is presumed that SG Group
ordered for him to be killed.</i></font>

143
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, did you look into it?</font>

144
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,390
<font color="yellow">Choi Joon Gu has disappeared.</font>

145
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,610
<font color="yellow">The police are looking for him.</font>

146
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,640
<font color="yellow">Look into Choi Joon Gu
and any place he might go to.</font>

147
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,270
<font color="yellow">Report back often.</font>

148
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,190
<font color="yellow">Earlier in the show</font>

149
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,590
<font color="yellow">we told you that we figured out
what the kidnapper wanted us to know.</font>

150
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,200
<font color="yellow"><i>This case started with the death of
Na Jae Hyun and Na Soo Hyun's sister.</i></font>

151
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,210
<font color="yellow">In 2007, Na Young Hyun was six years old.</font>

152
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,970
<font color="yellow">She died of acute interstitial pneumonia.</font>

153
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,130
<font color="yellow">The cause for her illness
was unknown at the time.</font>

154
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,560
<font color="yellow">The first mission's target
was Kim Woo Jin.</font>

155
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
<font color="yellow">He was a professor of veterinary science
at Korea University.</font>

156
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,230
<font color="yellow">He conducted research between
the years of 2008 and 2009.</font>

157
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,460
<font color="yellow">That research contributed to
the death of Na Young Hyun.</font>

158
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,320
<font color="yellow">The second mission's target
was Ha Dong Min.</font>

159
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,230
<font color="yellow">He was Na Young Hyun's physician in 2007.</font>

160
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:45,170
<font color="yellow">He knew the cause of her illness,
but distorted the truth.</font>

161
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,480
<font color="yellow">Both of these men received support
from SG Group after the fact.</font>

162
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,430
<font color="yellow">They continued to
thrive in their careers.</font>

163
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,250
<font color="yellow"><i>[HAM TAE YOUNG:
SG CHEMICAL VICE PRESIDENT]</i></font>

164
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,670
<font color="yellow">Now, we have one crucial question left.</font>

165
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,460
<font color="yellow">Why did Na Jae Hyun
and Ham Tae Young meet?</font>

166
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,380
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun found evidence of
what caused his sister's death.</font>

167
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,580
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young was Vice President of
SG Group's affiliate SG Chemical.</font>

168
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,870
<font color="yellow"><i>We believe it is connected to
a product made by SG Chemical.</i></font>

169
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,170
<font color="yellow"><i>That is our theory.</i></font>

170
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,930
<font color="yellow">Find Hyun Woo now.</font>

171
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,090
<font color="yellow">Bring Lee Ji Eun to me, as well.</font>

172
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,810
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young wanted SG Chemical
to take responsibility.</font>

173
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,750
<font color="yellow">He wanted to set things right.</font>

174
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,590
<font color="yellow">SG Group wanted to conceal the truth.</font>

175
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,150
<font color="yellow">So, it seems these two men were murdered.</font>

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,650
<font color="yellow">Today, we will end the show here.</font>

177
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,150
<font color="yellow">We will end it by showing the connections
between all the people in the missions.</font>

178
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,590
<font color="yellow">I would like to make a request to
the person who has Hyun Woo.</font>

179
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,170
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo...</font>

180
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,590
<font color="yellow">please just return him to me.</font>

181
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't have Hyun Woo...</font>

182
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,670
<font color="yellow">we will keep digging and find the truth.</font>

183
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,270
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll keep going to the end.</i></font>

184
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,660
<font color="yellow"><i>So, please...</i></font>

185
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Please give me Hyun Woo.</i></font>

186
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Give Hyun Woo back to me.</i></font>

187
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,350
<font color="yellow">Mother-in-law.</font>

188
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,050
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

189
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,860
<font color="yellow">You said you'd never come here.</font>

190
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

191
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,720
<font color="yellow">It didn't work out the way I thought.</font>

192
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have to go
to my last resort.</font>

193
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,760
<font color="yellow">Last resort? What is that?</font>

194
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,120
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking right now?</font>

195
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,240
<font color="yellow">What about Hyun Woo?</font>

196
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,310
<font color="yellow">You can stop now.</font>

197
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,130
<font color="yellow">You've done enough.</font>

198
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,420
<font color="yellow">You wanted people to know
what happened to my daughter.</font>

199
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,270
<font color="yellow">But, to do that to that young child...</font>

200
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,050
<font color="yellow">You don't know how much I've regretted
accepting you when you came to me.</font>

201
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,870
<font color="yellow">What has that young child done wrong?</font>

202
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,130
<font color="yellow">Let's return him to his mom now.</font>

203
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,450
<font color="yellow">Wrong?</font>

204
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,410
<font color="yellow">Then what did my Sun Young do wrong?</font>

205
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,540
<font color="yellow">And what about my baby who
didn't even get to open its eyes?</font>

206
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,850
<font color="yellow">What about Soo Hyun and his siblings
who all died at their hands?</font>

207
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,270
<font color="yellow">What did they do that so wrong
that they died like that?</font>

208
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,420
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

209
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,400
<font color="yellow">Where do you think
Executive Director Choi is?</font>

210
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,110
<font color="yellow">He's probably moving Hyun Woo first.</font>

211
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,190
<font color="yellow">We need to find him before he does.</font>

212
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,290
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about it
all through the show.</font>

213
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,320
<font color="yellow">This person.</font>

214
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,880
<font color="yellow"><i>Hyun Woo, I told you not to watch this.</i></font>

215
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,620
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not a good show.</i></font>

216
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,920
<font color="yellow"><i>Your mom wouldn't like it either.</i></font>

217
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,270
<font color="yellow">Executive Choi's mother is dead.</font>

218
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,870
<font color="yellow">The only older woman who
would help him like this is...</font>

219
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,000
<font color="yellow">Who else would be as sad
about his wife's death as him?</font>

220
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,210
<font color="yellow">It would be her mother.
It's Choi Joon Gu's mother-in-law.</font>

221
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,000
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

222
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,120
<font color="yellow">Everything will end tomorrow.</font>

223
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,110
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow?</font>

224
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,760
<font color="yellow">You should pack your things.</font>

225
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,410
<font color="yellow">Once SG Group finds out and comes,
this thing will end immediately.</font>

226
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,530
<font color="yellow">We will all die.</font>

227
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:32,554

228
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chief.</font>

229
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,730
<font color="yellow">We're on our way to Choi Joon Gu's
mother-in-law's home.</font>

230
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,830
<font color="yellow">It's Songhwa Apartment in Yeoui-do.
Apartment 509.</font>

231
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,030
<font color="yellow">We'll be arriving soon.</font>

232
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,910
<font color="yellow">There's a chance that Hyun Woo will
be there.</font>

233
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,510
<font color="yellow">It could become a hostage situation.
We will need back-up.</font>

234
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,800
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

235
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,810
<font color="yellow">Bringing Hyun Woo back safely
is the top priority.</font>

236
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,890
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

237
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,330
<font color="yellow">Things just keep going wrong.</font>

238
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,040
<font color="yellow">We know who the kidnapper is.
We will catch him.</font>

239
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,720
<font color="yellow">Regarding Na Soo Hyun,
I'll make sure to take care...</font>

240
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,150
<font color="yellow">Right about now...</font>

241
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,060
<font color="yellow">I think it's a good time to make an
appearance at the police department.</font>

242
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,340
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

243
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,820
<font color="yellow">A detective kidnapped a criminal
and hid her away.</font>

244
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,010
<font color="yellow">He doesn't follow orders.</font>

245
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,560
<font color="yellow">He goes here and there
doing illegal investigations.</font>

246
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know how that's even possible.</font>

247
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,980
<font color="yellow">I will deal with
Lieutenant Cha Seung In...</font>

248
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,390
<font color="yellow">Take care of it immediately.</font>

249
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,970
<font color="yellow">Hands and feet that you
can't control should be cut off.</font>

250
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,330
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

251
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,210
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come outside!</font>

252
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,600
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi doesn't seem
like a person who'd hurt a child.</font>

253
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,740
<font color="yellow">He already kidnapped Hyun Woo
just to get what he wants.</font>

254
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,970
<font color="yellow">Stand guard here.</font>

255
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,010
<font color="yellow">Hye In, this way.</font>

256
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,940
<font color="yellow">He didn't come down. I'm coming up now.</font>

257
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,010
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

258
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,410
<font color="yellow">We're too late.</font>

259
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,210
<font color="yellow">Chief, he's already left.</font>

260
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,130
<font color="yellow">Our back-up has arrived.
I'll tell them to search the area.</font>

261
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,060
<font color="yellow">They can't have gone too far. Okay.</font>

262
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,850
<font color="yellow">I'll go out and let them know.</font>

263
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,870
<font color="yellow">Is Lieutenant Cha Seung In here?</font>

264
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,240
<font color="yellow">He's out at a crime scene.</font>

265
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,120
<font color="yellow">Where is that, exactly?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[INTERNAL AFFAIRS]</i></font>

267
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,070
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,120
<font color="yellow">He's going to have come back now.</font>

269
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,330

271
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,350
<font color="yellow">Internal Affairs is looking for you.
Did you cause trouble again or what?</font>

273
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,790
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

<font color="yellow">All right, I'll head in now.</font>

275
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,780
<font color="yellow">Internal Affairs is looking for me.</font>

276
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,070
<font color="yellow">It's only logical that they
would come looking for me.</font>

277
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,390
<font color="yellow">It could be an order from SG.</font>

278
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,250

280
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,150

missing person's case...</font>

281
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,040

these tapes to find Hyun Woo.</font>

to my broadcast team?</font>

283
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,930

with a crazy show like this.</font>

285
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,680
<font color="yellow">Why does that have to be you?</font>

286
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,510
<font color="yellow">When everything falls apart...</font>

287
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,470
<font color="yellow">you'll need someone
to take responsibility.</font>

288
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,950
<font color="yellow">I'm a little worried about
Executive Director Choi.</font>

289
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,420
<font color="yellow">If he's going be like an ethics
teacher in every situation</font>

290
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,920
<font color="yellow">won't that take too
much energy out of us?</font>

291
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,330
<font color="yellow">I need that.</font>

292
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,290
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to think about whether
something is right or wrong.</font>

293
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,050
<font color="yellow">It would be nice to have
someone think about it for me.</font>

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,260
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon, you're my accelerator,
and Joon Gu is my brake.</font>

295

is going to be released soon.</font>

296
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,050
<font color="yellow">A criminal is getting released.</font>

297
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,820
<font color="yellow">A detective that worked hard to catch
him is getting called in?</font>

<font color="yellow">How great is SG that this is happening?</font>

299
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,050
<font color="yellow">I will do what it takes to find a way.</font>

300
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,800
<font color="yellow">Get going. See you later.</font>

301
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,990
<font color="yellow">I'll bring Hye In so
see you during the meeting.</font>

302
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,740
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that we were able to help
them thanks to the show.</font>

303
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,290
<font color="yellow">Let's not get too excited.</font>

304
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,090
<font color="yellow">We are doing the show because
the kidnapper is demanding it.</font>

305
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,910
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that we're forced into this
because we need to find Hyun Woo.</font>

306
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,200
<font color="yellow">Ah... okay.</font>

307
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,260
<font color="yellow">You should eat.</font>

308
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,140
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Do you know what though?</font>

309
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,750
<font color="yellow">You need to eat well
in order to last long.</font>

310
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sure everything was
new and hard for you today.</font>

311
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
<font color="yellow">You did a good job.</font>

312
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Executive Director.</font>

<font color="yellow">She's alive... she's alive!</font>

315
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
<font color="yellow">Director Shin, where are you?</font>

316
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,230
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

317
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,050
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

318
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,120
<font color="yellow">Can you take me to SG Life?</font>

319
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,180
<font color="yellow">I think it'd be better if you didn't go,
especially alone.</font>

320
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,700
<font color="yellow">No, I have to go.</font>

321
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,900
<font color="yellow">I need to know what SG is planning
to do after seeing today's show.</font>

322
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,840
<font color="yellow">If they were planning to hurt me,
they would have done it quietly already.</font>

323
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,310
<font color="yellow">Just like they did to my husband.</font>

324
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,260
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

325
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,040
<font color="yellow">I think... there must have been a
misunderstanding between us.</font>

326
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,150
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

327
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,640
<font color="yellow">With the matter of Choi Pil Kyu,
let's chalk that up to excessive loyalty.</font>

328
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,730
<font color="yellow">However, what you said about
Tae Young and SG Chemical...</font>

329
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,190
<font color="yellow">and the way you did it.</font>

330
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,750
<font color="yellow">I was a bit shocked by it.</font>

331
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,880
<font color="yellow">You did everything the
kidnapper asked you to do.</font>

332
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,780
<font color="yellow">You spoke of these theories
as if they were facts.</font>

333
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,480
<font color="yellow">Whether they are facts or not will be
revealed once we look into it deeper.</font>

334
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,660
<font color="yellow">Will you continue with the show?</font>

335
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,880
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

336
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,200
<font color="yellow">I heard that Executive Director Choi
suddenly disappeared.</font>

337
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,990
<font color="yellow">And the police are looking for him.</font>

338
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,420
<font color="yellow">Isn't he the kidnapper?</font>

339
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,930
<font color="yellow">We haven't found Hyun Woo so we
will have to continue with the show.</font>

340
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,200
<font color="yellow">More so because the kidnapper
is acting very recklessly.</font>

341
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,980
<font color="yellow">That is a relief to hear.</font>

342
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,860
<font color="yellow">I was worried you might stop once you
found out who the kidnapper was.</font>

343
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,100
<font color="yellow">It didn't turn out to be
what I imagined it to be.</font>

344
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,620
<font color="yellow">Anyway...</font>

345
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,260
<font color="yellow">What are you referring to?</font>

346
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,380
<font color="yellow">We are looking for Hyun Woo right now.</font>

347
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
<font color="yellow">We are using all our resources.</font>

348
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,780
<font color="yellow">We know who the kidnapper is now.</font>

349
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,270
<font color="yellow">I think we might find
him before the police.</font>

350
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,370
<font color="yellow">We have put in a strong request
to the police this time.</font>

351
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,110
<font color="yellow">The show will be a cooperation between
SG Group and you, Jung Hye In.</font>

352
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,630
<font color="yellow">I would like for it to end
happily with us finding Hyun Woo.</font>

353
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,860
<font color="yellow">That way, I will have justification
for acquiring UCN.</font>

354
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,570
<font color="yellow">I will be thankful as long
as you can find Hyun Woo.</font>

355
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,670
<font color="yellow">I did make you that promise.</font>

356
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,630
<font color="yellow">I'm glad we're of the same opinion.</font>

357
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:45,300
<font color="yellow">I trust you will correct the story from
today's show by the next episode.</font>

358
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,520
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

359
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,520
<font color="yellow">Wait... I think I forgot one thing.</font>

360
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,270
<font color="yellow">Whether the police find him or we do...</font>

361
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,520
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo will come to us first.</font>

362
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,740
<font color="yellow">I thought you should know.</font>

363
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,600
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha.</font>

364
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,390
<font color="yellow">From the start, were you in on planning
a UCN blackout and taking Lee Ji Eun?</font>

365
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,080
<font color="yellow">Or did you later hear about it and
just not report it?</font>

366
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,180
<font color="yellow">Think carefully.</font>

367
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,490
<font color="yellow">Did you take part in it
or did you not report it?</font>

368
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,620
<font color="yellow">You know the weight of those crimes
are completely different, right?</font>

369
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,150
<font color="yellow">"Ah, how did they find out?"</font>

370
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,670
<font color="yellow">You know that man you caught
at Ko Hyung Joon's office.</font>

371
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,890
<font color="yellow">He says he witnessed you near
Na Soo Hyun as he was dying.</font>

372
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,680
<font color="yellow">That's a bit strange.</font>

373
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,260
<font color="yellow">Why were you there?</font>

374
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,870
<font color="yellow">He even saw Lee Ji Eun and Jung Hye In
run away in your car.</font>

375
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,930
<font color="yellow">You apparently told them to do it.</font>

376
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,870
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you responding when
people are speaking to you?</font>

377
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,970
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha Seung In.</font>

378
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,050
<font color="yellow">It only becomes harder if
you drag things out like this.</font>

379
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,970
<font color="yellow">We're just here to help.</font>

380
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,060
<font color="yellow">Do you have a warrant?</font>

381
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,240
<font color="yellow">Should I bring one?</font>

382
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,870
<font color="yellow">It will end well after
a few days of investigation.</font>

383
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,920
<font color="yellow">There's no need to be so prickly.</font>

384
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,340
<font color="yellow">Unless you plan to quit being a cop,
just cooperate with us.</font>

385
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,790
<font color="yellow">This is from Senior Joon Gu's
mother-in-law's house.</font>

386
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,800
<font color="yellow">He's been preparing for this
for a long time.</font>

387
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,880
<font color="yellow">He wanted to make his own show.</font>

388
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,270
<font color="yellow">It probably got stopped due
to external pressure.</font>

389
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,810
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu left the station in 2009.</font>

390
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,000
<font color="yellow">Everything's making sense now.</font>

391
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,050
<font color="yellow">I only looked at it briefly.</font>

392
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,570
<font color="yellow">Kim Woo Jin, Ha Dong Min, Im Hyung Soon,
Jo Nam Chul, Ko Hyung Joon...</font>

393
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,700
<font color="yellow">the police commissioner,
and Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

394
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,360
<font color="yellow">He's been watching them and keeping
track of what they've done wrong.</font>

395
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,720
<font color="yellow">He started in 2009 and went until now.</font>

396
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,310
<font color="yellow">There are files on Ko Hyung Joon's
detective agency too.</font>

397
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,590
<font color="yellow">We better look at this quickly.</font>

398
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,190
<font color="yellow">We need to know why Joon Gu
wanted to do this</font>

399
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,780
<font color="yellow">and what he planned in episode 10.</font>

400
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,890
<font color="yellow">We have to figure it out.</font>

401
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,760
<font color="yellow">It's been exposed
that he's the kidnapper.</font>

402
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,260
<font color="yellow">He might think that
this is his last chance.</font>

403
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,740
<font color="yellow">We need to figure out his plan and
get a step ahead or negotiate with him.</font>

404
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,180
<font color="yellow">- We can use the show to...
- What if...</font>

405
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,800
<font color="yellow">What if we find out what he wants
and can't do it for him?</font>

406
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,920
<font color="yellow">No, what if it's something
we should not do for him.</font>

407
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,400
<font color="yellow">We still have to do it.</font>

408
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,090
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is in more danger now.</font>

409
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,030
<font color="yellow">SG is looking for Hyun Woo too.</font>

410
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,180
<font color="yellow"><i>[CHOI JOON GU?]

411
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,760
<font color="yellow">Wow! It's amazing.</font>

412
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,750
<font color="yellow">I think the kidnapper is
on the broadcast team.</font>

413
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,800
<font color="yellow">When Jung Hye In ran off the set,
she figured it out, right?</font>

414
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,620
<font color="yellow">The team is gathered up somewhere,
so it seems like they all know too.</font>

415
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,080
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

416
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,750
<font color="yellow">I think the police know too.</font>

417
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,310
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha Seung In came running in.</font>

418
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,160
<font color="yellow">He asked where that person was.</font>

419
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,370
<font color="yellow">Should I take a guess who that is?</font>

420
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,590
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi Joon Gu.</font>

421
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,100
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

422
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,210
<font color="yellow">I've done some investigating of my own.</font>

423
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,020
<font color="yellow">Oh! It's so hot, isn't it?</font>

424
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,820
<font color="yellow">I told you. I have nothing to say.</font>

425
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,160
<font color="yellow">I'm only here because you begged me.</font>

426
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,720
<font color="yellow">I barely managed to get permission to
write the article too, so please help me.</font>

427
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,590
<font color="yellow">Just tell me what your son-in-law
was like from your point of view.</font>

428
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,390
<font color="yellow">That's all I wanted to ask.</font>

429
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,520
<font color="yellow">You're the only family he has left.</font>

430
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,470
<font color="yellow">What do you mean family?</font>

431
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,410
<font color="yellow">We're strangers now
after all these years.</font>

432
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,440
<font color="yellow">He should forget
everything and live well.</font>

433
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,930
<font color="yellow">It's been so long
since my daughter passed.</font>

434
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,980
<font color="yellow">Then tell me how he was before
your daughter passed away.</font>

435
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,690
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I'm not feeling very good.</font>

436
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,790
<font color="yellow">Please leave. I have nothing to say.</font>

437
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,840
<font color="yellow">Don't look for me again.</font>

438
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,270
<font color="yellow">Wait, Ma'am!</font>

439
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,750
<font color="yellow">You recorded an audio file today, right?
Email it to me.</font>

440
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,000
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

441
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,270
<font color="yellow">You know what you promised me?
When do I get it?</font>

442
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,130
<font color="yellow">I want to listen to it first.
We'll talk if there's anything useful.</font>

443

<font color="yellow">First, tell me something to go on.</font>

459
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,720
<font color="yellow">I need a taste of it before I decide
to gamble my life on this or not.</font>

460
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,810
<font color="yellow">I must have called the wrong person.</font>

<font color="yellow">If you don't want to,
there's nothing I can do.</font>

462
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,970
<font color="yellow">- I'm hanging up.
- Wait, wait!</font>

463
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,990
<font color="yellow">You didn't hang up, right?</font>

you destroyed my phone.</font>

and try to convince them.</font>

him there until the show ends.</font>

00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,330

Who knows what happens if they move him.</font>

472
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,480

report to SG not the police.</font>

00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,140

and she's supposed to be on break now.</font>

only go after Seung In?</font>

00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,430
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be back soon. Oh yeah!</font>

591
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,540
<font color="yellow">Baby, your dad will be back soon.</font>

592
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,930
<font color="yellow">Be good with your mom.</font>

593
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,140
<font color="yellow">Baby says to get going.
I'll be back!</font>

594
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,010
<font color="yellow">What is it? Should I buy something
for you when I come home?</font>

595
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,710
<font color="yellow">Hello? Why aren't you talking?</font>

596
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,900
<font color="yellow">Honey?</font>

597
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,080
<font color="yellow">What... what is it? Is something wrong?</font>

598
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,220
<font color="yellow"><i>Can't breathe... I can't breathe!</i></font>

599
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,830
<font color="yellow">Honey! Sun Young!</font>

600
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,040
<font color="yellow">Sun Young, what is it?</font>

601
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,230
<font color="yellow"><i>And in just one week...</i></font>

602
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,990
<font color="yellow"><i>he said he lost both his wife and baby.</i></font>

603
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,780
<font color="yellow"><i>He didn't know it, at the time.</i></font>

604
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,410
<font color="yellow"><i>He couldn't have imagined it
was the air purifier humidifier.</i></font>

605
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,380
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to tell you all the
details about my daughter and I.</font>

606
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it will help you.</font>

607
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,060
<font color="yellow">It was very helpful.</font>

608
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,600
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming out
of your way to talk to us.</font>

609
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,670
<font color="yellow">Please contact me if you
ever have any questions to ask.</font>

610
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:49,310
<font color="yellow">There are more people
like me that I know.</font>

611
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,760
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

612
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,490
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

613
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,390
<font color="yellow">If I...</font>

614
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,030
<font color="yellow">If, at least, I had helped
that director back then...</font>

615
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,510
<font color="yellow">And people had found out
about this back then...</font>

616
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,860
<font color="yellow">maybe Hyun Woo wouldn't
have been kidnapped.</font>

617
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,100
<font color="yellow">People might not have died.</font>

618
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,140
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that?</font>

619
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,960
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

620
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,740
<font color="yellow">Don't speak that way.</font>

621
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,350
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

622
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,500
<font color="yellow">I really hope you find him.</font>

623
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,580
<font color="yellow">Eat some.</font>

624
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,320
<font color="yellow">You'll be tired if you
get questioned all day today.</font>

625
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,730
<font color="yellow">What more do you have left to ask?</font>

626
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,680
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you know better?</font>

627
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,270
<font color="yellow">I will be disciplined for what
you've already questioned me about.</font>

628
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,560
<font color="yellow">Or I'll been cleared of all fault.</font>

629
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,260
<font color="yellow">The situation has changed.</font>

630
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:17,140
<font color="yellow">Your location and movements have been
startling ever since Wanted started.</font>

631
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:22,240
<font color="yellow">Right now, you're even being investigated
for kidnapping Song Hyun Woo.</font>

632
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,130
<font color="yellow">So, why don't we retrace
your past seven years?</font>

633
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,210
<font color="yellow">Let's stop here for now.</font>

634
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:47,080
<font color="yellow">As long as you don't resign,
we'll probably see you soon.</font>

635
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,890
<font color="yellow">Get to the hospital quickly.</font>

636
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,630
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

637
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,960
<font color="yellow">That kid met the wrong senior.</font>

638
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,840
<font color="yellow">He learned his job the wrong way.</font>

639
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:58,800
<font color="yellow">He tried to catch a group of four
burglars by himself and got hurt.</font>

640
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,320
<font color="yellow">Where is Lee Young Gwan?</font>

641
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,870
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

642
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,240
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

643
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,450
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

644
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,920
<font color="yellow">Who did this?</font>

645
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,000
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun...</font>

646
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,870
<font color="yellow">Have to save her.</font>

647
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,520
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun.</font>

648
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,780
<font color="yellow">They took her.</font>

649
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,760
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

650
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,280
<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

651
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,370
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

652
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,260
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

653
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,400
