1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,630
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,110
<font color="yellow">I'm with Lieutenant Oh Mi Ock.</font>

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,000
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyun... is dead.</font>

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,170
<font color="yellow">SG sent people to kill him.</font>

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
<font color="yellow">I think Senior Joon Gu is the kidnapper.</font>

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,400
<font color="yellow">His wife died eight years ago.</font>

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,470
<font color="yellow">She was seven months pregnant
and no one knew the cause.</font>

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,020
<font color="yellow">If this has something do with what
happened seven years ago</font>

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,120
<font color="yellow">it all makes perfect sense.</font>

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,350
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun was able to get
a call out to the kidnapper.</font>

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,230
<font color="yellow">Right after that, Executive Director Choi
disappeared.</font>

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,850
<font color="yellow">Hello? Joon Gu?</font>

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,610
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu just called me.</font>

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,670
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,210
<font color="yellow">He said to finish the rest of the show.</font>

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,000
<font color="yellow">He wants you to reveal that SG Group
ordered people to kill Na Soo Hyun.</font>

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,670
<font color="yellow">We have just heard from the kidnapper.</font>

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,080
<font color="yellow">He has asked us to reveal
one thing on this show today.</font>

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,340
<font color="yellow">His accomplice Na Soo Hyun
was stabbed to death today.</font>

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,780
<font color="yellow">It is presumed that SG Group
ordered him to be killed.</font>

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,190
<font color="yellow">Where do you think
Executive Director Choi went?</font>

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,040
<font color="yellow">Executive Choi's mother is dead.</font>

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,430
<font color="yellow">The only older woman who
would help him like this is...</font>

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,600
<font color="yellow">Everything will end tomorrow.</font>

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,730
<font color="yellow">You should pack your things.</font>

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,880
<font color="yellow">Once SG Group finds out and comes,
this thing will end immediately.</font>

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,510
<font color="yellow">This is from Senior Joon Gu's
mother-in-law's house.</font>

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,640
<font color="yellow">He's been preparing for this
for a long time.</font>

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,780
<font color="yellow">Kim Woo Jin, Ha Dong Min, Im Hyung Soon,
Jo Nam Chul, Ko Hyung Joon...</font>

30
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,830
<font color="yellow">the police commissioner,
and Choi Pil Kyu.</font>

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,070
<font color="yellow">He's been watching them</font>

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,320
<font color="yellow">and keeping track of
what they've done wrong.</font>

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,260
<font color="yellow">He's had them investigated by a
private detective agency since 2009.</font>

34
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,740
<font color="yellow">We need to know why Joon Gu
wanted to do this show.</font>

35
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,960
<font color="yellow">And what he planned to do in episode 10.</font>

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,260
<font color="yellow">This is the office for Wanted, right?</font>

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,030
<font color="yellow">Honey! Sun Young!</font>

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,610
<font color="yellow">And in just one week...</font>

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,700
<font color="yellow">he said he lost both his wife and baby.</font>

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,870
<font color="yellow">He didn't know it, at the time.</font>

41
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,220
<font color="yellow">He couldn't have imagined it was
the air purifier humidifier.</font>

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,470
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

43
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,330
<font color="yellow">Hye In, it's me.</font>

44
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,450
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,570
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo, you son of a bitch!</font>

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,870
<font color="yellow"><i>[EPISODE 14]</i></font>

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,610
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd come
home until the show ended.</font>

48
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,310
<font color="yellow">Don't turn on the lights.</font>

49
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,730
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to hide?</font>

50
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

51
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,710
<font color="yellow">How did you know the entry code?</font>

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,160
<font color="yellow">You're pretty simple with these things.</font>

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,590
<font color="yellow">I tried your birthday and it worked.</font>

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,210
<font color="yellow">What about Hyun Woo?</font>

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,960
<font color="yellow">He's okay.</font>

56
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,580
<font color="yellow">Can you really say he's okay
just because he's physically safe?</font>

57
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,080
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,970
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me about your wife
and how the station shut you down?</font>

59
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,550
<font color="yellow">About all the people dying...</font>

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,100
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you ask to do it together
before doing something so big?</font>

61
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,570
<font color="yellow">Those people who died...</font>

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,680
<font color="yellow">was it really you who did it?</font>

63
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,980
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

64
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,300
<font color="yellow">What if I report you? Why are you here?</font>

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,100
<font color="yellow">I thought you would want
to see how this show concludes.</font>

66
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,730
<font color="yellow">That's why I pulled you into it.</font>

67
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,200
<font color="yellow">I don't know you at all.</font>

68
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,910
<font color="yellow">You talk about me like
you know me so well.</font>

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,500
<font color="yellow">- I came here because...
- What are you planning to do?</font>

70
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,090
<font color="yellow">- I have to finish things.
- Turn yourself in.</font>

71
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,080
<font color="yellow">Turn yourself in, hand Hyun Woo over,
and as for the show...</font>

72
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,960
<font color="yellow">I will do what it is that you wanted.</font>

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,460
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I learned
over and over these last eight years?</font>

74
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,470
<font color="yellow">I was so naive.</font>

75
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,150
<font color="yellow">Even I had made the show back then...</font>

76
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,310
<font color="yellow">nothing would have changed.</font>

77
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,510
<font color="yellow">Then what do we do to change things?
What is it that you want to do?</font>

78
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,120
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

79
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,000
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,640
<font color="yellow">You'll know once you see it.</font>

81
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,210
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

82
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,520
<font color="yellow">If you end up finishing
the show on your own</font>

83
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,300
<font color="yellow">please make sure to use it.</font>

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,290
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Oh! Where are you?</font>

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,890
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I haven't called.</font>

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,820
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun has been taken by SG.</font>

87
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,450
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha was with internal affairs
and four of them came.</font>

88
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,010
<font color="yellow">Detective Lee tried to stop them
and he ended up getting injured.</font>

89
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,910
<font color="yellow">Both the internal affair and
this attack on Young Gwan...</font>

90
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,260
<font color="yellow">they're going after Lieutenant Cha.</font>

91
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,330
<font color="yellow">I got a call from Choi Joon Gu.</font>

92
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,450
<font color="yellow">Where is Lee Ji Eun?</font>

93
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,170
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

94
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

95
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,870
<font color="yellow">You need to tell me
where Hyun Woo is first.</font>

96
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,460
<font color="yellow">SG is looking for you right now.</font>

97
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,540
<font color="yellow">If they find you before we do,
Hyun Woo will be...</font>

98
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,980
<font color="yellow">Saying that to me won't change anything.</font>

99
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,070
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have started this
to begin with if that mattered.</font>

100
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,870
<font color="yellow">If you want to get Hyun Woo back</font>

101
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,960
<font color="yellow">proceed with the show like
you have been up until now.</font>

102
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
<font color="yellow">Also, about Lee Ji Eun...</font>

103
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,800
<font color="yellow">Bring her to Ohseok Terminal at midnight.</font>

104
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,570
<font color="yellow">That way...</font>

105
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,260
<font color="yellow">you will get proof
that Hyun Woo is alive.</font>

106
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't keep
Lee Ji Eun safe.</font>

107
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,650
<font color="yellow">I'll be here until Detective Lee's
family arrives.</font>

108
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,330
<font color="yellow">I can't trust any other police.</font>

109
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,430
<font color="yellow">I don't know who's
connected to SG and who isn't.</font>

110
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,480
<font color="yellow">Chief, I have a favor to ask.</font>

111
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,520
<font color="yellow">Young Gwan and Senior Mi Ock were
hurt and are at the hospital.</font>

112
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,980
<font color="yellow">Please have police stand patrol
at the hospital.</font>

113
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,500
<font color="yellow">Two or three at a time, to be safe.</font>

114
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,150
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to you later.</font>

115
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,350
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,150
<font color="yellow">I told you I don't know.</font>

117
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,260
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't know right now,
you must know where he'll end up.</font>

118
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not a person with a lot of time.</font>

119
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,320
<font color="yellow">It would be best for you
to talk while I'm still here.</font>

120
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,130
<font color="yellow">Once I leave this place,
who knows what these men will do.</font>

121
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,240
<font color="yellow"><i>You can't go in there.
I told you he's not in.</i></font>

122
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Who are you?</i></font>

123
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,970
<font color="yellow">I told you he's not in!</font>

124
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,050
<font color="yellow">Who are you anyway?</font>

125
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,790
<font color="yellow">Call him now.</font>

126
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,310
<font color="yellow">Tell him Cha Seung In is here
and I'll be waiting for him.</font>

127
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,010
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's with you?</font>

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
<font color="yellow">Now!</font>

129
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, President.</font>

130
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,080
<font color="yellow">There's a Cha Seung In here
and he's causing a commotion.</font>

131
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,100
<font color="yellow">He says he'll wait until you come.</font>

132
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,530
<font color="yellow">Give him something cold to drink.</font>

133
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,100
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,930
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha Seung In?</font>

135
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
<font color="yellow">I've heard a lot about you.</font>

136
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,040
<font color="yellow">I was hoping to meet you anyhow.</font>

137
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,610
<font color="yellow">Please sit.</font>

138
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,530
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun.</font>

139
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,960
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

140
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,580
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun?</font>

141
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,850
<font color="yellow">Why would you ask me about her?</font>

142
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,010
<font color="yellow">I would think you'd know better.</font>

143
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,590
<font color="yellow">I'm just checking up
on all possibilities.</font>

144
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,660
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

145
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,670
<font color="yellow">That's right, Chief.</font>

146
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,870
<font color="yellow">Anywhere in a ten minute vicinity from
SG Life that can used to confine someone.</font>

147
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,220
<font color="yellow">As soon as possible, please.</font>

148
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,320
<font color="yellow">A place where you could beat someone,
but screams wouldn't be heard outside.</font>

149
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,170
<font color="yellow">A place with good soundproofing or
set apart from other buildings.</font>

150
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking that,
out of the blue?</font>

151
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,510
<font color="yellow">Is this about Lee Ji Eun, by any chance?</font>

152
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,090
<font color="yellow">Can you do this without Young Gwan?</font>

153
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,960
<font color="yellow">I'll call for back-up if
it gets dangerous.</font>

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,640
<font color="yellow">Please just look into it quickly.</font>

155
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,530
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you all about it later.</font>

156
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,590
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's me.</font>

157
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,820
<font color="yellow">How is Jung Eun doing?</font>

158
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,720
<font color="yellow">Mom, has she been coughing lately?</font>

159
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

160
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,180
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take her to the hospital
once I'm done with this show.</font>

161
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,130
<font color="yellow">I want her to get some tests done.</font>

162
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,230
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just worried about something.</font>

163
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,870
<font color="yellow">How about you, Mom?
Are you feeling okay?</font>

164
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,920
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't turn on the humidifier
and don't use the air purifier.</font>

166
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,980
<font color="yellow">They say it's not good for you.</font>

167
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,210
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll talk to you later.</font>

168
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,680
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

169
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,170
<font color="yellow">The mission has arrived.</font>

170
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,700
<font color="yellow"><i>[NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
DO NOT STOP DOING THE SHOW.]</i></font>

171
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,310
<font color="yellow">Choi Joon Gu knows us
better than anyone else.</font>

172
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,210
<font color="yellow">He knows I won't stop
as long as he has Hyun Woo.</font>

173
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,180
<font color="yellow">I know you feel the same way, Dong Wook.</font>

174
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,950
<font color="yellow">But, he sent a mission like this anyway.</font>

175
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,420
<font color="yellow">That means he's planning to do
something big that should not be aired.</font>

176
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,960
<font color="yellow">We have no story for this episode.</font>

177
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,850
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want us to know beforehand.</font>

178
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,100
<font color="yellow">He's saying he'll control it
while the show is airing.</font>

179
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,160
<font color="yellow">Then what are we supposed to do?</font>

180
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,620
<font color="yellow">We need to try and figure out
what he's planning to do.</font>

181
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,430
<font color="yellow">That's the only way we can prepare.</font>

182
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,290
<font color="yellow">If this show had gone the way
he had originally planned</font>

183
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,800
<font color="yellow">what do you think the ninth and tenth
missions would've been?</font>

184
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,020
<font color="yellow">How is Young Gwan doing?</font>

185
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,610
<font color="yellow">He's seriously injured.</font>

186
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,560
<font color="yellow">What's Cha Seung In doing
when his kid is hurt like that?</font>

187
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,320
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Who can stop him?</font>

188
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,000
<font color="yellow">Tell him not to cause anymore trouble
and to be careful.</font>

189
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,470
<font color="yellow">And let me know if he needs help.</font>

190
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,390
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

191
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,050
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

192
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,690
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

193
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,880
<font color="yellow">Is the mission here?</font>

194
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,700
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking that Choi Joon Gu
sent an unexpected mission.</font>

195
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,340
<font color="yellow">By looking at the pattern so far</font>

196
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,740
<font color="yellow">I think Executive Director Choi has
been achieving two goals at once.</font>

197
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,450
<font color="yellow">One was to use the
victims and perpetrators</font>

198
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,490
<font color="yellow">of this air purifier humidifier</font>

199
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,850
<font color="yellow">and fitting them together
like puzzle pieces to tell this story.</font>

200
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,590
<font color="yellow">The second was to
punish the perpetrators.</font>

201
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,900
<font color="yellow">If everything has gone according to plan</font>

202
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,200
<font color="yellow">what is left for him to do?</font>

203
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,060
<font color="yellow">Right now, look back at
all the targets of the mission.</font>

204
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,350
<font color="yellow">Their connection to SG or the air
purifier humidifier has been exposed.</font>

205
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,750
<font color="yellow">Taking Joon Gu's personality and
his original plans into account</font>

206
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,120
<font color="yellow">if he had a truth he really
wanted to reveal...</font>

207
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,590
<font color="yellow">he would've saved it
for the last episode.</font>

208
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,750
<font color="yellow">The pattern has been to get
the person to admit their crimes.</font>

209
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,510
<font color="yellow">Then he would proceed to punish them.</font>

210
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,390
<font color="yellow">The person in charge seven years ago
was President Ham Tae Seob.</font>

211
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,500
<font color="yellow">He was in charge of SG Chemical
at the time.</font>

212
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,630
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

213
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,920
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob's crimes.</font>

214
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,140
<font color="yellow">They are what caused
the deaths of many people.</font>

215
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,980
<font color="yellow">He killed people just to cover it up.</font>

216
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,560
<font color="yellow">That was supposed to
be revealed in episode nine.</font>

217
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,310
<font color="yellow">He may have intended to
punish them in episode ten.</font>

218
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,410
<font color="yellow">But, his plans have gone awry.</font>

219
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,400
<font color="yellow">His identity has been revealed.</font>

220
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,840
<font color="yellow">He didn't send a mission to get
Ham Tae Seob on the show and confess.</font>

221
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,360
<font color="yellow">He sent a mission to make sure
we proceed with the show.</font>

222
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,210
<font color="yellow">Then, maybe Senior Hye In is right.</font>

223
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,550
<font color="yellow">He might kill Ham Tae Seob on air.</font>

224
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,240
<font color="yellow">There is a chance of that.</font>

225
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,510
<font color="yellow">President Song sure is busy.</font>

226
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,710
<font color="yellow">Where could he be
at such a critical time?</font>

227
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, President!</font>

228
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,260
<font color="yellow">This is Reporter Jang Jin Woong.
We've met before, right?</font>

229
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,780
<font color="yellow">I had something to tell you,
but you're not here.</font>

230
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,160
<font color="yellow">I met Executive Choi Joon Gu's
mother-in-law.</font>

231
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,010
<font color="yellow">She has Hyun Woo right now.</font>

232
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,390
<font color="yellow">She must feel guilty because she
opened up about everything</font>

233
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,780
<font color="yellow">after a few questions.</font>

234
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,190
<font color="yellow">She's coming tonight with
Hyun Woo at 7:00 p.m.</font>

235
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,300
<font color="yellow">She's supposed to meet
Choi Joon Gu at Haneul Park.</font>

236
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:04,070
<font color="yellow">I thought it would look great if
you made an appearance there.</font>

237
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,810
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you this.</font>

238
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know what the heck I'm doing.</font>

239
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,740
<font color="yellow">What is he up to?</font>

240
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,060
<font color="yellow">Go into President Song's office
when he's not there.</font>

241
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,980
<font color="yellow">Pretend you're talking
to him and just say it.</font>

242
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,830
<font color="yellow">I heard you met my mother-in-law.</font>

243
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,490
<font color="yellow">Use that and just say you heard
from my mother-in-law.</font>

244
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,730
<font color="yellow">Say that my mother-in-law will be meeting
me at 7:00 p.m. in Haneul Park.</font>

245
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,840
<font color="yellow">No one else can find out about this.</font>

246
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,310
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know why.</font>

247
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,110
<font color="yellow">Hi, Detective Park.</font>

248
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,690
<font color="yellow">What are you doing
in President Song's office?</font>

249
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,210
<font color="yellow">I went to interview him. What else?</font>

250
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,850
<font color="yellow">He wasn't around.</font>

251
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,430
<font color="yellow">You gave me files claiming that you
thought Shin Dong Wook was the culprit.</font>

252
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,760
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

253
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,930
<font color="yellow">You suspected Director Shin too.
I was just trying to help.</font>

254
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,330
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship
with Choi Joon Gu?</font>

255
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,740
<font color="yellow">Did you already know him?</font>

256
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,900
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you being like this?</font>

257
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,620
<font color="yellow">Let's talk for a bit.</font>

258
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,950
<font color="yellow">I... I don't have time.</font>

259
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,460
<font color="yellow">Should I get a warrant and do
it officially, or should we just talk?</font>

260
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Come on.</font>

261
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,140
<font color="yellow">Just make it quick.</font>

262
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,950
<font color="yellow">Kwon Kyung Hoon.</font>

264
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,440
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

265
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,140
<font color="yellow">We're going to meet that victim,
Han Ji Yeon.</font>

266
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,950
<font color="yellow">I want to do a proper interview.</font>

267
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly doing that?</font>

268
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,210
<font color="yellow">I understand why Executive Director Choi
felt like he had to do this.</font>

269
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,400
<font color="yellow">I feel like I could have been his wife.</font>

270
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,360
<font color="yellow">Na Young Hyun could have been
my daughter or little sister.</font>

271
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,730
<font color="yellow">So, what are you planning?</font>

272
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,630
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can make
the dead come back to life.</font>

273
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,010
<font color="yellow">But, I have to do something.</font>

274
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,600
<font color="yellow">I'll turn Han Ji Yeon's interview into
a preview and put it up.</font>

275
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,010
<font color="yellow">He'll see we're putting in an effort to
inform people about what happened.</font>

276
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,440
<font color="yellow">You never know, he might
have a change of heart.</font>

277
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,520
<font color="yellow">I'll go with you too.</font>

278
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,730
<font color="yellow">I am sorry to my daughter, of course.</font>

279
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,820
<font color="yellow">I was only trying to
do something good for her.</font>

280
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,790
<font color="yellow">To make things clean.</font>

281
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,670
<font color="yellow">To make her healthy.</font>

282
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,930
<font color="yellow">But, it was my fault in the end.</font>

283
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,390
<font color="yellow">I sent my daughter up to heaven.</font>

284
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,880
<font color="yellow">Then I ended up with the same illness.</font>

285
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,450
<font color="yellow">I'm suffering so much from this.</font>

286
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,170
<font color="yellow">How did that young child...</font>

287
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,340
<font color="yellow">They found a lung donor for me.</font>

288
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,130
<font color="yellow">That made me feel crazy.</font>

289
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,860
<font color="yellow">"Ah, I'm going to live. What a relief."</font>

290
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,610
<font color="yellow">I thought that to myself.</font>

291
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,810
<font color="yellow">I wondered to myself, am I even human?</font>

292
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,510
<font color="yellow">What kind of mother am I?</font>

293
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,090
<font color="yellow">I kept having those thoughts.</font>

294
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,130
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I learned
over and over these last eight years?</font>

295
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,230
<font color="yellow">I was so naive.</font>

296
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,940
<font color="yellow">Even if I had made the show back then...</font>

297
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,100
<font color="yellow">nothing would have changed.</font>

298
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,330
<font color="yellow">Then what do we do to change things?
What is it that you want to do?</font>

299
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,200
<font color="yellow">Hey. Wake her up.</font>

300
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,340
<font color="yellow">Put your hands up and get on the ground!</font>

301
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,200
<font color="yellow">Don't move, you punk!</font>

302
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,630
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

303
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,440
<font color="yellow">This might be uncomfortable for
you to talk about, Hye In.</font>

304
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,470
<font color="yellow">If you look at everyone that's been
involved with the show so far</font>

305
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,970
<font color="yellow">they are either victims or perpetrators
of what happened seven years ago.</font>

306
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,890
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

307
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,810
<font color="yellow">But, you're not directly tied to it.</font>

308
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,030
<font color="yellow">You're connected because of
your late husband's death.</font>

309
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,260
<font color="yellow">If you look at it that way,
you could be considered a victim.</font>

310
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,650
<font color="yellow">But seeing as Hyun Woo was kidnapped,
that could be seen as a punishment.</font>

311
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,240
<font color="yellow">I don't know what my crime is.</font>

312
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,890
<font color="yellow">So, stop dragging other people into it
and expose my crime in the next mission.</font>

313
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,880
<font color="yellow">Do it however you want to.</font>

314
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,830
<font color="yellow">So that we can reach the conclusion
that you want even faster.</font>

315
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,580
<font color="yellow">"You requested that
we expose your crime."</font>

316
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,530
<font color="yellow">"We will grant that request
for the fourth mission."</font>

317
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,910
<font color="yellow">"Your former husband did
not die in a car accident."</font>

318
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,150
<font color="yellow">"Find out how he died."</font>

319
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,210
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

320
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,620
<font color="yellow">It was supposed to be
a mission to expose my crime.</font>

321
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,700
<font color="yellow">But, he gave me a mission
regarding Tae Young.</font>

322
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,950
<font color="yellow">He didn't say I had no crime.</font>

323
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,780
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you're
hiding about that incident?</font>

324
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,060
<font color="yellow">There's nothing.</font>

325
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,180
<font color="yellow">I'm not even scared of exposing
anything I've done wrong.</font>

326
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,630
<font color="yellow">I don't care about anything
as long as I can find Hyun Woo.</font>

327
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,620
<font color="yellow">Then we need to know why
Executive Director Choi targeted you?</font>

328
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,390
<font color="yellow">We need to know what he might
consider a crime in his eyes.</font>

329
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,770
<font color="yellow">Think about it carefully.</font>

330
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,030
<font color="yellow">If there happens to be an incident
on tonight's show</font>

331
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,560
<font color="yellow">it could end up being the key in changing
Executive Director Choi's mind.</font>

332
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,490
<font color="yellow">There hasn't been anyone who has
admitted fault on their own so far.</font>

333
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,140
<font color="yellow">It has been quite hectic lately.</font>

334
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,850
<font color="yellow">I was prepared to be stood up.</font>

335
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,360
<font color="yellow">If I can't stand firm
at a time like this</font>

336
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,870
<font color="yellow">what would happen to my company?</font>

337
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
<font color="yellow">I suppose you're correct.</font>

338
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,220
<font color="yellow">No matter how much noise
the ignorant people make</font>

339
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,110
<font color="yellow">the king must stand firm
so the world can keep turning.</font>

340
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,810
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

341
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,830
<font color="yellow">I'm only doing my job.</font>

342
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,670
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure.</font>

343
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,580
<font color="yellow">Wait out here.</font>

345
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,220
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

346
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,570
<font color="yellow">How could you do that, Hye In?</font>

347
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,200
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyun Woo?</font>

348
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,750
<font color="yellow">I'll let you deliver Hyun Woo
to Hye In with your own hands.</font>

349
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,440
<font color="yellow">So, let go of me and let's talk.</font>

350
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,800
<font color="yellow">You want to know how I
could do that to Hye In?</font>

351
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,150
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

352
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,730
<font color="yellow">How do you think I found about
Hye In's retirement plans?</font>

353
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,620
<font color="yellow">And all of those details?</font>

354
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,010
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

355
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,080
<font color="yellow">It was the hidden camera footage that
you sold to her stalkers online.</font>

356
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,320
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong bought one of them.</font>

357
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,140
<font color="yellow">That's how I found out about those
hidden cameras.</font>

358
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,160
<font color="yellow">So, you have some responsibility in
Hyun Woo's kidnapping.</font>

359
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,470
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm giving you a chance to
fix this yourself.</font>

360
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,640
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

361
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,390
<font color="yellow">You know President Ham Tae Seob
of SG Life?</font>

362
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,240
<font color="yellow">He's meeting a congressman
for dinner tonight.</font>

363
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,500
<font color="yellow">Kidnap him.</font>

364
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,400
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with Hyun Woo?</font>

365
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,880
<font color="yellow">You need to get that done.</font>

366
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,810
<font color="yellow">Also, don't tell anyone
until the show is over.</font>

367
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,060
<font color="yellow">Then once the show ends...</font>

368
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,180
<font color="yellow">I will tell you where Hyun Woo is.</font>

369
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,920
<font color="yellow">That's when you can take him to Hye In.</font>

370
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,580
<font color="yellow">How can I trust you?
Even Hye In manipulated me.</font>

371
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,570
<font color="yellow">She hasn't contacted me even once.</font>

372
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,530
<font color="yellow">It's your choice whether
or not you trust me.</font>

373
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,250
<font color="yellow">This is your only chance to fix
your relationship with Jung Hye In.</font>

374
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,670
<font color="yellow">The VIP guest is gone!
Check the parking lot.</font>

375
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,220
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

376
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,910
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

377
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:21,600
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

378
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,390
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted starts now.</font>

379
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,990
<font color="yellow"><i>[KEEP THIS SHOW ON THE AIR NO MATTER WHAT
IF YOU WANT HYUN WOO TO LIVE.]</i></font>

380
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,510
<font color="yellow">We have two more missions left.</font>

381
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,900
<font color="yellow">This is the ninth mission
sent by the kidnapper.</font>

382
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,300
<font color="yellow">Do not stop the show.</font>

383
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,300
<font color="yellow">That was it.</font>

384
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,790
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

385
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,590
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

386
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,490
<font color="yellow">This is a video feed being sent
to us by the kidnapper</font>

387
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,810
<font color="yellow">from an unknown location.</font>

388
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,430
<font color="yellow">There is a person locked in
what looks to be a walk-in fridge.</font>

389
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,820
<font color="yellow">Who, exactly, is this person?</font>

390
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,520
<font color="yellow">And why has the kidnapper locked him up?</font>

391
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,470
<font color="yellow">Is anyone out there?</font>

392
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,060
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

393
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,680
<font color="yellow">Turn on the sound.</font>

394
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,280
<font color="yellow"><i>Turn on the monitor.</i></font>

395
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,000
<font color="yellow"><i>There is a remote control there.</i></font>

396
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,140
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

397
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,810
<font color="yellow">Who are you!</font>

398
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,820
<font color="yellow"><i>Turn it on.</i></font>

399
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,800
<font color="yellow">What do you think Jung Hye In
is feeling, standing there?</font>

400
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,020
<font color="yellow">It's her son's kidnapper and
the man who murdered her husband.</font>

401
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,220
<font color="yellow">She has to deal with them both at once.</font>

402
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,740
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob.</font>

403
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,720
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

404
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,310
<font color="yellow">When this program began,
the police started their search for you.</font>

405
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,640
<font color="yellow">If you tell us the details
of your kidnapping</font>

406
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,970
<font color="yellow">I believe it will help with the search.</font>

407
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,890
<font color="yellow"><i>I was in the restroom of the restaurant.</i></font>

408
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,360
<font color="yellow">It was around 8:00 p.m.</font>

409
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,560
<font color="yellow">I was attacked by a man dressed
in a cleaner's uniform.</font>

410
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,190
<font color="yellow">Once I woke up, I was in here.</font>

411
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,690
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you remember his face?</i></font>

412
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,050
<font color="yellow">He came up behind me when
I was washing my hands.</font>

413
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,880
<font color="yellow">I only got a glance through the mirror
and he was wearing a mask</font>

414
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,440
<font color="yellow">He wasn't that tall.</font>

415
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,190
<font color="yellow">It happened so fast.
I don't have much more.</font>

416
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,840
<font color="yellow">We would like to ask the police for help.</font>

417
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,890
<font color="yellow">We hope that you can find him quickly
using Ham Tae Seob's statement.</font>

418
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,560
<font color="yellow">I don't think this method
will help me find him in time.</font>

419
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,690
<font color="yellow">He's using a server in Bangladesh.</font>

420
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,830
<font color="yellow">I don't think Choi Joon Gu and Hyun Woo</font>

421
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,980
<font color="yellow">are necessarily at
that refrigeration unit.</font>

422
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,420
<font color="yellow">We need to find out where Hyun Woo or
Choi Joon Gu are first, not Ham Tae Seob.</font>

423
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,830
<font color="yellow">The investigation will
focus on Ham Tae Seob.</font>

424
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,650
<font color="yellow">This man that has been kidnapped and
confined in this video is...</font>

425
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,940
<font color="yellow">President of SG Life, Ham Tae Seob.</font>

426
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,560
<font color="yellow">The voice that came over the speakers to
demand Ham Tae Seob turn on the monitor</font>

427
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,870
<font color="yellow">is the voice of the kidnapper
that took Hyun Woo.</font>

428
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:49,240
<font color="yellow">He did not demand anything today,
except to continue on with the show.</font>

429
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,750
<font color="yellow"><i>Starting now, Ham Tae Seob
will have to tell the truth.</i></font>

430
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Hye In.</i></font>

431
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,160
<font color="yellow"><i>Ask Ham Tae Seob anything
you're curious about.</i></font>

432
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,190
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob.</font>

433
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,380
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

434
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,460
<font color="yellow">Why do you think the kidnapper has
brought you there and is doing this?</font>

435
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,670
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm very curious too.</i></font>

436
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,220
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know why he's doing this to me.</i></font>

437
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,520
<font color="yellow">Should we ask him about all
the missions starting from the first?</font>

438
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,550
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think that's
what Joon Gu wants.</font>

439
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,840
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

440
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,980
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu didn't give you questions.</font>

441
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,220
<font color="yellow">Think about why he told you to
ask what you're curious about.</font>

442
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,970
<font color="yellow">What do you really want
to ask Ham Tae Seob?</font>

443
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,030
<font color="yellow">We learned on the last episode.</font>

444
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,870
<font color="yellow">SG hired Jo Nam Chul
to kill Ham Tae Young.</font>

445
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:16,890
<font color="yellow">It's our theory that he was killed after
Ham Tae Young secretly met Na Jae Hyun.</font>

446
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,360
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun was looking into</font>

447
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,600
<font color="yellow">the cause of his sister's
acute interstitial pneumonia.</font>

448
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,900
<font color="yellow">He believed that it was the air purifier
humidifier produced by SG Chemical.</font>

449
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,010
<font color="yellow"><i>These documents show that he
informed Ham Tae Young.</i></font>

450
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,130
<font color="yellow"><i>Our team was able to obtain them.</i></font>

451
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Once Ham Tae Young found out about it</i></font>

452
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,260
<font color="yellow">he followed his conscience
and admitted SG Chemical had done wrong.</font>

453
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,410
<font color="yellow">He wanted a proper investigation
and to apologize.</font>

454
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,250
<font color="yellow">He planned on compensating
those who were affected.</font>

455
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Now, I will ask Ham Tae Seob a question.</i></font>

456
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,200
<font color="yellow">At that time, you were
the President of SG Chemical.</font>

457
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,680
<font color="yellow">Did you have Ham Tae Young murdered
to cover up what your company did?</font>

458
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,580
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that I...</font>

459
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,840
<font color="yellow">You're saying that...</font>

460
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,050
<font color="yellow">I would kill my little brother
over the company's profit?</font>

461
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,160
<font color="yellow">That is too awful to even imagine.</font>

462
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,620
<font color="yellow"><i>How could I do that to my Tae Young?</i></font>

464
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,560
<font color="yellow">Today's show isn't going to be easy?</font>

465
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,400
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi wants
Ham Tae Seob to confess his crimes.</font>

466
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
<font color="yellow">How will we get him to do it
if he's acting this way?</font>

467
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,260
<font color="yellow">He probably knew that Ham Tae Seob
wouldn't admit to it.</font>

468
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,480
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu must have expected that much.</font>

469
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,470
<font color="yellow">At this rate...</font>

470
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,250
<font color="yellow">he's going to do something rash if
Ham Tae Seob keeps denying it.</font>

471
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,600
<font color="yellow">Let's not worry about Joon Gu
doing something rash.</font>

472
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
<font color="yellow">We need to find a way
to shake up Ham Tae Seob.</font>

473
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,820
<font color="yellow">We'll find a way to shake him
if we keep questioning him.</font>

474
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,220
<font color="yellow">Something's been bothering me.</font>

475
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,010
<font color="yellow">I'm bringing it up in case
you know something.</font>

476
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,590
<font color="yellow">I saw Reporter Jang Jin Woong going
into President Song's office earlier.</font>

477
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,670
<font color="yellow">I checked and it was empty.</font>

478
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,610
<font color="yellow">He was in there too long
to check in on an empty office.</font>

479
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,810
<font color="yellow">I think Na Soo Hyun and Lee Ji Eun</font>

480
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,420
<font color="yellow">are Executive Director Choi's
only accomplices.</font>

481
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,280
<font color="yellow">Even after Na Soo Hyun was exposed</font>

482
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,730
<font color="yellow">he was the one who
still delivered the missions.</font>

483
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,240
<font color="yellow">But, it would've been
hard for Choi Joon Gu</font>

484
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,750
<font color="yellow">to kidnap Ham Tae Seob himself.</font>

485
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,090
<font color="yellow">He could have used Jang Jin Woong
to get his plan accomplished.</font>

486
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,670
<font color="yellow">President Song's office?</font>

487
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,600
<font color="yellow">Did you get anything
from President Song's audio file?</font>

488
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,130
<font color="yellow">No, there really much.</font>

489
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,690
<font color="yellow">There's the study, bedroom,
and his office.</font>

490
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,270
<font color="yellow">Those hidden cameras were
put there by Kwon Kyung Hoon.</font>

491
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,280
<font color="yellow">- Jung Hye In's manager?
- Yes.</font>

492
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,510
<font color="yellow">If Jung Hye In can persuade
Kwon Kyung Hoon one more time</font>

493
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,480
<font color="yellow">then she might be able to find out
what Jang Jin Woong did.</font>

494
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,880
<font color="yellow"><i>[SG CHEMICAL, AIR PURIFIER HUMIDIFIER,
MURDER, KEEP REPEATING.]</i></font>

495
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,050
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you one more thing.</font>

496
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,010
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, the kidnapper made a demand.</font>

497
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,270
<font color="yellow">We were told to reveal
that his accomplice Na Soo Hyun</font>

498
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,530
<font color="yellow">was killed by SG Group.</font>

499
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,980
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun had a sister Na Young Hyun.</font>

500
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,210
<font color="yellow">She died from the use of SG's humidifier.</font>

501
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,680
<font color="yellow"><i>Na Jae Hyun tried to expose this.</i></font>

502
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,270
<font color="yellow"><i>It is claimed that he was
killed by SG seven years ago.</i></font>

503
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,490
<font color="yellow">That means that all three siblings
were killed due to SG Chemical.</font>

504
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,670
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this true?</i></font>

505
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,200
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In and the Wanted
team continue to keep this up.</font>

506
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,760
<font color="yellow">You bring murder and conspiracy to
murder from seven years ago.</font>

507
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,710
<font color="yellow">These are very serious
criminal accusations.</font>

508
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,260
<font color="yellow">A child was kidnapped.</font>

509
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,810
<font color="yellow">Then he held this child hostage
to get a show produced.</font>

510
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,800
<font color="yellow">This man is a murderer who killed
several people in a matter of days.</font>

511
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,310
<font color="yellow">Yet, you put his words on air
as if they are established facts?</font>

512
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:35,290
<font color="yellow">Furthermore, I've been informed that
Executive Director Choi Joon Gu...</font>

513
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,520
<font color="yellow">is the kidnapper.</font>

514
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,210
<font color="yellow">I am very worried about
the adverse effects this show</font>

515
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,350
<font color="yellow">will have on our society.</font>

516
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,930
<font color="yellow"><i>Can we really continue doing this show?</i></font>

517
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:53,370
<font color="yellow"><i>You do not verify the things
that the kidnapper tells you.</i></font>

518
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Then you repeat them on air.</i></font>

519
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,850
<font color="yellow">And why did you not tell
people about Choi Joon Gu?</font>

520
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,760
<font color="yellow">Is there any chance that there is another
accomplice on the broadcast team?</font>

521
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,760
<font color="yellow">I would like to apologize to the viewers.</font>

522
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,040
<font color="yellow">Like Ham Tae Seob has told you</font>

523
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,470
<font color="yellow">we learned right after that show.</font>

524
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,500
<font color="yellow">We found out the identity
of Hyun Woo's kidnapper.</font>

525
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:27,220
<font color="yellow">It was Wanted's Executive Director,
Choi Joon Gu.</font>

526
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,990
<font color="yellow"><i>He is the kidnapper
who made this show happen.</i></font>

527
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,640
<font color="yellow">We're in control of this.
Don't let Ham Tae Seob set the pace.</font>

528
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,800
<font color="yellow">Make a clean apology and
get the atmosphere calm.</font>

529
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,650
<font color="yellow">Of course...</font>

530
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,410
<font color="yellow">I am still in shock from that trauma.</font>

531
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,480
<font color="yellow">However, I am sure of one thing.</font>

532
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,190
<font color="yellow">I am standing here
for Hyun Woo and his safety.</font>

533
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,100
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

534
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,000
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to Jung Hye In.</font>

535
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,680
<font color="yellow">Okay, you can. Over here.</font>

536
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,910
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, it seems that Jang Jin Woong
helped out Executive Director Choi today.</font>

537
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,100
<font color="yellow">He went into President Song's office
and did something alone.</font>

538
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,500
<font color="yellow">I think it was filmed
on the hidden camera</font>

539
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,890
<font color="yellow">that Kwon Kyung Hoon put in there.</font>

540
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,220
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can find out
from Kwon Kyung Hoon?</font>

541
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,550
<font color="yellow">She's saying she's
going contact him, right?</font>

542
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,610
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

543
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,670
<font color="yellow">Do we have other footage?
We can't turn off Ham Tae Seob.</font>

544
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,650
<font color="yellow">- Turn on what we prepared.
- Okay.</font>

545
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,690
<font color="yellow">I can give you five minutes.
Try to get it done by then.</font>

546
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,210
<font color="yellow">Put up this caption.</font>

<font color="yellow">He kidnapped Hyun Woo.</font>

577
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,530
<font color="yellow">Then Choi Joon Gu demanded
that we create this show.</font>

<font color="yellow">I will ask Ham Tae Seob
the same question I first asked him.</font>

585
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,240
<font color="yellow">I am a victim.</font>

586
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:16,190
<font color="yellow">It is victims who often ask themselves,
"Why did this happen to me?"</font>

587
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,820
<font color="yellow">They ask themselves that often.</font>

588

tried to cover up the crimes.</font>

<font color="yellow">you were president of
SG Chemical at the time.</font>

594

you were responsible.</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't you suppose that is
why the kidnapper did all of this?</font>

596
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:51,030
<font color="yellow">Do you admit that there was a problem
with the air purifier humidifier?</font>

because of a few claims.</font>

603
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,190
<font color="yellow">The people making these claims
should prove it scientifically.</font>

again very thoroughly.</font>
