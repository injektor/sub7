I'll go get her.</font>

with his mother-in-law.</font>

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,040

dangerous happens, can you do it?</font>

115

<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

116
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,750

152
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,070
<font color="yellow">Tell them all to come in here.</font>

153
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,720
<font color="yellow">- Now.
- Yes, I will.</font>

154
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,440
<font color="yellow">I should go to the station and
finish things up.</font>

155
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,460
<font color="yellow">You should rest.</font>

156
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,170
<font color="yellow">They're all retired cops,
but they'll protect you well.</font>

157
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,590
<font color="yellow">I would use active police,
but I don't know who works for SG.</font>

158
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,260
<font color="yellow">These people are trustworthy.</font>

159
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,240
<font color="yellow">We'll protect this place.</font>

160
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,400
<font color="yellow">You should go home. Go on in.</font>

161
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

162
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,870
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

163
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,640
<font color="yellow">You know that you can't.</font>

164
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,570
<font color="yellow">I'm asking as a favor.</font>

165
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,640
<font color="yellow">I need to hear what he has left to say.</font>

166
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,010
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't people who've been
watching need to hear from him too?</font>

167
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,560
<font color="yellow">We've found Hyun Woo now.</font>

168
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,220
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu wasn't just a kidnapper either.</font>

169
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,870
<font color="yellow">You saw it too, Lieutenant Park.</font>

170
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,830
<font color="yellow">Keep it quick.</font>

171
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,960
<font color="yellow">I came for the show.</font>

172
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
<font color="yellow">I'm here to film anything
more you have to say.</font>

173
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,150
<font color="yellow">Did they find him? Did he meet Hye In?</font>

174
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,110
<font color="yellow">It's all over now.</font>

175
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,840
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I have nothing more to say.</font>

176
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,210
<font color="yellow">Anything...</font>

177
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,960
<font color="yellow">You can say anything.</font>

178
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,980
<font color="yellow">Anything I have left to say
I should say to Hye In.</font>

179
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,170
<font color="yellow">Should I call Hye In for you?</font>

180
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,630
<font color="yellow">Hye In won't want to come.</font>

181
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,840
<font color="yellow">Do you have any other evidence
beside what you already told us about?</font>

182
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,980
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

183
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,430
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I'll put it on air.</font>

184
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,870
<font color="yellow">I don't think the show you did today
is what you originally wanted.</font>

185
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,550
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to confirm that.</font>

186
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,730
<font color="yellow">There was a doctor that researched,
ran tests, and wrote his own report.</font>

187
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,910
<font color="yellow">He had other evidence too.</font>

188
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,350
<font color="yellow">We were supposed to meet three days ago,
but then I didn't hear from him.</font>

189
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,530
<font color="yellow">He hadn't done anything wrong.</font>

190
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to put him in danger.</font>

191
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,010
<font color="yellow">A doctor?</font>

192
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,670
<font color="yellow"><i>Today in Bongdam, Hwaseong at 9:00 p.m.</i></font>

193
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,770
<font color="yellow"><i>a Mister Kim was
discovered in a reservoir.</i></font>

194
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,200
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

195
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,550
<font color="yellow"><i>An area man discovered the body
and called the police.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Police and fire department were able
to recover him.</i></font>

197
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,270
<font color="yellow">Is that him?</font>

198
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,670
<font color="yellow">What the heck is that?</font>

199
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Police believe that he committed suicide
and are looking into the case.</i></font>

200
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,330
<font color="yellow"><i>Police also believe that Mister Kim was a
doctor at a hospital seven years ago.</i></font>

201
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,270
<font color="yellow"><i>He had disappeared suddenly
and could not be found.</i></font>

202
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,440
<font color="yellow"><i>His family has been told of his death.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">Dong Wook.</font>

204
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,340
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you for one last favor.</font>

205
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

206
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,410
<font color="yellow">Did you see that tape I gave you?</font>

207
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,270
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

208
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,800
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

209
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,510
<font color="yellow">You'll know when you see it.</font>

210
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,090
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

211
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,310
<font color="yellow">When you make a show about this
on your own later on...</font>

212
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,140
<font color="yellow">please make sure to use this.</font>

214
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,280
<font color="yellow">I saw it.</font>

215
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,480
<font color="yellow">I made a mistake.</font>

216
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,060
<font color="yellow">With what?</font>

217
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,500
<font color="yellow">I said to you long ago that if I ever
asked you not to air something</font>

218
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,570
<font color="yellow">I needed you to listen to me just once.</font>

219
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,020
<font color="yellow">Do you remember that?</font>

220
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,520
<font color="yellow">I remember.</font>

221
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,220
<font color="yellow">Don't put that tape on air.</font>

222
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,230
<font color="yellow">You asked me to put it on air.</font>

223
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,050
<font color="yellow">I thought that I had to.</font>

224
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,090
<font color="yellow">I think I was wrong.</font>

225
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,740
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

226
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,990
<font color="yellow">People might watch it.</font>

227
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,870
<font color="yellow">What if they pity my even
just a little bit?</font>

228
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,460
<font color="yellow">What if they think I...</font>

229
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,580
<font color="yellow">I don't think it'll be right if people
pardon me for what I've done.</font>

230
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,380
<font color="yellow">I don't know about anything else.</font>

231
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,200
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have done that to Hyun Woo.</font>

232
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,020
<font color="yellow">What I've done...</font>

233
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,510
<font color="yellow">So, why?</font>

234
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,330
<font color="yellow">You won't air that tape, right?</font>

235
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,060
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

236
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,160
<font color="yellow">But, later on...</font>

237
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,370
<font color="yellow">I might create something of my own.</font>

238
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
<font color="yellow">I might use it then.</font>

239
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,580
<font color="yellow">This is all I can do for you, Joon Gu.</font>

240
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,220
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

241
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,170
<font color="yellow">He wasn't stabbed on purpose.</font>

242
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,910
<font color="yellow">He was cut while they were fighting.</font>

243
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,410
<font color="yellow">Then will he be okay?</font>

244
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, he'll need treatment for a few days,
and he'll have to take care of himself.</font>

245
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,080
<font color="yellow">The issue of Choi Joon Gu's
injuries are very clear-cut.</font>

246
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,800
<font color="yellow">You will be asked a few questions
as a formality once you are better.</font>

247
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,030
<font color="yellow">Get it over with as soon as possible.</font>

248
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

249
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,210
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

250
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,810
<font color="yellow">- You can go.
- Okay.</font>

251
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,600
<font color="yellow">Did that doctor have anything?</font>

252
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,400
<font color="yellow">According to our investigations,
Kim Bong Joon had a report with proof.</font>

253
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,960
<font color="yellow">On top of that</font>

254
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,110
<font color="yellow">he has evidence that SG Chemical</font>

255
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,260
<font color="yellow">knew tests had to be run
on the the PHMC toxicity.</font>

256
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,960
<font color="yellow">He was in possession of that, as well.</font>

257
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,220
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

258
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,590
<font color="yellow">Where is that evidence now?</font>

259
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,950
<font color="yellow">Well, that is...</font>

260
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,220
<font color="yellow">What if the police or broadcast team
get their hands on it first?</font>

261
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,710
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can fix it?</font>

262
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,950
<font color="yellow">I will make sure nothing
like that ever happens.</font>

263
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,600
<font color="yellow">Is this the end?</font>

264
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,680
<font color="yellow">What about any other
plans or accomplices?</font>

265
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,360
<font color="yellow">It was about a year ago.</font>

266
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,050
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't sleep, day or night.</font>

267
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,510
<font color="yellow">He was holed up in his room saying
he was going to make a bomb.</font>

268
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,850
<font color="yellow">He ended up with a burn on
his hand and gave up.</font>

269
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,610
<font color="yellow">What about the bomb Park Sae Yong
was making a year ago?</font>

270
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,750
<font color="yellow">Is that not connected to this?</font>

271
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,390
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong.</font>

272
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,720
<font color="yellow">That was when he first met Mister Choi.</font>

273
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,350
<font color="yellow">He found out that his mom was sick
because of that air purifying humidifier.</font>

274
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,460
<font color="yellow">He was so angry that he tried
to make a bomb by himself.</font>

275
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,030
<font color="yellow">But, he failed.</font>

276
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,470
<font color="yellow">Mister met him and convinced him
with plans of doing this show.</font>

277
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,170
<font color="yellow">How did you end up
getting involved in this?</font>

278
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,900
<font color="yellow">Was it after Park Sae Yong kidnapped you?</font>

279
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,820
<font color="yellow">You looked truly afraid in the video.</font>

280
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,460
<font color="yellow">Soo Hyun, Mister Choi, and I
had been preparing for a long time.</font>

281
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,730
<font color="yellow">As for the kidnapping,
I knew all about it.</font>

282
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,000
<font color="yellow">But, I was so scared when the time came.</font>

283
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,740
<font color="yellow">I started to doubt Mister
and Park Sae Yong.</font>

284
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,680
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself...</font>

285
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,760
<font color="yellow">is this really starting now?</font>

286
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,870
<font color="yellow">How do you feel now?</font>

287
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,010
<font color="yellow">Do you regret it?</font>

288
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,580
<font color="yellow">I'm not really sure.</font>

289
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,920
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to Hyun Woo.</font>

290
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,330
<font color="yellow">And Soo Hyun...</font>

291
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,250
<font color="yellow">And Mister Choi...</font>

292
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,350
<font color="yellow">Can you let me see him just once?</font>

293
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,180
<font color="yellow">That's going to kind of difficult.</font>

294
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, you crazy kid.</font>

295
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,490
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here so late?</font>

296
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,770
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

297
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,990
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I didn't do my job properly.</font>

298
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,970
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you myself if
you go getting beat up again.</font>

299
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

300
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,600
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi's mother-in-law
got passed off to central headquarter.</font>

301

302
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,690
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for us to keep her.</font>

303
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,770
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

304
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,160
<font color="yellow">But, I think Lee Ji Eun
would be safer here.</font>

305
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,900
<font color="yellow">I'd like to keep an eye on her if we can.</font>

306
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,010
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much longer we can.</font>

307
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,470
<font color="yellow">It's getting complicated to explain it.</font>

- Where?</font>

<font color="yellow">Senior Sang Shik?</font>

314
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,790
<font color="yellow">You can walk there, right?</font>

315
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
<font color="yellow">We just need to run a few tests.</font>

316
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,070

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,110

320
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,290
<font color="yellow">I had some questions
for Executive Director Choi.</font>

321

Detective Kim Sang Shik over with?</font>

00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,440
<font color="yellow">What is he planning to do?</font>

452
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,600
<font color="yellow">He's been stabbed and
he needs to get it treated.</font>

453
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,100
<font color="yellow">That could be a big problem too.</font>

454
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,200
<font color="yellow">Do you have news
on Executive Director Choi?</font>

455
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,090
<font color="yellow">No, do you have anything from his files
that he didn't use for the show?</font>

456
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,020
<font color="yellow">We can figure out why he escaped.</font>

457
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
<font color="yellow">That's the only method.</font>

458
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,620
<font color="yellow">There's a lot that he didn't use,
but they're all similar.</font>

459
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,130
<font color="yellow">Most of them are interviews with victims
he wanted to use for his documentary.</font>

460
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,430
<font color="yellow">There are some whistle blowers
and people who tried to help.</font>

461
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,550
<font color="yellow"><i>[DETECTIVE KIM SANG SHIK]</i></font>

462
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,190
<font color="yellow">Have you seen this tape?</font>

463
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,260
<font color="yellow">No, we haven't seen that one.</font>

464
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,760
<font color="yellow">We have so many to go through and
we had covered him in an episode so...</font>

465
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,810
<font color="yellow">Can I see this now?</font>

once we go to France.</font>

468
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,850
<font color="yellow">- Hye In.
- Yes?</font>

469
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,780
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

470
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,790
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

471
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,350
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

472
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,120
<font color="yellow">You're in a rush.
This won't fit the baby for a long time.</font>

473
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,600
<font color="yellow">Also, what if it's a boy?</font>

474
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,040
<font color="yellow">That's why... tada!</font>

475
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's so cute.</font>

476
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,910
<font color="yellow">You have to put these shoes on our
daughter on her first birthday.</font>

477
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

478
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,820
<font color="yellow">Tell her it's the first pair
of shoes that her dad bought.</font>

479
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,240
<font color="yellow">You have to tell her.</font>

480
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,310
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

481
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,120
<font color="yellow">You can put them on for her
and tell her yourself.</font>

482
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,320
<font color="yellow">Right, I can.</font>

483
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,820
<font color="yellow">And why do you keep saying daughter?</font>

484
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,680
<font color="yellow">If it's a son, his feelings
might be hurt.</font>

485
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Why do you need to film this?</i></font>

486
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Move that thing, would you?</i></font>

487
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,330
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't focus with that thing around.</i></font>

488
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,230
<font color="yellow"><i>I have to keep a record of everything.</i></font>

489
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,980
<font color="yellow">If anything were to happen to me,
this is the only way to tell the story.</font>

490
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,750
<font color="yellow">I'll go and park the car at a distance.
You should leave.</font>

491
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,630
<font color="yellow">How can I send you there on your own?</font>

492
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just don't get in my way.</font>

493
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,870
<font color="yellow">Those guys... they're scary people.</font>

494
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,150
<font color="yellow">Ko Hyung Joon said Im Hyung Soon
was an informant.</font>

495
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,500
<font color="yellow">He didn't go because he didn't
think he should pursue this case?</font>

496
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,950
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

497
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,140
<font color="yellow">That guy is calculating.</font>

498
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,940
<font color="yellow">According to what you found out</font>

499
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,910
<font color="yellow">Im Hyung Soon and Jo Nam Chul
are working together.</font>

500
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,690
<font color="yellow">There's something called
a hunting website.</font>

501
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,250
<font color="yellow">It connects people to hit men.</font>

502
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,740
<font color="yellow">Im Hyung Soon made that site.</font>

503
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,490
<font color="yellow">I think he made it to con people,
in the beginning.</font>

504
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,240
<font color="yellow">The money was so good.</font>

505
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,980
<font color="yellow">So, he got Jo Nam Chul
to really kill people.</font>

506
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,230
<font color="yellow">They didn't know each other before that?</font>

507
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,320
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

508
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,560
<font color="yellow"><i>But, once he actually witnessed it</i></font>

509
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,210
<font color="yellow"><i>I think he thought he might
get killed too and got scared.</i></font>

510
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,510
<font color="yellow"><i>He wants to run to another country
and become an informant.</i></font>

511
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,990
<font color="yellow"><i>You said that SG sent someone
who gave you a warning.</i></font>

512
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,570
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if it's not SG,
that stuff is common.</i></font>

513
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,860
<font color="yellow"><i>Then this could be a trap.</i></font>

514
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if it is a trap,
I won't be able to catch them otherwise.</i></font>

515
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,440
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why I'm going.</i></font>

516
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,820
<font color="yellow"><i>Then call up your team members
and go with them.</i></font>

517
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,940
<font color="yellow"><i>If Seung In finds out,
it will be a big problem.</i></font>

518
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,230
<font color="yellow"><i>That kid will walk through fire.</i></font>

519
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,130
<font color="yellow"><i>Suppose they do get caught,
it will still be a long battle.</i></font>

520
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,640
<font color="yellow"><i>That kid is just starting out.</i></font>

521
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,750
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't want this to
get in the way of his future.</i></font>

522
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,870
<font color="yellow"><i>What about you, Detective?</i></font>

523
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,720
<font color="yellow"><i>I already found out about it.</i></font>

524
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,620
<font color="yellow"><i>Things already worked out this way.
There's nothing I can do now.</i></font>

525
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,070
<font color="yellow"><i>I am a detective, after all.</i></font>

526
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,430
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm a person whose job
it is to do these things.</i></font>

527
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,980
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to go somewhere?</font>

528
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,140
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the broadcast station.</font>

529
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,060
<font color="yellow">Something came up that I need to do.</font>

530
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,310
<font color="yellow">It isn't safe to go anywhere now.</font>

531
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,850
<font color="yellow">Do you have to go?</font>

532
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,030
<font color="yellow">This is something that I started.</font>

533
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,960
<font color="yellow">So, I should finish it.</font>

534
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,890
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you.</font>

535
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,210
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

536
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,700
<font color="yellow">I'm going to step out for a little bit.</font>

537
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,690
<font color="yellow">You can stay here with
these aunties, right?</font>

538
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,280
<font color="yellow">Can't I come with you?</font>

539
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

540
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,020
<font color="yellow">I'll be back very soon.</font>

541
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,320
<font color="yellow">But, I'm scared.</font>

542
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:52,130
<font color="yellow">Right outside, the policemen that you
like are protecting you too.</font>

543
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,320
<font color="yellow">Stay here with your aunties for a
little while, okay?</font>

544
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,430
<font color="yellow">I'll be back very soon.</font>

545
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,170
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Hyun Woo. I'll stay here with you.</font>

546
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,010
<font color="yellow">It's okay here. It's safe.</font>

547
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,640
<font color="yellow">Go on. It won't be long, right?</font>

548
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,430
<font color="yellow">Of course, not.</font>

549
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,770
<font color="yellow">I'll just be ten minutes at the cafe.</font>

550
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,960
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

551
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,150
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

552
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,390
<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

553
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

554
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,960
<font color="yellow">What about Hyun Woo?</font>

555
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,500
<font color="yellow">Don't even say Hyun Woo's name.</font>

556
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,320
<font color="yellow">I really am sorry.</font>

557
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,720
<font color="yellow">I'm truly sorry.</font>

558
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,160
<font color="yellow">After you kidnapped Hyun Woo</font>

559
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,540
<font color="yellow">I thought about it
every day for hours.</font>

560
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,830
<font color="yellow">Why me?</font>

561
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,050
<font color="yellow">Why my Hyun Woo?</font>

562
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,140
<font color="yellow">Why did something like this happen to us?</font>

563
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,690
<font color="yellow">Is it really because
I've done something wrong?</font>

564
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,390
<font color="yellow">Did I do something even worse than
the people who've been on our show?</font>

565
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,570
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

566
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,560
<font color="yellow">I was too severe, but...</font>

567
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,600
<font color="yellow">I had no other choice.</font>

568
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,850
<font color="yellow">You were the only one who could do it.</font>

569
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,210
<font color="yellow">When I continued thinking about it...</font>

570
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,760
<font color="yellow">I did have a sin.</font>

571
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,170
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

572
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,130
<font color="yellow">Why is this something you have to do?</font>

573
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,020
<font color="yellow">You made a promise to me.</font>

574
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,500
<font color="yellow">Once I got pregnant,
we wouldn't tell your family.</font>

575
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,560
<font color="yellow">We would move to France right away.</font>

576
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,010
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want our child
growing up lonely like you did.</font>

577
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,790
<font color="yellow">You didn't want him growing up
among those monsters.</font>

578
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,060
<font color="yellow">I'm not the one who said it.</font>

579
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,450
<font color="yellow">It was you who said those things.</font>

580
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,900
<font color="yellow">Hye In!</font>

581
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
<font color="yellow">I've been acting since I was seven.</font>

582
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,010
<font color="yellow">There's no one in this country
who doesn't know me.</font>

583
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,920
<font color="yellow">That kind of life...</font>

584
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,240
<font color="yellow">I'm throwing away everything
I've grown accustomed to.</font>

585
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,600
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to live a life
that we really want.</font>

586
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,070
<font color="yellow">You said my entire life has
been fake and it was wrong.</font>

587
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,310
<font color="yellow">You're the one who made me think it,
so how can you do this now?</font>

588
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,100
<font color="yellow"><i>We agreed to meet, Ham Tae Young.</i></font>

589
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Ham Tae Young!
You're all I have, you know that!</i></font>

590
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,660
<font color="yellow"><i>You're the only one who can do this.</i></font>

591
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,000
<font color="yellow"><i>You're the only one who can
investigate and apologize for this.</i></font>

592
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,710
<font color="yellow"><i>You're the one who can rescue people
who don't know anything and are dying.</i></font>

593
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Please.</i></font>

594
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Ham Tae Young!
I know you can do it. Please.</i></font>

595
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,850
<font color="yellow"><i>You... you promised me you would.</i></font>

596
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,380

598
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,050

telling you the truth or not.</font>

599

<font color="yellow">You could be getting fooled.</font>

600
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,910

whether or not that's true!</font>

601

606
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,780
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

607
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,220
<font color="yellow">This is my task.</font>

608
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,390
<font color="yellow">I have to be responsible for it.</font>

609

610
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,670
<font color="yellow">Is it me and the baby?</font>

611
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,000
<font color="yellow">Or those people you don't know?</font>

622
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,330
<font color="yellow">He was going to take responsibility.</font>

623
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,240

a proper investigation.</font>

624
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,400
<font color="yellow">And reveal the truth about it all.</font>

628
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,730

629
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:27,330

like a human being will take the baby.</font>

630
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,180

or take the child away.</font>

who lost loved ones so unfairly.</font>

636

<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young, you have a
responsibility for that too.</font>

637
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,800
<font color="yellow">I know, but still...</font>

638
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,850
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

639
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,870
<font color="yellow">I can't let this happen.</font>

640
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,030
<font color="yellow">I can't tell my wife about this
or drag her into this.</font>

641
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,970
<font color="yellow">She is getting so worried.</font>

642

<font color="yellow">I didn't know Tae Young did that.</font>

646
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,700
<font color="yellow">Then he went to meet Na Jae Hyun.</font>

647
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,890
<font color="yellow">And died.</font>

648
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,520
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know Tae Young was trying
to expose something like this.</font>

649
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,420
<font color="yellow">He didn't want you involved in it.</font>

650
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,920
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

651
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,600
