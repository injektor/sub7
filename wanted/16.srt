<font color="yellow">I have no intention
of apologizing to you.</font>

3
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:11,367
<font color="yellow">I'm not looking for redemption either.</font>

4
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,996
<font color="yellow">When I think about what
you did to my Hyun Woo...</font>

5
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,016
<font color="yellow">I can't forgive you even if I die.</font>

6
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,496
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

7
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,276
<font color="yellow">You need to pay for your crimes now.</font>

8
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:32,797
<font color="yellow">As for me...</font>

9
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:38,242
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do what I can.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Suppose they do get caught,
it will still be a long battle.</i></font>

11
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,105
<font color="yellow">That kid is just starting out.</font>

12
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:54,872
<font color="yellow">I don't want this to get
in the way of his future.</font>

13
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:56,293
<font color="yellow">What about you, Detective?</font>

14
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,959
<font color="yellow">I already found out about it.</font>

15
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,777
<font color="yellow"><i>Things already worked out this way.
There's nothing I can do now.</i></font>

16
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:03,438
<font color="yellow"><i>I am a detective, after all.</i></font>

17
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:07,855
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm a person whose job it is
to do these things.</i></font>

18
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,848
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait. Hye In.</font>

19
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,307
<font color="yellow">I... what do I do?</font>

20
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,757
<font color="yellow">I never meant to hurt
people in the beginning.</font>

21
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,087
<font color="yellow">There is one last thing I have to do.</font>

22
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,661
<font color="yellow">It can't end like this.</font>

23
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,539
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha.</font>

24
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:45,024
<font color="yellow">You have to catch
Executive Director Choi.</font>

25
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,414
<font color="yellow">You have to.</font>

26
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,031
<font color="yellow"><i>You can do that, right?</i></font>

27
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,467
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

28
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:02,453
<font color="yellow">If Senior is trying to do
one last thing...</font>

29
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:05,162
<font color="yellow">I hope that he can do it.</font>

30
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,832
<font color="yellow">What he was originally planning to do...</font>

31
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,802
<font color="yellow">I hope he can achieve that.</font>

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,797
<font color="yellow">I should finish things off too.</font>

33
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,142
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm going
to do the tenth episode.</font>

36
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,539

<font color="yellow">Hye In.</font>

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,612
<font color="yellow">This moment right now...</font>

39
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:48,062

Will you be okay?</i></font>

41
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,187
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy going back on TV.</font>

42
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,570
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I'm scared.</font>

43
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,120
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do it.</font>

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,324
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

45
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,574
<font color="yellow">I have to do it.</font>

46
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,773
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault, Hye In.</font>

47
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,003
<font color="yellow">When I was pregnant with Hyun Woo...</font>

48
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,750
<font color="yellow">When my husband passed away...</font>

49
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:40,733
<font color="yellow">When I felt like Hyun Woo
and I would be in danger</font>

50
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,624
<font color="yellow">and I announced my retirement.</font>

51
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:46,451
<font color="yellow">I was always running away.</font>

52
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:50,463
<font color="yellow">I can't run away now.</font>

53
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,933
<font color="yellow">If I run now...</font>

54
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,314
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure I can ever escape this.</font>

55
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:03,812
<font color="yellow">There are some things you can't
escape without getting hurt.</font>

56
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,983
<font color="yellow">I will catch Choi Joon Gu.</font>

57
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,107
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you need help with anything.</font>

58
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,528
<font color="yellow">I heard from a victim of
the air purifier humidifier.</font>

59
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:22,800
<font color="yellow">Not long ago...</font>

60
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:28,331
<font color="yellow">I heard from the man who
was my daughter's doctor.</font>

61
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,571
<font color="yellow">Then, this morning...</font>

62
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:35,876
<font color="yellow">he was discovered dead in a reservoir.</font>

63
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:41,196
<font color="yellow">Can you look into that doctor?</font>

64
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,782
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if SG killed him.</font>

65
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:49,194
<font color="yellow">It's a recent event so it could
be quite harmful to them.</font>

66
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:51,581
<font color="yellow">I'll do that.</font>

67
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:00,283
<font color="yellow"><i>I came for the show.</i></font>

68
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,206
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm here to film anything
more you have to say.</i></font>

69
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Forget it. I have nothing more to say.</i></font>

70
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,006
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not saying I'll put it on air.</i></font>

71
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:13,379
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't think the show you did today
is what you originally wanted.</i></font>

72
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,725
<font color="yellow"><i>I just wanted to confirm that.</i></font>

73
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:22,770
<font color="yellow"><i>There was a doctor that researched,
ran tests, and wrote his own report.</i></font>

74
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:25,381
<font color="yellow">He had other evidence too.</font>

75
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,812
<font color="yellow">We were supposed to meet three days ago,
but then I didn't hear from him.</font>

76
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,302
<font color="yellow">He hadn't done anything wrong.</font>

77
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,883
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to put him in danger.</font>

78
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:38,047
<font color="yellow"><i>A local resident discovered
the body and called the police.</i></font>

79
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,633
<font color="yellow">What the heck is that?</font>

80
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,258
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else you didn't film?</font>

81
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,881
<font color="yellow">Did he know where
that doctor was staying?</font>

82
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:52,992
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

83
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,862
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

84
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:59,662
<font color="yellow">If he escaped to find that evidence</font>

85
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:02,864
<font color="yellow">he could be in danger of SG Group.</font>

86
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:10,383
<font color="yellow">Han Ji Yeon's daughter's doctor was
also Choi Joon Gu's wife's doctor.</font>

87
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:17,691
<font color="yellow">He had evidence to use against
the air purifier humidifier.</font>

88
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,025
<font color="yellow">But, he's been missing
for over seven years.</font>

89
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,271
<font color="yellow">He died only a few days ago.</font>

90
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:26,001
<font color="yellow">He's been on the run from SG Group.</font>

91
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,484
<font color="yellow">He saw Wanted and agreed to give
the evidence over to Choi Joon Gu.</font>

92
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:33,489
<font color="yellow">He's also been contacting victims
like Han Ji Yeon.</font>

93
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:36,300
<font color="yellow">He was looking into the current situation
and got exposed somehow.</font>

94
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,874
<font color="yellow">This is from the time Han Ji Yeon's
daughter was getting treated.</font>

95
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:46,910
<font color="yellow">This is the family contact information
for his patients with similar symptoms.</font>

96
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,400
<font color="yellow">Let's meet them all one at a time.</font>

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,855
<font color="yellow">I called them all and they
don't want to meet with us.</font>

98
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,460
<font color="yellow">They don't believe that
the doctor committed suicide.</font>

99
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,930
<font color="yellow">They're afraid.</font>

100
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,401
<font color="yellow">They've already been through a lot.</font>

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,069
<font color="yellow">It's too much to handle.</font>

102
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:04,961
<font color="yellow">This person.</font>

103
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,629
<font color="yellow">He's the only one who's willing to meet.</font>

104
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,441
<font color="yellow"><i>[Kim Tae Kyung]</i></font>

105
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,740
<font color="yellow">Let's do episode 10.</font>

106
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,730
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to do it?</font>

107
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,439
<font color="yellow">Because of Executive Director Choi?</font>

108
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:24,771
<font color="yellow">I can't say that's not why.</font>

109
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,100
<font color="yellow">But, that's not the entire reason why...</font>

110
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,271
<font color="yellow">We should do it.</font>

111
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,285
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should
end it like this either.</font>

112
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:42,292
<font color="yellow">I don't agree with his methods</font>

113
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,949
<font color="yellow">But, the issue of
the air purifier humidifier...</font>

114
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,146
<font color="yellow">It's been covered up all this time.</font>

115
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:51,758
<font color="yellow">If we don't let people know now,
it will be covered up again.</font>

116
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:56,595
<font color="yellow">I think we have that responsibility too.</font>

117
00:07:57,554 --> 00:08:00,874
<font color="yellow">We showed such harsh things
on the air all this time.</font>

118
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:03,448
<font color="yellow">If we stop now because we found Hyun Woo</font>

119
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:07,593
<font color="yellow">then we really were just
manipulating them for the show.</font>

120
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:10,694
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

121
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:15,081
<font color="yellow">do you think Senior Hye In would do it?</font>

122
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:19,550
<font color="yellow">She's found Hyun Woo now and
it's been so hard on her.</font>

123
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:30,712
<font color="yellow">We need to a tenth episode.</font>

124
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,582
<font color="yellow">We just made that decision too.</font>

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,264
<font color="yellow">Let's get Ham Tae Seob on the show.</font>

126
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:41,473
<font color="yellow">Let's prove that he conspired to murder.</font>

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,560
<font color="yellow">We need to get him to admit the issue
with the air purifier humidifier too.</font>

128
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,876
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

129
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:53,102
<font color="yellow">That's why the executive director
made the choices he did.</font>

130
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:55,969
<font color="yellow">We can't use the same tactics as before.</font>

131
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,341
<font color="yellow">This time we're not following
anyone's orders.</font>

132
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,141
<font color="yellow">We're doing it on our own.</font>

133
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,381
<font color="yellow">Have you thought about what kind
of show you want to make?</font>

134
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,189
<font color="yellow">Connect this to the TV.</font>

135
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,512
<font color="yellow">Are... are you okay?</font>

136
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,348
<font color="yellow">I have to film this.</font>

137
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,070
<font color="yellow">This is the only thing I can think of.</font>

138
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,871
<font color="yellow">There's nothing else I can do.</font>

139
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,102
<font color="yellow">I... I...</font>

140
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,122
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to find out
why this is happening to you.</font>

141
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,439
<font color="yellow">Why this is suddenly happening to you...</font>

142
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:03,083
<font color="yellow">You have oxygen
so why can't you breathe?</font>

143
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:08,574
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong with this
hospital or is it something else?</font>

144
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,392
<font color="yellow">I'm going find out.
Just hold on a little longer.</font>

145
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:14,549
<font color="yellow">I will find out for you.</font>

146
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,389
<font color="yellow">You and our baby...</font>

147
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,113
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll save you both.</i></font>

148
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,973
<font color="yellow">Hold on a little longer.</font>

149
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,617
<font color="yellow">She went into premature labor.</font>

150
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:32,392
<font color="yellow">The baby died right away
of the same illness.</font>

151
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,726
<font color="yellow">His wife died right away too.</font>

152
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:44,320
<font color="yellow">I wasn't saying we should do the last
episode to tell Senior Joon Gu's story.</font>

153
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,184
<font color="yellow">Neither was I.</font>

154
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,271
<font color="yellow">This won't go on the air.</font>

155
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,709
<font color="yellow">It will be different than
the rest of our episodes.</font>

156
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,647
<font color="yellow">What Joon Gu wanted people to know...</font>

157
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:00,642
<font color="yellow">the murders committed by SG and
the air purifier humidifier.</font>

158
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,699
<font color="yellow">I'll tell it the way Joon Gu would.</font>

159
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:06,516
<font color="yellow">The way he wanted to tell it originally.
I'll do it like that.</font>

160
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,352
<font color="yellow">No, that won't be enough.</font>

161
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:14,170
<font color="yellow">I need your style, Dong Wook.</font>

162
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,189
<font color="yellow">I still do.</font>

163
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,203
<font color="yellow">She's not wrong.</font>

164
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:22,242
<font color="yellow">To educate people,
you have to get their interest first.</font>

165
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:25,275
<font color="yellow">We can't give Ham Tae Seob
a way out either.</font>

166
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,160
<font color="yellow">It needs to be completely unexpected,
just like what we've done so far.</font>

167
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:40,582
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

168
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,988

171
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:25,245
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi, don't do this.</font>

172
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,299
<font color="yellow">Turn yourself in.</font>

173
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,889
<font color="yellow">You're putting yourself in danger.</font>

174
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,743
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything left to protect.</font>

175
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,001
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter if I'm in danger?</font>

176
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,815
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

177
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,074
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself.</font>

178
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,863
<font color="yellow">We're going to do the show.</font>

179
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:47,293
<font color="yellow">Even Lieutenant Cha agreed to help out.</font>

180
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:52,032
<font color="yellow">You don't need to go to these lengths.</font>

181
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,237
<font color="yellow">I should finish what I started.</font>

182
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,406
<font color="yellow">All this time...</font>

183
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,577
<font color="yellow">I've put you all in so much danger.</font>

184
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,186
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

185
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,764
<font color="yellow">I should get going now.</font>

186
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,160
<font color="yellow">- Director Shin will be looking for me.
- Okay.</font>

187
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:23,448
<font color="yellow">It will be almost impossible to get
Ham Tae Seob on our show.</font>

188
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,752
<font color="yellow">He was kidnapped and nearly murdered.</font>

189
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:31,544
<font color="yellow">It will come out as self-defense,
but he did stab a man on live TV.</font>

190
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,984
<font color="yellow">Also, it's obvious that he'll get
attacked if he comes on our show.</font>

191
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:40,987
<font color="yellow">If Joon Gu hadn't done that yesterday,
we would have a chance.</font>

192
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,555
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's completely impossible.</font>

193
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,862
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, I think Ham Tae Seob
believed he knew the public very well.</font>

194
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:54,362
<font color="yellow">He believes he can control
them however he wants to.</font>

195
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:57,474
<font color="yellow">From what I've seen
while married to Tae Young</font>

196
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,877
<font color="yellow">he's good at hiding his emotions.</font>

197
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:02,654
<font color="yellow">He's all about maintaining his image.</font>

198
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:06,324
<font color="yellow">He's never failed at
anything in his life.</font>

199
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,604
<font color="yellow">Then you have to use
that confidence against him.</font>

200
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,184
<font color="yellow">You can get him to appear
if you hurt his image a lot.</font>

201
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:16,074
<font color="yellow">He won't be able to handle
his image being destroyed.</font>

202
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:20,356
<font color="yellow">He'll want to resolve it himself and
he believes that he can resolve it.</font>

203
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:23,713
<font color="yellow">Still, how can we come up
with an issue that big?</font>

204
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,353
<font color="yellow">Theories or claims are not good enough.</font>

205
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,484
<font color="yellow">I have something.</font>

206
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:47,323
<font color="yellow">It won't do any good as legal evidence.</font>

207
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,663
<font color="yellow">I have something good enough
to stir up the public.</font>

208
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:54,572
<font color="yellow">Maybe Tae Young was worried that
something would happen to him.</font>

209
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:58,933
<font color="yellow">He left an audio file of a conversation
he had with Ham Tae Seob.</font>

210
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,176
<font color="yellow">I found it yesterday.</font>

215

<font color="yellow">Yet, you want to start investigating,
give money, and compensate?</font>

216

<font color="yellow">It won't be just that product.
All of SG's products will suffer.</font>

217

<font color="yellow">You're my little brother.</font>

221
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,506

222
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:37,078
<font color="yellow">You grew up like a fine prince.</font>

223
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:39,439

and playing hero.</font>

224
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,846
<font color="yellow">Sure, I can overlook
that as a cute thing.</font>

225
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,934
<font color="yellow">So, I won't do a thing to you.</font>

226
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:46,565
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

227
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:50,717

it's all because of your actions.</font>

<font color="yellow">We lost her.</font>

299
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:10,835
<font color="yellow">The evidence is either
with her or Choi Joon Gu.</font>

300
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:14,357
<font color="yellow">Are you positive this
evidence even exists?</font>

301
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:18,415
<font color="yellow">Seeing as how Choi Joon Gu and that
detective both came to that place...</font>

302
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,201
<font color="yellow">I am sure of it.</font>

303
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:24,301
<font color="yellow">Watch over the broadcast team
to see if they get their hands on it.</font>

304
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,897
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you have to do
to stop that show.</font>

305
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:28,677
<font color="yellow">Even if we must discard UCN.</font>

306
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:30,117
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

307
00:23:35,118 --> 00:23:36,921
<font color="yellow">I'm Reporter Jang Jin Woong,
I called you.</font>

308
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,073
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Sorry for being late.</font>

309
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,973
<font color="yellow">I'm going to start with
some basic questions.</font>

310
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,319
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago...</font>

311
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,175
<font color="yellow">you suddenly quit your job as
Ham Tae Seob's driver.</font>

312
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:55,033
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Why did you quit?</font>

313
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,193
<font color="yellow">I hear it's a great job.</font>

314
00:23:57,193 --> 00:24:00,927
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob is known for
being good to his employees.</font>

315
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,746
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me to talk to you about it.</font>

316
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:07,751
<font color="yellow">I signed a confidentiality agreement.</font>

317
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:10,739
<font color="yellow">Even though I no longer work there,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.</font>

318
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,421
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you being that way?</font>

319
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,732
<font color="yellow">You came to meet me, didn't you?
So why be like this?</font>

320
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,837
<font color="yellow">Do you want something from me?</font>

321
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,392
<font color="yellow">Should I give you something
in return for the interview?</font>

322
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,087
<font color="yellow">I think I made a mistake.</font>

323
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,496
<font color="yellow">You gave up and left seven years ago.</font>

324
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:27,692
<font color="yellow">Then something happened back then.</font>

325
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:30,751
<font color="yellow">You saw something, right?</font>

326
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:40,363
<font color="yellow">Hi! You must be Hyun Woo.</font>

327
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,036
<font color="yellow">Do you want to talk to me?</font>

328
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:44,540
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

329
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:50,907
<font color="yellow">Let me interview Hyun Woo about
what happened during that week.</font>

330
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,770
<font color="yellow">He's the only one who knows what
went on with the kidnappers.</font>

331
00:24:57,901 --> 00:24:58,991
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

332
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:02,677
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking to do it for nothing.</font>

333
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,336
<font color="yellow">Is Ham Tae Seob coming on the show?</font>

334
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,847
<font color="yellow">You just revealed that preview,
so now what are you going to do?</font>

335
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:14,457
<font color="yellow">Aren't you bringing him on the show
hoping to get more solid evidence?</font>

336
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:17,180
<font color="yellow">I don't need your help so get lost.</font>

337
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,649
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

338
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,488
<font color="yellow">I'll leave.</font>

339
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:24,538
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should tell SG first then.</font>

340
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,312
<font color="yellow">Don't ever mess with Hyun Woo.</font>

341
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:34,177
<font color="yellow">One hour once this show is over.
An exclusive interview.</font>

342
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:40,312
<font color="yellow">What I have is...</font>

343
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:48,577
<font color="yellow"><i>Dong Wook.</i></font>

344
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:59,184
<font color="yellow">You know the reports that
Doctor Kim Bong Joon made?</font>

345
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,675
<font color="yellow">There's a person who has them.</font>

346
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:04,967
<font color="yellow">She's a woman named Lee Jung Hee.
She's a victims family member.</font>

347
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:08,710
<font color="yellow">She got stabbed by people from SG.</font>

348
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:12,215
<font color="yellow"><i>I dropped her off at Jinsung Hospital.
Get over here now.</i></font>

349
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:17,257
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon, I think I can get evidence.</font>

350
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:19,376
<font color="yellow">There's a witness at
Jinsung Hospital's ER.</font>

351
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,604
<font color="yellow">Call the police.</font>

352
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,809
<font color="yellow">Tell them she was passed out
by the ER with a stab wound.</font>

353
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:29,306
<font color="yellow">It could create problems
for us if we don't report it.</font>

354
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:30,711
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

355
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,317
<font color="yellow"><i>Squad Car 390. Get to the hospital. </i></font>

356
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,281
<font color="yellow"><i>We'll be right there.</i></font>

357
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:50,416
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lieutenant Choi.</font>

358
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:53,942
<font color="yellow">We've found Lee Jung Hee.</font>

359
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,655
<font color="yellow">She was admitted to the ER
at Jinsung Hospital.</font>

360
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,944
<font color="yellow">They called in a stab wound patient.</font>

361
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,306
<font color="yellow">The patrol unit are going there now.</font>

362
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,393
<font color="yellow">Take care of it properly.</font>

363
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:15,751
<font color="yellow">Lee Jung Hee.</font>

364
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:19,057
<font color="yellow">I know Executive Director Choi.</font>

365
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:22,063
<font color="yellow">- The evidence from Kim Bong Joon...
- Are you her guardian?</font>

366
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:24,792
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

367
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,453
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship to her?</font>

368
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:27,633
<font color="yellow">I'm her friend.</font>

369
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,212
<font color="yellow">We got a call about a victim of a crime.</font>

370
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,614
<font color="yellow">We have a few questions to ask.</font>

371
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,542
<font color="yellow">Can you give us some time alone with her?</font>

372
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:38,533
<font color="yellow">Why don't you let her get treated first
and then ask your questions?</font>

373
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,289
<font color="yellow">There are procedures to follow.</font>

374
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,116
<font color="yellow">Don't get in the way of our jobs.</font>

375
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,009
<font color="yellow">And which procedures would
you be speaking of?</font>

376
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:52,082
<font color="yellow">What brings you here, Lieutenant Choi?</font>

377
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:54,896
<font color="yellow">This is an investigation
for a local police unit.</font>

378
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:57,273
<font color="yellow">What is Violent Crimes Unit doing here?</font>

379
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:00,524
<font color="yellow">Someone called in a favor.</font>

380
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:06,396
<font color="yellow">Hey! Put the camera down.</font>

381
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,049
<font color="yellow">It seems like some important
things might be said.</font>

382
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:14,938
<font color="yellow">Cha Seung In, what are you doing here?</font>

383
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,556
<font color="yellow">She's an important witness
in one of my cases.</font>

384
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,954
<font color="yellow">I'll handle the investigation,
so you can leave.</font>

385
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:23,760
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't fight against
just anyone like that.</font>

386
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,694
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it. We'll handle it.</font>

387
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:28,201
<font color="yellow">Why don't you two stay out of it?</font>

388
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:29,858
<font color="yellow">What!</font>

389
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,484
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to treat you differently
because you're my seniors.</font>

390
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:38,079
<font color="yellow">I'll put in an investigation request to
find out how you ended up on this case.</font>

391
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:41,671
<font color="yellow">Unless you think SG will have
your backs on that...</font>

392
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,246
<font color="yellow">you should back off now.</font>

393
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,686
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop filming!</font>

394
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,601
<font color="yellow">How did you know to come here?</font>

395
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:03,736
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon called me.</font>

396
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,175
<font color="yellow">You know when Ham Tae Seob
took you and spoke to you?</font>

397
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:24,876
<font color="yellow">Tell me everything in great detail.</font>

398
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:26,286
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do that?</font>

399
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:28,743
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

400
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:34,235
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kim Bong Joon is an expert in
disease control and epidemiology.</font>

401
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:39,984
<font color="yellow">While working in disease control,
he consulted Ha Dong Min for help.</font>

402
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:43,518
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min denied the truth and said the
cause of death was something else.</font>

403
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:46,418
<font color="yellow">He is pretty amazing.</font>

404
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,124
<font color="yellow">He was alone and on the run from SG.</font>

405
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,595
<font color="yellow">Yet, he was working with researchers
from foreign countries.</font>

406
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:54,722
<font color="yellow">And he was running tests on his own.</font>

407
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:59,115
<font color="yellow">It refutes Professor Kim Woo Jin's paper.</font>

408
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:03,675
<font color="yellow">Isn't this enough to make
SG admit the truth?</font>

409
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:05,221
<font color="yellow">SG won't admit it.</font>

410
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,828
<font color="yellow">They will do whatever they can
to get out of it.</font>

411
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:10,389
<font color="yellow">Still, we can use this to fight back.</font>

412
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,496
<font color="yellow">I want you to use this
to write your script.</font>

413
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:17,799
<font color="yellow">Since he can't be a witness,
stay on point but give out information.</font>

414
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:19,457
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

415
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:41,437
<font color="yellow">We wondered if we could help,
so we came here.</font>

416
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:47,940
<font color="yellow">So, you've been sick for over two years.</font>

417
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,950
<font color="yellow">You never knew why?</font>

418
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,265
<font color="yellow">That's right. I had no idea.</font>

419
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:57,376
<font color="yellow">The insurance company said they
would come and look into it.</font>

420
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,606
<font color="yellow">I left it to them.</font>

421
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,336
<font color="yellow">They only came up with a few
possibilities for what it could be.</font>

422
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:07,205
<font color="yellow">I only found out
after I saw this TV show.</font>

423
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:14,983
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask all of you.</font>

424
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:19,168
<font color="yellow">Something besides the interview?</font>

425
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,975
<font color="yellow">Yes, if you agree to it.</font>

426
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:39,934
<font color="yellow">Let's get a divorce.</font>

427
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,408
<font color="yellow">We should have done it a long time ago.</font>

428
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,659
<font color="yellow">I haven't done anything right either.</font>

429
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,569
<font color="yellow">All I have done is use you, Jung Ho.</font>

430
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,619
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

431
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:00,020
<font color="yellow">But, what?</font>

432
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:05,001
<font color="yellow">For one last time,
let's use each other.</font>

433
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,673
<font color="yellow">Help me with today's show.</font>

434
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,450
<font color="yellow">You know Ham Tae Seob's weakness.</font>

435
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:14,771
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

436
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,550
<font color="yellow">What can you give me?</font>

437
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,801
<font color="yellow">This station is about to
be destroyed because of you.</font>

438
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,140
<font color="yellow">All of my UCN stock.</font>

439
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:29,992
<font color="yellow">I'll give you all of them.</font>

440
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,861
<font color="yellow">Are you confident you'll win?</font>

441
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,271
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

442
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,701
<font color="yellow">If you've picked a fight,
make sure to destroy them completely.</font>

443
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:45,781
<font color="yellow">Don't do a half-hearted job and
make me suffer too.</font>

444
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,644
<font color="yellow">I'll give it a try.</font>

445
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:52,629
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

446
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:58,159
<font color="yellow">This is the best ending we can have.</font>

447
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,364
<font color="yellow">Our show will be starting soon.</font>

448
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:12,489
<font color="yellow">We all started it for a different reason.</font>

449
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:16,526
<font color="yellow">And we're all doing this last tenth
episode for different reasons too.</font>

450
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,021
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

451
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:25,403
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever I need in order
to find Hyun Woo.</font>

452
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:29,827
<font color="yellow">Whatever your reason is,
just make this show happen.</font>

453
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,530
<font color="yellow">I'm curious.</font>

454
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:34,431
<font color="yellow">Is a TV show like this really possible?</font>

455
00:33:38,132 --> 00:33:42,694
<font color="yellow">This show pays a lot of money
and I really need that money.</font>

456
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,019
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will be very responsible.</font>

457
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:50,558
<font color="yellow">I will work very hard so that
we find Hyun Woo for sure!</font>

458
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:56,071
<font color="yellow">The reason I want to do
this episode is still the same.</font>

459
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:01,596
<font color="yellow">How will this show influence people,
and how far can we go?</font>

460
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,191
<font color="yellow">I still want to test that.</font>

461
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:05,984
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

462
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,642
<font color="yellow">Now that we've found Hyun Woo...</font>

463
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:11,077
<font color="yellow">we have one thing left with this show.</font>

464
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,406
<font color="yellow">The people who've lost
their family so painfully.</font>

465
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:19,921
<font color="yellow">They went so far as to kidnap and murder
in order to tell people the truth.</font>

466
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,961
<font color="yellow">People died because of
an air purifier humidifier.</font>

467
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:30,401
<font color="yellow">Some people are sick and dying without
even knowing the reason why.</font>

468
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,146
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob needs to come on the show.</font>

469
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:39,736
<font color="yellow">Once we do the show the way we want,
how will people react?</font>

470
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,818
<font color="yellow">How much strength can a TV show have?</font>

471
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,131
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about that.</font>

472
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,097
<font color="yellow">Will we each get what
we want out of this?</font>

473
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:55,475
<font color="yellow">Let's all do our very best.</font>

474
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,372
<font color="yellow">Because, it is our last episode.</font>

475
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,823
<font color="yellow">I'll forgive you if you read this to me.</font>

476
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:21,073
<font color="yellow">- This part.
- Again?</font>

477
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:24,714
<font color="yellow">How many times is it now?
You must've memorized it by now.</font>

478
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:30,283
<font color="yellow">"Edmund walked by his side
and said to Peter."</font>

479
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,678
<font color="yellow"><i>"Everything will be okay."</i></font>

480
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,794
<font color="yellow"><i>"Peter, we'll be able to knock
Miraz down in one blow, right?"</i></font>

481
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,843
<font color="yellow"><i>"Peter replied to him calmly."</i></font>

482
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:43,430
<font color="yellow"><i>"I'm fighting in order to find that out."</i></font>

483
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:53,566
<font color="yellow">You just need to wait a little longer.
Are you okay?</font>

484
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:56,249
<font color="yellow">You've waited a long time, right?</font>

485
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:01,559
<font color="yellow">Wait just a little longer.</font>

486
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:09,508
<font color="yellow">Right now...</font>

487
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:13,548
<font color="yellow">they're looking through the house
where Choi Joon Gu lived with his wife.</font>

488
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,024
<font color="yellow">Also, his mother-in-law's home
and the charnel house.</font>

489
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,383
<font color="yellow">It's these three places.</font>

490
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:22,187
<font color="yellow">It could be one those three places.</font>

491
00:36:23,763 --> 00:36:25,537
<font color="yellow">Still, I want you to look around.</font>

492
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,272
<font color="yellow">- Yes, okay.
- Okay.</font>

493
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:34,642
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

494
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:42,106
<font color="yellow">We have been doing this show at the
request of the kidnapper who took my son.</font>

495
00:36:43,296 --> 00:36:48,374
<font color="yellow">However, we plan on revealing
a shocking truth to the viewers today.</font>

496
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,158
<font color="yellow">That is why we are doing this show today.</font>

497
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:54,606
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</font>

498
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:06,591
<font color="yellow">Yesterday night...</font>

499
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,173
<font color="yellow">I finally...</font>

500
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,656
<font color="yellow">found my son, Hyun Woo.</font>

501
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,640
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob will be going on soon.</font>

502
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,238
<font color="yellow">Guests will be going in and out quickly,
so be on your toes.</font>

503
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lieutenant Oh. It's starting.
Please come on in.</font>

504
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,305
<font color="yellow">We played an audio file for you
as our preview.</font>

505
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:27,066
<font color="yellow">It is a conversation that my late husband
Ham Tae Young had with Ham Tae Seob.</font>

506
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:29,872
<font color="yellow">After the preview was released</font>

507
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:35,656
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob let us know that he
wanted to explain the situation himself.</font>

508
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:56,464
<font color="yellow">How could he do that?</font>

509
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,669
<font color="yellow">He's putting on a show.</font>

510
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,088
<font color="yellow">After making us this way?</font>

511
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:06,122
<font color="yellow">First, regarding Song Hyun Woo...</font>

512
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:10,305
<font color="yellow">No, I mean Ham Hyun Woo
and the issue of the birth father</font>

513
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:16,111
<font color="yellow">I apologize to everyone for
the inconvenience it has caused.</font>

514
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:25,301
<font color="yellow"><i>At SG, we used all means possible
and wanted to find out the truth.</i></font>

515
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:30,899
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, don't try to get the truth
or refute anything he says.</font>

516
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:34,245
<font color="yellow">We're going create a situation
that Ham Tae Seob can control.</font>

517
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:38,660
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I will take measures so
that my honor is not destroyed.</font>

518
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:41,560
<font color="yellow">We have heard Ham Tae Seob's
side of the story.</font>

519
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:46,584
<font color="yellow">Regarding the accusation of conspiring
to murder Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young</font>

520
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:49,591
<font color="yellow">I take that to mean you deny it.</font>

521
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,597
<font color="yellow">We have a witness in
the studio to testify</font>

522
00:39:55,597 --> 00:39:58,814
<font color="yellow">she was kidnapped by Ham Tae Seob.</font>

523
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:10,568
<font color="yellow">What are you...</font>

524
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:28,952
<font color="yellow">He seemed to have a fear of germs.</font>

525
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,327
<font color="yellow">Replay that scene
of Ham Tae Seob's reaction.</font>

526
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,653
<font color="yellow">Viewers know he's pretending to
be weak because of the audio preview.</font>

527
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,321
<font color="yellow">But, it's still fun for them to see it.</font>

528
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:51,908
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

529
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:55,714
<font color="yellow">Only question Lee Ji Eun.</font>

530
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,423
<font color="yellow">She has to cut him off</font>

531
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,803
<font color="yellow">before he counterattacks with
the accusation that we saved Lee Ji Eun.</font>

532
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:03,732
<font color="yellow">If he realizes that we're running
the show, he'll squirm in his seat.</font>

533
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:04,906
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

534
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:06,772
<font color="yellow">Only question Lee Ji Eun.</font>

535
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,622
<font color="yellow">Only question Lee Ji Eun.</font>

536
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,814
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun.</font>

537
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:19,263
<font color="yellow">Two nights ago...</font>

538
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:25,513
<font color="yellow">you were attacked by some men
and locked in a basement?</font>

539
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:27,555
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

540
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:34,118
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with me?</font>

541
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,343
<font color="yellow">The next morning...</font>

542
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:41,537
<font color="yellow">a man came into the basement and
demanded to know where Hyun Woo was.</font>

543
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:45,127
<font color="yellow">I didn't answer him and he ordered
the other men to beat me.</font>

544
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:49,015
<font color="yellow">Is it this man sitting here?</font>

545
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:51,767
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

546
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:56,939
<font color="yellow">Are you willing to testify that
in a court or to the police?</font>

547
00:41:57,597 --> 00:41:58,667
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

548
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:06,410
<font color="yellow"><i>This show has not changed at all.</i></font>

549
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:10,676
<font color="yellow">You said a shocking truth
would be revealed.</font>

550
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,367
<font color="yellow">You have not confirmed facts
and there is no evidence.</font>

551
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:16,857
<font color="yellow">You come to conclusions using
the claims of a criminal.</font>

552
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:27,004
<font color="yellow">Your evidence has arrived!</font>

553
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:32,673
<font color="yellow">I thought I should keep my
mouth shut forever and live.</font>

554
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:35,551
<font color="yellow">I saw the show yesterday.</font>

555
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,383
<font color="yellow">Then I was watching my daughter sleep.</font>

556
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:41,591
<font color="yellow">I thought this isn't right.</font>

557
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:43,992
<font color="yellow">Use it for something good.</font>

558
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:57,383
<font color="yellow">I did something good, huh?</font>

559
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,631
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

560
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:02,834
<font color="yellow">Ask.</font>

561
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:07,133
<font color="yellow">This would be a huge exclusive article
if you wrote it and put it up.</font>

562
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,713
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring it to me?</font>

563
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,760
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you still don't know me.</font>

564
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:17,089
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

565
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:23,805
<font color="yellow">That's Executive Director Choi's chapter.</font>

566
00:43:23,805 --> 00:43:26,502
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get an exclusive
and write it.</font>

567
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,691
<font color="yellow">Check the very back. Look.</font>

568
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,769
<font color="yellow">You see my chapter, right?</font>

569
00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:37,629
<font color="yellow">The critical piece of evidence I bring,
how will it affect the show?</font>

570
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,890
<font color="yellow">How will it help catch Ham Tae Seob?</font>

571
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:44,013
<font color="yellow">That is the highlight of this book!</font>

572
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,490
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is currently under arrest.</font>

573
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:02,388
<font color="yellow">The police will do a thorough
investigation of Lee Ji Eun's crimes.</font>

574
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:05,035
<font color="yellow">At the same time...</font>

575
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,810
<font color="yellow">we will also start an investigation
in the kidnapping</font>

576
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,339
<font color="yellow">and confinement of Lee Ji Eun.</font>

577
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:16,377
<font color="yellow">Once the investigation starts
and we have the results</font>

578
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:20,339
<font color="yellow">we will make an announcement as well.</font>

579
00:44:27,914 --> 00:44:31,763
<font color="yellow">I will pay for the crimes
I have committed.</font>

580
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:35,694
<font color="yellow">I'll be atoning for it my whole life.</font>

581
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:41,147
<font color="yellow">That, alone, makes me
a better person than you.</font>

582
00:45:13,772 --> 00:45:15,044
<font color="yellow">Turn on the video.</font>

583
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:30,231
<font color="yellow">Why did you change your mind?</font>

584
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:33,649
<font color="yellow">You told Director Choi that
you wouldn't be doing it.</font>

585
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:38,464
<font color="yellow">If I don't do it, no one will.</font>

586
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:41,524
<font color="yellow">My company will never admit to it.</font>

587
00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:44,714
<font color="yellow">It will turn into a long fight.</font>

588
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:48,280
<font color="yellow">The victims will just keep getting hurt.</font>

589
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:51,774
<font color="yellow">What about your wife and baby?</font>

590
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:20,258
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob is shaken up right now.</font>

591
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,251
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, listen to me
and don't think about anything.</font>

592
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:28,341
<font color="yellow">We've informed everyone about
everything to do with this now.</font>

593
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:30,341
<font color="yellow">We've exposed who Ham Tae Seob is too.</font>

594
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:33,232
<font color="yellow">That's what it's been about so far.</font>

595
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,281
<font color="yellow">Don't forget the goal of this show.</font>

596
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:40,220
<font color="yellow">It's important to make Ham Tae Seob
admit it in front of the viewers.</font>

597
00:46:41,122 --> 00:46:45,310
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to make him admit
he was covering up the humidifier issue.</font>

598
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:48,122
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob.</font>

599
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,810
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago, Ham Tae Young
wanted to expose the truth.</font>

600
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,142
<font color="yellow">You wanted to cover up the truth
about the issue with the humidifiers.</font>

601
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,122
<font color="yellow">Did you hire people to kill
Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun?</font>

602
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,338
<font color="yellow">No, I did not.</font>

603
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:08,133
<font color="yellow">You only have speculation
and no evidence.</font>

604
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:11,961
<font color="yellow">How can you even prove that the voices
in that video are their voices?</font>

605
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:19,289
<font color="yellow"><i>People like us get two
or three levels of insurance.</i></font>

606
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,356
<font color="yellow"><i>For example, something like this.</i></font>

607
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:31,752
<font color="yellow"><i>President Ham Tae Seob.
We know you're our client.</i></font>

608
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:35,767
<font color="yellow"><i>It's not going to work for us if you
stay hidden while we do dangerous work.</i></font>

609
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:38,812
<font color="yellow"><i>You only let us talk to your employees.</i></font>

610
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,169
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought I'd give you a report of
what happened myself.</i></font>

611
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:42,819
<font color="yellow"><i>Get to the point.</i></font>

612
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:45,430
<font color="yellow"><i>I took care of Na Jae Hyun.</i></font>

613
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,917
<font color="yellow"><i>I was only going to scare
Ham Tae Young like you said.</i></font>

614
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:50,618
<font color="yellow"><i>He ran in there to save Na Jae Hyun.</i></font>

615
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,214
<font color="yellow"><i>I had no choice.</i></font>

616
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:54,138
<font color="yellow"><i>He saw our faces too.</i></font>

617
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:57,738
<font color="yellow"><i>Too bad. Look here, Ham Tae Seob.</i></font>

618
00:47:58,151 --> 00:47:59,281
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you listening?</i></font>

619
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:02,937
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll send someone.
Make it look like an accident.</i></font>

620
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:05,952
<font color="yellow"><i>And don't ever call here again.</i></font>

621
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:10,609
<font color="yellow">This is like a noose you can use
to get Ham Tae Seob.</font>

622
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:13,919
<font color="yellow">How much will you give me for it?</font>

623
00:48:14,997 --> 00:48:16,678
<font color="yellow">What will you do if I call the police?</font>

624
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:20,888
<font color="yellow">You think I can't get out of that after
being in this line of work this long?</font>

625
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,348
<font color="yellow">I hear you collect weaknesses
of people in high places.</font>

626
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:31,591
<font color="yellow">You know Ham Tae Seob's weakness.</font>

627
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:33,749
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

628
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:04,354
<font color="yellow">Stop this show right now if
you don't want to get fired.</font>

629
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:08,064
<font color="yellow">No matter how much I think about it,
I have nothing to replace this show.</font>

630
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:14,314
<font color="yellow">If there's a show with ratings this high,
I'll put that on.</font>

631
00:49:16,356 --> 00:49:17,484
<font color="yellow">Take a look.</font>

632
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,553
<font color="yellow">I think it's going to
get really good now.</font>

633
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:27,441
<font color="yellow">The audio file you just heard was of
Ham Tae Seob and Jo Nam Chul.</font>

634
00:49:28,372 --> 00:49:33,414
<font color="yellow">This evidence, alone, is enough for
Ham Tae Seob to get arrested.</font>

635
00:49:33,923 --> 00:49:36,075
<font color="yellow">Before we do that...</font>

636
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:39,575
<font color="yellow">he went so far as to hire killers
in order to cover this up.</font>

637
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:42,682
<font color="yellow">The issue of SG Chemical's
air purifier humidifiers.</font>

638
00:49:43,602 --> 00:49:46,171
<font color="yellow">We will bring out his victims.</font>

639
00:49:46,923 --> 00:49:49,593
<font color="yellow">And give him an opportunity to admit
he was wrong and apologize.</font>

640
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:53,323
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm bringing them in.</i></font>

641
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:56,133
<font color="yellow"><i>You can all come in now.</i></font>

642
00:50:08,053 --> 00:50:10,406
<font color="yellow">Family members can come in too.</font>

643
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:25,776
<font color="yellow">Here in the studio, we have people
who have used the SG humidifier.</font>

644
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:28,102
<font color="yellow">These victims are suffering
from a lung disease.</font>

645
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,917
<font color="yellow">Also, their families have
joined them here today.</font>

646
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:34,972
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob.</font>

647
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:41,242
<font color="yellow">Will you sincerely apologize to
these people in front of you?</font>

648
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,283
<font color="yellow">You have gone out of your way...</font>

649
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:59,758
<font color="yellow">to fabricate this evidence against me.</font>

650
00:51:00,713 --> 00:51:03,412
<font color="yellow">You are lying to the viewers.</font>

651
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,982
<font color="yellow">You attack the integrity of SG Group.</font>

652
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:09,443
<font color="yellow">You defame my name and honor.
For what reason?</font>

653
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,160
<font color="yellow">I really do not know why.</font>

654
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:15,792
<font color="yellow">Are you even a human being!</font>

655
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,343
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is that?</font>

656
00:51:17,343 --> 00:51:19,919
<font color="yellow">- How could you...
- You're not human.</font>

657
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,868
<font color="yellow">You should be apologizing!</font>

658
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:24,591
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

659
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,459
<font color="yellow">You call yourself a human being?</font>

660
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:31,301
<font color="yellow">Choi Joon Gu must be
watching this right now.</font>

661
00:51:32,278 --> 00:51:34,280
<font color="yellow">We have to catch him before this ends.</font>

662
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,294
<font color="yellow">Once this show ends</font>

663
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,729
<font color="yellow">he'll think it's all over
and kill himself.</font>

664
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:43,919
<font color="yellow">Where do you think he is?</font>

665
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,140
<font color="yellow">They're all at the places he could be at.</font>

666
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,968
<font color="yellow">If it were me...</font>

667
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:52,839
<font color="yellow">I would want to be here.</font>

668
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:57,089
<font color="yellow">The broadcast team is doing the show
that he originally wanted to do.</font>

669
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:05,428
<font color="yellow">You should go to the studio.</font>

670
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:09,017
<font color="yellow">Senior, you should do it.</font>

671
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:10,582
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Go.</font>

672
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:04,336
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi!</font>

673
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:12,952
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha.</font>

674
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:17,202
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi, don't do that.
Come down from there.</font>

675
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,412
<font color="yellow">In the end, this is how it turned out.</font>

676
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:30,149
<font color="yellow">Nothing worked, no matter what I did.</font>

677
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:34,261
<font color="yellow">I killed all those people.</font>

678
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:36,941
<font color="yellow">I did things to people I shouldn't have.</font>

679
00:53:37,742 --> 00:53:42,122
<font color="yellow">I did an awful thing to a little child.</font>

680
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,162
<font color="yellow">Executive Director Choi,
come down and talk.</font>

681
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:50,361
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

682
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,977
<font color="yellow">I was planning to go
once I finished everything.</font>

683
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,368
<font color="yellow">To my baby...</font>

684
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,709
<font color="yellow">and to where my wife is buried.</font>

685
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:06,986
<font color="yellow">If I knew I wouldn't be seeing them,
I should've visited earlier.</font>

686
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:11,151
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to say to them
now if I meet them later?</font>

687
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,466
<font color="yellow">I left them there, all lonely.</font>

688
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:19,615
<font color="yellow">You should go. You can even go now.</font>

689
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:21,343
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but...</font>

690
00:54:22,854 --> 00:54:26,352
<font color="yellow">I'll go to hell and pay for my crimes.</font>

691
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:42,566
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob.</font>

692
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,863
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for conspiracy to
murder Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young.</font>

693
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:50,039
<font color="yellow">You have the to remain silent
and a right to an attorney.</font>

694
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,772
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your face?
You're just a young man.</font>

695
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:59,952
<font color="yellow">You're arresting me in
front of the entire country.</font>

696
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,975
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can handle it once
the investigation results come out?</font>

697
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,819
<font color="yellow">How can someone be so brazen?</font>

698
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:11,580
<font color="yellow">He needs to go to prison
to get his head on straight!</font>

699
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,111
<font color="yellow">What kind of a person behaves that way?</font>

700
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,535
<font color="yellow">Rot in prison.</font>

701
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:29,415
<font color="yellow">Stay in prison forever!</font>

702
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:42,117
<font color="yellow">For a long time,
I wondered why my son was kidnapped.</font>

703
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:47,117
<font color="yellow">Why was it me chosen to do this show?</font>

704
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:48,977
<font color="yellow">He did not let me know.</font>

705
00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:55,095
<font color="yellow">He never gave a mission
to reveal my own crimes.</font>

706
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:57,258
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

707
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:03,126
<font color="yellow">I had definitely done something wrong.</font>

708
00:56:04,537 --> 00:56:07,200
<font color="yellow">Back when it happened seven years ago</font>

709
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:10,794
<font color="yellow">my husband did not tell me the specifics.</font>

710
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:16,300
<font color="yellow">I knew that SG Chemical
had done something wrong.</font>

711
00:56:16,301 --> 00:56:19,680
<font color="yellow">And that people were
getting hurt or dying.</font>

712
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,810
<font color="yellow">I also knew that SG
was trying to cover it up.</font>

713
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:29,486
<font color="yellow">But, I was more concerned about
my husband getting hurt.</font>

714
00:56:30,756 --> 00:56:32,513
<font color="yellow">I thought of myself and my baby.</font>

715
00:56:33,925 --> 00:56:36,441
<font color="yellow">I worried my family would be in danger.</font>

716
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:41,785
<font color="yellow">So, I objected to my husband
taking part in this work.</font>

717
00:56:45,046 --> 00:56:47,376
<font color="yellow">I told him to choose
between doing it or me.</font>

718
00:56:48,386 --> 00:56:50,756
<font color="yellow">I pushed him to leave for France with me.</font>

719
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:58,176
<font color="yellow">My husband was going to
give up on it because of me.</font>

720
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:04,588
<font color="yellow">That was my crime.</font>

721
00:57:09,865 --> 00:57:11,584
<font color="yellow">I want to use this opportunity...</font>

722
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,372
<font color="yellow">to apologize to all of you.</font>

723
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,675
<font color="yellow">I only thought of my baby
and family as precious.</font>

724
00:57:28,557 --> 00:57:30,352
<font color="yellow">In order to protect that</font>

725
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:34,783
<font color="yellow">I thought it was okay to turn my back
on the pains of others.</font>

726
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:39,575
<font color="yellow">I did not even try to know
about people who were in pain.</font>

727
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:42,783
<font color="yellow">You were wronged.</font>

728
00:57:44,472 --> 00:57:46,544
<font color="yellow">And you were in severe situations.</font>

729
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:50,300
<font color="yellow">For that, I am so sorry.</font>

730
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:54,707
<font color="yellow">I am very sorry.</font>

731
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:43,691
<font color="yellow">Don't die.</font>

732
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,082
<font color="yellow">Don't die.</font>

733
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,910
<font color="yellow">Don't run away.</font>

734
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:52,519
<font color="yellow">Just live.</font>

735
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,582
<font color="yellow">Don't go to hell.</font>

736
00:58:56,673 --> 00:58:58,468
<font color="yellow">Pay for what you've done here.</font>

737
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:04,240
<font color="yellow">It's not like nothing has changed.</font>

738
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,499
<font color="yellow">People know now.</font>

739
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:10,961
<font color="yellow">Stay alive, whether it's
in prison or wherever.</font>

740
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,091
<font color="yellow">Watch over SG Group to see
what they end up doing.</font>

741
00:59:16,408 --> 00:59:18,084
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes and watch them.</font>

742
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:25,921
<font color="yellow">Also, watch over those victims.</font>

743
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:29,281
<font color="yellow">Watch how they stand back up again.</font>

744
00:59:31,356 --> 00:59:35,158
<font color="yellow">Watch to see what choices people
unrelated to this end up making.</font>

745
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,943
<font color="yellow">You have to see it.</font>

746
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:47,430
<font color="yellow">And people like Senior Sang Shik...</font>

747
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:51,211
<font color="yellow">who sacrificed their lives to help you.</font>

748
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,370
<font color="yellow">And Na Soo Hyun, though he
went about it wrong...</font>

749
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,676
<font color="yellow">He wanted to see that end.
You have a responsibility to them.</font>

750
01:00:04,656 --> 01:00:06,124
<font color="yellow">You have to be here.</font>

751
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:36,073
<font color="yellow">At this point...</font>

752
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:41,475
<font color="yellow">we will tell you everything we know
about SG's air purifier humidifier.</font>

753
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:44,684
<font color="yellow">We will start from the beginning.</font>

754
01:00:54,743 --> 01:00:55,975
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

755
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,122
<font color="yellow">I feel strange.</font>

756
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:03,814
<font color="yellow">The perpetrator is being punished.</font>

757
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,180
<font color="yellow">The whole country knows now.</font>

758
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,510
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd feel good
once this happened.</font>

759
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:17,537
<font color="yellow">Do you think anything will change now?</font>

760
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:21,120
<font color="yellow">Will we get a proper apology?</font>

761
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:26,425
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Seob will probably escape
legal punishment somehow.</font>

762
01:01:29,379 --> 01:01:31,256
<font color="yellow">SG will not admit to any wrongdoing.</font>

763
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:34,803
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

764
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,167
<font color="yellow">we will keep doing what we can.</font>

765
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:42,769
<font color="yellow">What we must do.</font>

766
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,731
<font color="yellow">Even at this very moment</font>

767
01:01:56,992 --> 01:02:02,289
<font color="yellow">it could you or your loved ones
who are in pain without knowing why.</font>

768
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:06,790
<font color="yellow">I would estimate that there are
millions of these potential victims.</font>

769
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,472
<font color="yellow">It's finally the end.</font>

770
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:16,881
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to work with you again.</font>

771
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:19,419
<font color="yellow">You don't know what
I'm going to work on next.</font>

772
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:22,095
<font color="yellow">Whatever you do,
we don't suit each other.</font>

773
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:28,260
<font color="yellow">More than doing well,
I care about doing things right.</font>

774
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:31,019
<font color="yellow">I want to work with
you again, Writer Yeon.</font>

775
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:34,238
<font color="yellow">I want try something different now.</font>

776
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:36,758
<font color="yellow">You're not talking about...</font>

777
01:02:37,899 --> 01:02:41,861
<font color="yellow">Director, you're not really going to
do a new show on this, are you?</font>

778
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,408
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to work with me?</font>

779
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:52,439
<font color="yellow">I'll see how today's show goes first.</font>

780
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:04,934
<font color="yellow"><i>SG must be held responsible.</i></font>

781

the air purifier humidifier</i></font>

used the humidifiers for a long time.</i></font>

786
