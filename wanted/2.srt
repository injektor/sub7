83

84
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,050

95
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,550
<font color="yellow">I think it's about time you've
started preparing yourself</font>

96
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,650
<font color="yellow">to retire from being a Commissioner,
and become an Assemblyman.</font>

97

you trust and tell them to deposit it.</font>

101
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,150
<font color="yellow">I'll give you even more
money after that.</font>

102
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,350
<font color="yellow">This is something that you must do if you
are going to go and do great things.</font>

103
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,550

<font color="yellow">All right.
I'll call you again.</font>

107
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,150
<font color="yellow">Was this because of the issue
regarding your son?</font>

108
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,750
<font color="yellow">It's just that my plans
have been pulled forward a bit.</font>

109
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,150
<font color="yellow">This is something that I've been

110
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,340
<font color="yellow">What do you need?</font>

111
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,650
<font color="yellow">Just 10 days.</font>

112
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,940
<font color="yellow">Make sure that the program
won't be negatively affected</font>

113
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,940
<font color="yellow">due to an investigation or
something, for ten days.</font>

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, Writer Yeon!
What brings you here?</font>

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,000
<font color="yellow">You must be happy, PD Jo.</font>

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
<font color="yellow">Your ratings were
already great, but, wow.</font>

117
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,050
<font color="yellow">How do you feel now,
now that they've skyrocketed?</font>

118
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,440
<font color="yellow">What are you
talking about?</font>

119
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,940
<font color="yellow">How could this possibly be a good thing?
A child was kidnapped!</font>

120
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,550
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
When Ms. Hye In collapsed... wow.</font>

121
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,050
<font color="yellow">Wow, you did a great job
evoking emotion.</font>

122
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,150
<font color="yellow">Seeing that, I...</font>

123
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,300
<font color="yellow">But seriously, what's going on?</font>

124
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,440
<font color="yellow">Is this why you suddenly quit?
For that show?</font>

125
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,800
<font color="yellow">You should've told me sooner!</font>

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,650
<font color="yellow">Then we would've
canceled Mr. Kim's appearance</font>

127
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,150
<font color="yellow">and would've made an episode
focusing solely on Jung Hye In!</font>

128
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,340
<font color="yellow">She went and did that on her own.
We didn't even knew she'd be doing that.</font>

129
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,340
<font color="yellow">How could such a spectacle happen
if everything had been pre-planned?</font>

130
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,750
<font color="yellow">But, um, is this
really happening?</font>

131
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,150
<font color="yellow">Poor Jung Hye In.</font>

132
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,340
<font color="yellow">Did anything strange come up</font>

133
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,840
<font color="yellow">or did a strange person
come by after the show?</font>

134
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

135
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,750
<font color="yellow">The criminal may contact you guys,
so please keep an ear to the ground.</font>

136
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,340
<font color="yellow">Don't try to profit off
this as an exclusive</font>

137
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,940
<font color="yellow">and let us know right away!</font>

138
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,750
<font color="yellow">Why would they contact us here?
Wouldn't they just contact Ms. Jung?</font>

139
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,440
<font color="yellow">And also, it's not like
that's up to me, you know.</font>

140
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,340
<font color="yellow">If the higher-ups tell me to reveal it,
I'll have no choice but to do it!</font>

141
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,440
<font color="yellow">You've already got yourself a cash cow,
so don't toy with a child's life, too.</font>

142
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,440
<font color="yellow">- I'll be going, then.
- Why, that little...</font>

143
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,650
<font color="yellow">Stop doing that.</font>

144
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,340
<font color="yellow">There are reporters outside.</font>

145
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,150
<font color="yellow">It wasn't bad. And it's not like I don't
understand how you must feel.</font>

146
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,550
<font color="yellow">But, you know, something about
this puts me in a bad mood.</font>

147
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,840
<font color="yellow">I don't want to put an end to everything
just because you did as you pleased.</font>

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,000
<font color="yellow">Did you speak to them?</font>

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't have
the time to do that yet.</font>

150
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,250
<font color="yellow">All you needed to do is
make a single phone call.</font>

151
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,250
<font color="yellow">At the very least, we need to
be filled in on what's going on.</font>

152
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,150
<font color="yellow">And what if you told me
that I couldn't do it?</font>

153
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,150
<font color="yellow">Then, you shouldn't
have done it.</font>

154
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,750
<font color="yellow">This is a program that I'm
risking my reputation on.</font>

155
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,150
<font color="yellow">You can't make any huge
decisions without my approval.</font>

156
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,550
<font color="yellow">If something like this
happens again, I'm out.</font>

157
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,650
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you
just one thing.</font>

158
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,250
<font color="yellow">Do you have any intention of wanting
to find Hyun Woo through this show?</font>

159
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,340
<font color="yellow">Of course we must find him.
And he must be safe.</font>

160
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,750
<font color="yellow">That's the only way this will
all end with a happy ending.</font>

161
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,840
<font color="yellow">That way, we can justify the premise
of the show, and it'll also become a hit.</font>

162
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you even curious about
how I feel toward all this?</font>

163
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,750
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is
find Hyun Woo, anyway.</font>

164
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,440
<font color="yellow">You're right.
That's true.</font>

165
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,750
<font color="yellow">- It's Ms. Jung Hye In!
- She's out!</font>

166
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,440
<font color="yellow">Take on the Jung Hye In case.</font>

167
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,840
<font color="yellow">And pass the Lee Ji Eun
incident over to Officer Shin.</font>

168
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,340
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

169
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,650
<font color="yellow">Can't you be good just once
and just do as I say?</font>

170
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,340
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to do that?</font>

171
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,840
<font color="yellow">Because you're
freakishly talented</font>

172
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,050
<font color="yellow">when it comes to kidnapping
and missing persons cases!</font>

173
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,250
<font color="yellow">And you have the highest
recovery rate of victims, too!</font>

174
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun is also a
victim of kidnapping.</font>

175
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,650
<font color="yellow">But the circumstances
are different, man!</font>

176
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,150
<font color="yellow">This is a case that was pretty much
announced to the entire country!</font>

177
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,150
<font color="yellow">So I'm sure that they'll
find the kid even faster.</font>

178
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,650
<font color="yellow">And since it's an incident
involving an influential figure</font>

179
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,940
<font color="yellow">the higher-ups will
do all they can, too.</font>

180
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,840
<font color="yellow">Use a unit of 10 or
20 people to find the kid.</font>

181
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,250
<font color="yellow">Just ignore the fact that I
exist until I find Lee Ji Eun.</font>

182
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,940
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at Mr. Hotshot over here,
picking and choosing what he takes on.</font>

183
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,440
<font color="yellow">Is that why your
record is so good?</font>

184
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,840
<font color="yellow">Find someone else for this case.
I don't want to work with him, either.</font>

185
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,340
<font color="yellow">Seeing how things have gotten this bad,
it's clear that I'm completely unskilled.</font>

186
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
<font color="yellow">Go, you sons of bitches!</font>

187
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,050
<font color="yellow">Do whatever the hell you want, and
don't even bother reporting back to me!</font>

188
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,840
<font color="yellow">Assholes.</font>

189
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,340
<font color="yellow">I'll go and wash up.</font>

190
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:06,840
<font color="yellow">Anyone who was watching Kiss and Talk,
a live talk show, must've been shocked.</font>

191
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,550
<font color="yellow">Actress Jung Hye In went on
the show as a surprise guest.</font>

192
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,940
<font color="yellow">However, she made the shocking
announcement that her son was kidnapped</font>

193
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,840
<font color="yellow">while live on the air, and has sent
shock waves throughout the nation.</font>

194
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,940
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jung stated the criminal ordered
her to create a live reality TV show</font>

195
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,750
<font color="yellow">in which she completes missions
sent to her by the captor.</font>

196
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,050
<font color="yellow">Currently, the police is conducting a
press conference regarding this case.</font>

197
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,650
<font color="yellow">Let's head over there now.</font>

198
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,150
<font color="yellow">Regarding "Wanted," the show that will
be airing on UCN on Saturday at 10 p.m.</font>

199
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,750
<font color="yellow">It is one way that we will be conducting
investigations regarding this case.</font>

200
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,190
<font color="yellow">We wish for the safe return
of Song Hyun Woo</font>

201
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,650
<font color="yellow">as much as his mother does</font>

202
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,150
<font color="yellow">and we have been forced
to make this decision.</font>

203
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,150
<font color="yellow">We will be making thorough preparations,
and treat this matter seriously.</font>

204
00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:00,050
<font color="yellow">We will also be working with the TV
team to do our best to find the child.</font>

205
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,550
<font color="yellow">I can only give you two weeks.
Find the kid before then.</font>

206
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,750
<font color="yellow">If this drags on any longer,
we're all dead. Got that?</font>

207
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand,
sir. Yes.</font>

208
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,840
<font color="yellow">Easier said than done,
man! Sheesh.</font>

209
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,440
<font color="yellow">We've already lost three days.
Get your heads on straight.</font>

210
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,250
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to
be working 24/7</font>

211
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,550
<font color="yellow">make sure you monitor all other media
outlets other than the show itself.</font>

212
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,750
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare sleep until we find
the kid, and eat while you're working!</font>

213
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,150
<font color="yellow">- Got that? Hurry and go!
- Yes, sir!</font>

214
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,340
<font color="yellow">There hasn't been any
word from the criminals.</font>

215
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,750
<font color="yellow">I thought we were supposed
to air the show tonight.</font>

216
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,050
<font color="yellow">That's why you should have just
reported this when it first happened!</font>

217
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,750
<font color="yellow">There's so much time you've lost by
fooling around and trusting the criminal!</font>

218
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,650
<font color="yellow">Sir, sir, sir! What good would
speculating about that do?</font>

219
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,340
<font color="yellow">Three days is long enough
for a child to have already died!</font>

220
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,150
<font color="yellow">Nothing good will come of
playing along with these mind games.</font>

221
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,750
<font color="yellow"><i>Mommy!</i></font>

222
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,340
<font color="yellow">Do all victims always come back alive
because the crime is reported to cops?</font>

223
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,550
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a child, Officer?
- I have a daughter.</font>

224
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,550
<font color="yellow">How do you think you would've
reacted if you were in my shoes?</font>

225
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,750
<font color="yellow">Well, um, yes. What's most important
right now is actually finding the child.</font>

226
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,340
<font color="yellow">Let's not cry over spilled
milk here, and...</font>

227
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,840
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone who would've had
any malicious intent toward you two?</font>

228
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,750
<font color="yellow">No. I can't think of
anyone like that.</font>

229
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,640
<font color="yellow">There's nobody that you've gotten
especially close to recently</font>

230
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,640
<font color="yellow">or had a falling-out with due
to work, all of the sudden?</font>

231
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,140
<font color="yellow">No, there isn't.</font>

232
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,140
<font color="yellow">There are some employees
who are suing his company.</font>

233
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,050
<font color="yellow">And those employees are
having their wages held, too.</font>

234
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,550
<font color="yellow">No, that's nothing major.</font>

235
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,750
<font color="yellow">All she's ever done is act,
so she knows nothing about business</font>

236
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,050
<font color="yellow">and she's making a
big deal over nothing.</font>

237
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,750
<font color="yellow">We'll be the judge of that.</font>

238
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,750
<font color="yellow">If you've gotten any threats,
please let us know about them.</font>

239
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,250
<font color="yellow">Even if it's nothing major,
you must tell us about it in detail.</font>

240
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,550
<font color="yellow">No, there haven't been
any instances like that.</font>

241
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,250
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of this, so you
head in and get some rest.</font>

242
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,450
<font color="yellow">You're quite sensitive right now.</font>

243
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,550
<font color="yellow">It's been all right for the past month
or so, but I have stalkers.</font>

244
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,640
<font color="yellow">There have also been times
where I've sued people for libel online.</font>

245
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,750
<font color="yellow">And there have been instances when this
man had been seeing some other women.</font>

246
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,750
<font color="yellow">I don't think their relationships
lasted very long, but you never know.</font>

247
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,340
<font color="yellow">Oh. How about we talk over there?</font>

248
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,140
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
We respect your privacy.</font>

249
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,750
<font color="yellow">We will ensure that details regarding the
case will not be leaked to the press.</font>

250
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,140
<font color="yellow">It's not like it'll be that big
of a deal even if it is leaked.</font>

251
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,140
<font color="yellow">I've been with her for a while,
so you know how it can be.</font>

252
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,450
<font color="yellow">The longer you stay with each other,
the larger your doubts grow.</font>

253
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,450
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I'll tell you
everything. Let us go.</font>

254
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,140
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your damn mind?</font>

255
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,550
<font color="yellow">Do you think I could honestly
be sane right now?</font>

256
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,950
<font color="yellow">Do you think that the
company will be okay</font>

257
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,450
<font color="yellow">after the police question the
people suing the company?</font>

258
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,140
<font color="yellow">I have no interest in your life.</font>

259
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,450
<font color="yellow">If you want to find Hyun Woo,
it'd be best if you were.</font>

260
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,050
<font color="yellow">If you'd just told me from the beginning,
things wouldn't have become like this.</font>

261
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,840
<font color="yellow">I have quite a bit of
influence, you see.</font>

262
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,140
<font color="yellow">Then do what you can now</font>

263
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,840
<font color="yellow">even though you're a bit
late to the game.</font>

264
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,750
<font color="yellow">No matter what anyone says, you've lived
as Hyun Woo's father for seven years.</font>

265
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,450
<font color="yellow">I'm back!</font>

266
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,450
<font color="yellow">- Jang Jin Woong!
- Yes?</font>

267
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,950
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

268
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,750
<font color="yellow">Damn it, why is she
targeting me?</font>

269
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,640
<font color="yellow">- Why are you lounging around here?
- Well, this is where I work.</font>

270
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
<font color="yellow">Where else should I be?</font>

271
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,450
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that we have an
urgent situation on our hands?</font>

272
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,750
<font color="yellow">Also, you're the one in
charge of Jung Hye In!</font>

273
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,950
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we leave kidnapping incidents
to be handled by the public?</font>

274
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,340
<font color="yellow">Why should the entertainment
section cover that?</font>

275
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,550
<font color="yellow">A top star's child has been abducted!
It's obviously a total exclusive!</font>

276
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,000
<font color="yellow">And you weren't at the meeting yesterday.</font>

277
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you so carefree lately?</font>

<font color="yellow">Is it this person,
by any chance?</font>

416
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,140
<font color="yellow">Oh... oh, yes! Yes!
Yes, it's him!</font>

417
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,050
<font color="yellow">He kept sending me
creepy videos and photos</font>

418
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,750
<font color="yellow">so I told him I'd report him to the
police, then he told me he loved me</font>

419
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,140
<font color="yellow">and even came to
my front door!</font>

420
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
<font color="yellow">So why didn't you report him?</font>

421
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,450
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. It's a
hassle to report people to the police.</font>

422
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,250
<font color="yellow">And most people back off once
you threaten to report them.</font>

423
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,750
<font color="yellow">I ran into him while I was
out with my boyfriend</font>

424
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,840
<font color="yellow">and he told me that he had a
business plan, or something.</font>

425
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,950
<font color="yellow">- It was kind of weird.
- A business plan?</font>

426
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,840
<font color="yellow">You know, kidnapping people
while they're broadcasting.</font>

427
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,950
<font color="yellow">He kept telling me that it would totally
blow up if he did something like that</font>

428
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,250
<font color="yellow">and that he had a plan.</font>

429
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,250
<font color="yellow">But I had no idea what
he was talking about.</font>

430
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,340
<font color="yellow">He got all worked up by himself.
Obviously, he was a psycho.</font>

431
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,950
<font color="yellow">- Anyway, can I head back in now?
- Oh, yes.</font>

432
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,450
<font color="yellow">If you remember
anything else, call me.</font>

433
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,140
<font color="yellow">- Thank you!
- Thank you!</font>

434
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,720
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

435
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
<font color="yellow">This is Cha Seung In of the
Gangnam Police Department.</font>

436
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,420
<font color="yellow">Oh, you confirmed it?
Yeah.</font>

437
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,520
<font color="yellow">Send the details to me over email.
I'll confirm it on the way there.</font>

438
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,320
<font color="yellow">Turn the car around.</font>

439
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,720
<font color="yellow">- Is it correct?
- We'll know when we get there.</font>

440
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,020
<font color="yellow">They've been in twice, but were
released due to lack of evidence.</font>

441
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,520
<font color="yellow">Go to Yeonnamdong.</font>

442
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,020
<font color="yellow">- Shouldn't we report this...
- We have to find the kid!</font>

443
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,620
<font color="yellow">We have no time!</font>

444
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,520
<font color="yellow">Let's arrest him first and
worry about a warrant later.</font>

445
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

446
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,020
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

447
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,320

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,720

- Who ordered you to do this?</font>

468
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,820
<font color="yellow">His name is Park Sae Yong.
I went to high school with them.</font>

469
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,020

478
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,520

what I was doing.</font>

479
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,920

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,120

489
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,920

That person doesn't live here!</font>

494

495
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720

<font color="yellow">- Sae Yong!
- Open the door!</font>

499
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,320
<font color="yellow">- No!
- Please, ma'am!</font>

500
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,720
<font color="yellow">Hey, untie him!</font>

501
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,620
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

502
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,020

Park Sae Yong!</font>

505

<font color="yellow">Yes, hello. We have someone who
attempted to commit suicide here!</font>

506
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,920

<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun isn't here.</font>

512
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,920
<font color="yellow">Seeing as he tried to commit suicide,
he may have already killed...</font>

513
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
<font color="yellow">Then go find the damn
corpse, bastard!</font>

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,420

First, send the photos to the police.</font>

517
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they'll be able
to find it quickly.</font>

518
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,720
<font color="yellow">Let's send the photos
to the breaking news team.</font>

519
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,620
<font color="yellow">We can use our network's
news channel, but not others'.</font>

520
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,320
<font color="yellow">This is ultimately a personal
matter, after all.</font>

521
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,520
<font color="yellow">It may be faster to do it
over social media.</font>

522
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,020
<font color="yellow">We can use Facebook,
Twitter, and Instagram.</font>

523
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
<font color="yellow">I've made accounts for
our show on all of those.</font>

524
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,820
<font color="yellow">Really? Then, I'll go and
meet with the police.</font>

525
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,920
<font color="yellow">It's crucial that we help them
with their investigation.</font>

526
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,720
<font color="yellow">Hye In. I got a call
from the police.</font>

527
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,020
<font color="yellow">You dropped your
phone before, so...</font>

528
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,730

<font color="yellow">You should've been with him!</font>

542
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,220
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You should've stayed with Hyun Woo!</font>

543
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,020
<font color="yellow">The person who took Hyun Woo
apparently committed suicide!</font>

544
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,620
<font color="yellow">If something happened to Hyun Woo,
I'll never forgive you.</font>

545
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,120
<font color="yellow">So you're basically asking the police
to help clean up after your mess?</font>

546
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,220
<font color="yellow">Is that what you're
saying right now?</font>

547
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,020
<font color="yellow">But even so, it's great that you kept
the motorcyclist from leaving, yes.</font>

548
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,220
<font color="yellow">Well, from now on, please call us
if anything like this happens again!</font>

549
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,320

<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

551
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,420

552
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,020

553
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,720
<font color="yellow">You did it in order to raise
the ratings of this show.</font>

554
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,020
<font color="yellow">Aren't you kind of hoping that
the criminal will not be caught?</font>

555
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,520
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?
- Mr. Choi Joon Gu.</font>

556
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,720

00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,120
<font color="yellow">Please wait at home, and I'll...</font>

698
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,320
<font color="yellow">I might get another
call from Hyun Woo.</font>

699
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,220
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

700
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,420
<font color="yellow">What are you
doing right now?</font>

701
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,820
<font color="yellow">Um, we're not completely
sure where it is, either.</font>

702
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,520
<font color="yellow">We're just going to
try heading out first</font>

703
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,120
<font color="yellow">so please give us a
call when you find the car.</font>

704
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,620
<font color="yellow">Tell me where the
hell you're going!</font>

705
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,520
<font color="yellow">But, um, why are you
talking so informally?</font>

706
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,620
<font color="yellow">It's pissing me off.</font>

707
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,520
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, you haven't
found where Hye In is yet?</font>

708
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,720
<font color="yellow">No. It keeps saying that she's
in the middle of another call.</font>

709
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,220
<font color="yellow">Call the authorities
and ask them to find her!</font>

710
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,820
<font color="yellow">I did, but they said that they can
only do that in emergency situations...</font>

711
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,320
<font color="yellow">Then put on an act, punk!</font>

712
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,970
<font color="yellow">Our program might go under
and a kid may die</font>

713
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,620
<font color="yellow">,
so what the hell are you doing?</font>

714
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,020
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

715
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,920
<font color="yellow">Who the hell are you?</font>

716
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,920
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey, you! Hey!</font>

717
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,020
<font color="yellow">He's not a staff member
of yours, right?</font>

718
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,320
<font color="yellow">Take it easy, please!
I'm not a weirdo, I promise!</font>

719
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,120
<font color="yellow">I'm a reporter!
Ow!</font>

720
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,720
<font color="yellow">I'm just here doing my job!</font>

721
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,220
<font color="yellow">Wait, sir! Ow!
Wait, please!</font>

722
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,020
<font color="yellow">Where did you say that you saw
those large pieces of cargo, again?</font>

723
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,720
<font color="yellow">- Here, here, and...
- Here it is.</font>

724
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,220
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

725
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,970
<font color="yellow">They said that the kid
might be in Incheon</font>

726
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,320
<font color="yellow">so check every nook and cranny!</font>

727
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,420
<font color="yellow">Did you find it? Hey, are you going to
take responsibility if the kid dies?</font>

728
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,420
<font color="yellow">I found it!
Sir, I found it!</font>

729
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,920
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll be right there.</font>

730
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,720
<font color="yellow">We found the place where
the call was made from.</font>

731
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,320
<font color="yellow">There are others looking
for him, too, so...</font>

732
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,020
<font color="yellow">Can we find him within
thirty minutes?</font>

733
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,720
<font color="yellow">- Yes, it's me.
- Where are you right now?</font>

734
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,460
<font color="yellow">What the hell are
you doing right now?</font>

735
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you find the car?</i></font>

736
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,220
<font color="yellow">Go to the studio right now.
We're on our way to the scene.</font>

737
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,820
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you heading?</i></font>

738
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,720
<font color="yellow">The north port in Incheon.
It's a warehouse.</font>

739
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,520
<font color="yellow">Is there a railroad
crossing near that?</font>

740
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,420
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

741
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,920
<font color="yellow">I got a call from Hyun Woo
and it's from the same location.</font>

742
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,220
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo and the criminal
may be near there, too.</font>

743
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,720
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

744
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,620
<font color="yellow">I'll do the show.
I'll be right there.</font>

745
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,720
<font color="yellow">I think I'll be there a bit after 10.
Text me your exact address.</font>

746
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Then, we'll use what Writer Yeon wrote...</i></font>

747
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,220
<font color="yellow"><i>No, I have to open the show.</i></font>

748
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,620
<font color="yellow">They'll have doubts
if we stall for time.</font>

749
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,520
<font color="yellow">You can broadcast a video that
I send you with my phone, right?</font>

750
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:11,320
<font color="yellow">Get ready to begin.
Five, four, three, two, one.</font>

751
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,220
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm all sweaty.</i></font>

752
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,320

BE INSIDE THIS TRUNK?]</i></font>

- Yes.</font>

755
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,420

in 10 seconds.</font>

756
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:29,920
<font color="yellow">Right now, we're on our way to
find a car at a pier in Incheon.</font>

757
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:44,120
<font color="yellow">Before today's show is over, we will
show everyone what is in the trunk</font>

759
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,320

some more over there, too!</font>

<font color="yellow">Camera.
Film them!</font>

761
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,320
<font color="yellow">Follow her!</font>

762
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,820
<font color="yellow">Turn the feed back to
what's going on in the studio</font>

763
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,820
<font color="yellow">and turn it back when
things have settled down.</font>

764
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,620
<font color="yellow">Switch to 5. Hurry.</font>

765
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,020
<font color="yellow">- Stop filming.
- Get the camera here.</font>

766
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,520

- Move!</font>
