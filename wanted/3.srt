<font color="yellow">This is the same call from before.</font>

152
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,470
<font color="yellow">It's a recording.</font>

153
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,000
<font color="yellow">I was just checking.</font>

154
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,100
<font color="yellow">To see if you are preparing the show
like I instructed.</font>

155
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,800
<font color="yellow">Or to see if you were trying
to play me to find Hyun Woo.</font>

156
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,940
<font color="yellow">I was checking on you.</font>

157
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,100
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

158
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,890
<font color="yellow">If you don't follow orders next time,
things will become a bit difficult.</font>

159
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,330
<font color="yellow">Don't pull something like this again.</font>

160
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,850
<font color="yellow">If I lose my trust in you...</font>

161
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,990
<font color="yellow">So, if I stop believing that
Hyun Woo is safe...</font>

162
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
<font color="yellow">you won't get what you want either.</font>

163
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,070
<font color="yellow">You must have wanted something too when
you made me go live on air with missions.</font>

164
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,210
<font color="yellow">I'll do it all.</font>

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,140
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is you want, I'll do it.</font>

166
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,090
<font color="yellow">Cut the feed.</font>

167
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,910
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

168
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,100
<font color="yellow">We're live right now.</font>

169
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,320
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how dangerous it is to
say you'll do whatever he wants?</font>

170
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,830
<font color="yellow">Do you plan to stop after today?</font>

171
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,910
<font color="yellow">I have no other way of talking
to the culprit!</font>

172
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,960
<font color="yellow">You're an actress.</font>

173
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,520
<font color="yellow">If you have a message to get across,
why don't you act?</font>

174
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,600
<font color="yellow">Move the viewers and earn their empathy.</font>

175
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,670
<font color="yellow">You're working right now.</font>

176
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,470
<font color="yellow">Control your emotions
and take a deep breath.</font>

177
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,480
<font color="yellow">We're going back in.</font>

178
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,990
<font color="yellow">We're coming back in.</font>

179
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,680
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go to camera three.</font>

180
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,850
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

181
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,130
<font color="yellow">Sir, are you in there?</font>

182
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,780
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

183
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,570
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

184
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,930
<font color="yellow">I'm thirsty.</font>

185
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,930
<font color="yellow">Come quickly, Mom.</font>

186
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,950
<font color="yellow">Leave that to the local precinct
and come back in.</font>

187
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,960
<font color="yellow">Tell them investigate the area
very thoroughly.</font>

188
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,840
<font color="yellow">Senior, it's me.</font>

189
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,560
<font color="yellow">They say they cannot track that call.</font>

190
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,600
<font color="yellow">It's being traced to a call in Jamaica.</font>

191
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,210
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, I'm the father
of the child on TV.</font>

192
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,290
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you back.
- Come this way.</font>

193
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,950
<font color="yellow">I'm with the police.</font>

194
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,630
<font color="yellow">- Are you the parents of that child?
- Yes.</font>

195
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,400
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me when
and where your son went missing?</font>

196
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,040
<font color="yellow">First, I need to see if my son is safe.</font>

197
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,150
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

198
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,910
<font color="yellow">Han Sol! Han Sol!</font>

199
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,710
<font color="yellow">Han Sol! My precious child.</font>

200
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,090
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at you.
Are you hurt at all?</font>

201
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,270
<font color="yellow">We carried out the mission and
the wrong child nearly died.</font>

202
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,780
<font color="yellow">The culprit called and
a child was united with his parents.</font>

203
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,830
<font color="yellow">So far, it's not too bad.</font>

204
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,450
<font color="yellow">But, it's still a little lacking
to hit 20 percent.</font>

205
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,190
<font color="yellow">Han Sol, are you all right?</font>

206
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,070
<font color="yellow">Get rid of the cameras.</font>

207
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,080
<font color="yellow">Are you using my son to find your son?</font>

208
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,700
<font color="yellow">There's a situation on scene.
Buy us some time.</font>

209
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,050
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

210
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,100
<font color="yellow">We did help find your son.</font>

211
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,980
<font color="yellow">Didn't he get kidnapped because
of this TV show?</font>

212
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,120
<font color="yellow">I'll be taking my son now.</font>

213
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,790
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Han Sol.</font>

214
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,220
<font color="yellow">Come here. Let's go.</font>

215
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,250
<font color="yellow">Come here. It's okay.</font>

216
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,790
<font color="yellow">There's something up with this family.</font>

217
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,390
<font color="yellow">We can use this for the remaining time,
so keep watch and go on air.</font>

218
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,460
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

219
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,380
<font color="yellow">Han Sol, come here.</font>

220
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,500
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

221
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,830
<font color="yellow">How did you hurt your hand?</font>

222
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,810
<font color="yellow">Ah... I hurt it while exercising.</font>

223
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,310
<font color="yellow">Is that what's important right now?</font>

224
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,340
<font color="yellow">My son is in shock right now
and he's shaking.</font>

225
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,030
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

226
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,470
<font color="yellow">Did you hit your son and his mother?</font>

227
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,040
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're saying...</font>

228
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,420
<font color="yellow">Tell us if you need help. It's all right.</font>

229
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,880
<font color="yellow">No... he's just worked up
because of our son.</font>

230
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,320
<font color="yellow">Please just leave us alone and let us go.</font>

231
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,740
<font color="yellow">Let's go on air now and
put the camera on me first.</font>

232
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,250
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can handle this?</font>

233
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,250
<font color="yellow">Do you even know who I am?</font>

234
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,410
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

235
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,940
<font color="yellow">You have to think of your son.</font>

236
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,210
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

237
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,170
<font color="yellow">I'll sue all of you.</font>

238
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,910
<font color="yellow">Turn the camera off now!</font>

239
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:14,934
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by DramaFever.</font>

240
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,830
<font color="yellow">Ah, did you see the show?</font>

241
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,950
<font color="yellow">It's a bit odd to enjoy a situation
like this, isn't it?</font>

242
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,380
<font color="yellow">You don't have to
be sorry either, President.</font>

243
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,920
<font color="yellow">We'll have to see the ratings tomorrow.</font>

244
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,060
<font color="yellow">Honestly...</font>

245
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,430
<font color="yellow">I was trying to run away yesterday.</font>

246
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,430
<font color="yellow">His father had gone on
a trip out of the city.</font>

247
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,930
<font color="yellow">But... I didn't know where to go.</font>

248
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,660
<font color="yellow">So, I went to a sauna.</font>

249
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,700
<font color="yellow">I lost him there.</font>

250
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,380
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

251
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,390
<font color="yellow">Just save us.</font>

252
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,800
<font color="yellow">Please, help us escape him.</font>

253
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,070
<font color="yellow">[JUNG HYE IN'S WANTED]</font>

254
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,130
<font color="yellow">That wasn't too bad, though it
unfolded in an unexpected way.</font>

255
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,890
<font color="yellow">We need proof that Hyun Woo is alive.</font>

256
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,420
<font color="yellow">We won't know the ratings until tomorrow.</font>

257
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,900
<font color="yellow">This isn't easy.</font>

258
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,970
<font color="yellow">There he is!</font>

259
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,210
<font color="yellow">Did you abuse your son?</font>

260
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,070
<font color="yellow">Give us a comment!</font>

261
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

262
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,380
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one thing.</font>

263
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,740
<font color="yellow">Did you rip that woman's shirt because
you really wanted to help her?</font>

264
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,690
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to do it that way.</font>

265
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,660
<font color="yellow">Or did you use her to get ratings?</font>

266
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,850
<font color="yellow">Think whatever you want.</font>

267
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,840
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

268
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,580
<font color="yellow">What if I did use her?</font>

269
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,710
<font color="yellow">I don't even have time to cry.</font>

270
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,250
<font color="yellow">Sometimes I feel like I'm going insane</font>

271
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,940
<font color="yellow">because I can't
remember Hyun Woo's face.</font>

272
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,640
<font color="yellow">I can only think of one thing.</font>

273
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,380
<font color="yellow">It's ten days.</font>

274
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,210
<font color="yellow">For those ten days,
I'm willing to do anything.</font>

275
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,940
<font color="yellow">If I hesitate for even one moment,
I could lose Hyun Woo.</font>

276
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,820
<font color="yellow">If lose the audience's interest
for even a moment...</font>

277
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,970
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo could get hurt.</font>

278
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

279
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,540
<font color="yellow">Still... shouldn't you avoid
hurting other people?</font>

280
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,100
<font color="yellow">You can never escape some
relationships without getting hurt.</font>

281
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,170
<font color="yellow">That child's mother would never have
told the truth on her own.</font>

282
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,940
<font color="yellow">Her mask had to be cracked
for her to gain courage too.</font>

283
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,560
<font color="yellow">Was there anyone you got close with
recently before Han Sol was kidnapped?</font>

284
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,240
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

285
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,400
<font color="yellow">Unless we were with his father,
we didn't really leave the house.</font>

286
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,340
<font color="yellow">Did anyone know about you and Han Sol?</font>

287
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,650
<font color="yellow">Someone who knew about your suffering...</font>

288
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,770
<font color="yellow">I believe the kidnapper knew
and took Han Sol for this show.</font>

289
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,300
<font color="yellow">I don't really know.</font>

290
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,990
<font color="yellow">My parents both passed away.</font>

291
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,380
<font color="yellow">I have no sisters or brothers.</font>

292
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,670
<font color="yellow">My husband made me cut off contact
with all my friends after we married.</font>

293
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,220
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you ever report
it to the police!</font>

294
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,430
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

295
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,260
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. It's okay.</font>

296
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,130
<font color="yellow">I was so stupid.</font>

297
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,480
<font color="yellow">I should have made sure to protect
Han Sol from him.</font>

298
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,720
<font color="yellow">Where will you go now?</font>

299
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,350
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

300
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,370
<font color="yellow">I really don't know.

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,630
<font color="yellow">You're Lieutenant Cha Seung In, right?</font>

449
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,250
<font color="yellow">I'm Jang Jin Woong from Starlight.</font>

450
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,920
<font color="yellow">- Have you checked his alibi?
- Yes.</font>

451
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,810
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're colder than I heard.</font>

452
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,960
<font color="yellow">We'll be seeing each other often.
I'm doing this story.</font>

453
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,690
<font color="yellow">I think it's best not to meet again.</font>

454
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,930
<font color="yellow">Next time, I won't be seeing you
as a reporter but as a suspect.</font>

455
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,440
<font color="yellow">That's not a bad thing either.</font>

456
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,780
<font color="yellow">You're an important character too.</font>

457
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,790
<font color="yellow">This case could make you a star or
your life could spiral out of control.</font>

458
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,830
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

459
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,790
<font color="yellow">See you again.</font>

460
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,010
<font color="yellow">Here is your order.</font>

461
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,360
<font color="yellow">Did you see "Wanted" yesterday?</font>

462
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,790
<font color="yellow">It was crazy.
Didn't Jung Hye In go too far?</font>

463
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,190
<font color="yellow">I thought she was cool.</font>

464
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,640
<font color="yellow">They didn't have much air time left,
so weren't they trying to expose him?</font>

465
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,670
<font color="yellow">Why is the kidnapper trying to expose
that man?</font>

466
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,480
<font color="yellow">Do you think Jung Hye In's son is
abused too?</font>

467
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,050
<font color="yellow">What would you like to order?</font>

468
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,070
<font color="yellow">Six iced americanos for take-out.</font>

469
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,750
<font color="yellow">Can I have three shots in one of them?</font>

470
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,360
<font color="yellow">Take UCN off the air!</font>

471
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,080
<font color="yellow">Off the air, off the air!</font>

472
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,740
<font color="yellow">The creators of "Wanted"
must be punished.</font>

473
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,790
<font color="yellow">Punished, punished!</font>

474
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,430
<font color="yellow">It was number one in ratings.</font>

475
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,610
<font color="yellow">- It was number one?
- It's all real.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Seriously...
- Do you see that?</font>

478
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,660
<font color="yellow">Maybe we should do a show like that.</font>

481
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you so much.</font>

482
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,200
<font color="yellow">- Iced americano.
- You're welcome.</font>

483
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,220
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

484
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
<font color="yellow">You brought the newspapers.</font>

485
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,660
<font color="yellow">Where's Jung Hye In?
She's not here yet?</font>

486
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,960
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I told her to come later.</font>

487
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,500
<font color="yellow">The reporters are squatting
in front of her place.</font>

488
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,960
<font color="yellow">She should rest a bit if we're going
to broadcast today.</font>

489
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,510
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, you should stay
in touch with her.</font>

490
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,350
<font color="yellow">- Don't lose her like yesterday.
- Okay.</font>

<font color="yellow">Missions are one thing</font>

492
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,890

is the problem.</font>

493
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,820
<font color="yellow">We barely made it over last night.</font>

494
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,860
<font color="yellow">Still, people will start talking today
and I think tonight will be okay.</font>

495
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,300
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's enough.</font>

496
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,330
<font color="yellow">I feel like last night was too rushed.</font>

497
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,980
<font color="yellow">We don't even know what the mission is.</font>

498
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,460
<font color="yellow">Do you have a good idea?</font>

499
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,250
<font color="yellow">What gets over 20 percent rating?</font>

500
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,440
<font color="yellow">Nothing gets that much even
on the public networks.</font>

501
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,150
<font color="yellow">Our show has to be like a drama
that people can follow.</font>

502
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,500
<font color="yellow">Though we can't plan the story,
we need a clear-cut concept.</font>

503
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,720
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In and the culprit are the
stars of this story.</font>

504
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,710
<font color="yellow">So, we need to characterize this culprit.</font>

505
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,560
<font color="yellow">Hello, hello...</font>

506
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,730
<font color="yellow">Where should I sit? Oh, thank you.</font>

507
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,280
<font color="yellow">Oh my. This is a good chair.</font>

508
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,240
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

509
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,140
<font color="yellow">We don't have to hide anything now.
We're on the same team.</font>

510
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,010
<font color="yellow">If you want to be at the meetings,
please be on time.</font>

511
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,980
<font color="yellow">We don't have time to repeat ourselves.</font>

512
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,430
<font color="yellow">What's a good nickname for the culprit?</font>

513
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,280
<font color="yellow">If we watch today's show,
we'll know what he's trying to achieve.</font>

514
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,850
<font color="yellow">It's more important to let people
understand the situation.</font>

515
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,750
<font color="yellow">We could just call him
"Hyun Woo's kidnapper."</font>

516
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,200
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure we should make it up.</font>

517
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,090
<font color="yellow">It might be better to see what people
come up with naturally on the internet.</font>

518
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,830
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

519
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,790
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

520
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,610
<font color="yellow">Why are you here again?</font>

521
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,850
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see you, Lieutenant Park.</font>

522
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,920
<font color="yellow">I had a proposal for you.
It's win-win for both of us.</font>

523
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,240
<font color="yellow">Honestly, isn't this a good
opportunity for you too?</font>

524
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,200
<font color="yellow">If you get a lead before others
and catch the kidnapper</font>

525
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,180
<font color="yellow">you'll get promoted, right?</font>

526
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,250
<font color="yellow">Isn't it time for you to be chief?</font>

527
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,970
<font color="yellow">Wait, is it way past time to be a chief?</font>

528
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,760
<font color="yellow">Go if you're going to say nonsense.</font>

529
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,720
<font color="yellow">Let's be completely
honest with each other.</font>

530
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,550
<font color="yellow">I have this case completely in my grasp.</font>

531
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,560
<font color="yellow">Gossip reporter? I'm so sick of that.</font>

532
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,320
<font color="yellow">I'm going write an article
about this show.</font>

533
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,080
<font color="yellow">I even have a contract.</font>

534
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,880
<font color="yellow">I'm going to publish a book.</font>

535
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,180
<font color="yellow">If you can get me in on this show,
I can write about all your achievements.</font>

536
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,410
<font color="yellow">I can give you useful tips too.</font>

537
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,060
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

538
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,480
<font color="yellow">I don't care about your book
or my achievements.</font>

539
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,870
<font color="yellow">If you can give me tips and info,
you might be useful.</font>

540
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,150
<font color="yellow">- Is Hye In still not in contact?
- No, not yet.</font>

541
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,630
<font color="yellow">If we get proof Hyun Woo is alive,
we need to put that on air.</font>

542
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,310
<font color="yellow">That's one of our show's obligations.</font>

543
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,740
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

544
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,490
<font color="yellow">I think we should continue looking into
the reason behind the missions.</font>

545
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,760
<font color="yellow">Why did he want Han Sol on the show?</font>

546
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,880
<font color="yellow">I don't think it was just coincidence
that it was an abused child.</font>

547
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,120
<font color="yellow">If so...</font>

548
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,980
<font color="yellow">did he want us to
expose that on the show?</font>

549
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,190
<font color="yellow">This is why you need
to work with us on this.</font>

550
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,540
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes.</font>

551
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,750
<font color="yellow">So, do you have any information
on Han Sol's case?</font>

552
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,340
<font color="yellow">Before the incident, you packed your bags
and fell asleep at the sauna.</font>

553
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,710
<font color="yellow">- That's when Han Sol was taken?
- Yes.</font>

554
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,570
<font color="yellow">Did you happen to see these people
at the sauna that day?</font>

555
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,240
<font color="yellow">Or meet them before that day?</font>

556
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,210
<font color="yellow">No, I don't know them at all.</font>

557
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,590
<font color="yellow">I didn't see them that day either.</font>

558
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,360
<font color="yellow">This girl.</font>

559
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,800
<font color="yellow">Have you seen her before?</font>

560
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,170
<font color="yellow">She told me that my dad
was almost at the sauna.</font>

561
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,470
<font color="yellow">She said I had to run away
quickly on my own.</font>

562
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,910
<font color="yellow">She said that was the only way
my mom could get away too.</font>

563
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,400
<font color="yellow">That we would get caught
if were together.</font>

564
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,450
<font color="yellow">She said we could meet up later.</font>

565
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,890
<font color="yellow">She took my hand and I followed her.</font>

566
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,080
<font color="yellow">What happened after that?</font>

567
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,580
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

568
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,520
<font color="yellow">She gave me some banana milk.</font>

569
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,020
<font color="yellow">I drank it, fell asleep, and woke up.</font>

570
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,720
<font color="yellow">And I was alone in that car.</font>

571
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,610
<font color="yellow">In that car trunk where
that lady found you?</font>

572
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,930
<font color="yellow">Han Sol, you're really smart.</font>

573
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you for helping me.</font>

574
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,640
<font color="yellow">About Han Sol's father, Professor Kim...</font>

575
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,500

<font color="yellow">Thank you for your help.</font>

578
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,900
<font color="yellow">Until everything is take care of,
you shouldn't go home.</font>

579
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,500
<font color="yellow">Do you have a place to stay?</font>

580
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,790
<font color="yellow">Until you find a place to live,
you can stay at my place.</font>

581
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,170
<font color="yellow">I live at the police station anyhow
and my home will be safe.</font>

582
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,930
<font color="yellow">Oh no, you really don't need to.</font>

583
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,730
<font color="yellow">Someone once opened their home
to me and my mother.</font>

584
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,730
<font color="yellow">I'm returning that favor,
so don't feel burdened by it.</font>

585
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,720
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

586
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,650
<font color="yellow">Bye, Han Sol.</font>

587
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,200
<font color="yellow">Well, it was definitely suicide.</font>

588
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,160
<font color="yellow">There is almost no chance
it was murder.</font>

589
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,140
<font color="yellow">His toxicology came back okay.</font>

590
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,620
<font color="yellow">This wasn't the direct cause of death.</font>

591
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,750
<font color="yellow">But, he had a large amount of pills
in his stomach.</font>

592
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,830
<font color="yellow">I think he took them before dying.</font>

593
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,330
<font color="yellow">What kind of pills?</font>

594
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,910
<font color="yellow">It's for seizures.</font>

595
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,210
<font color="yellow">It's an anti-epileptic drug.</font>

596
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,130
<font color="yellow">Taking large amounts
when you don't need it</font>

597
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,040
<font color="yellow">can cause you to become addicted.</font>

598
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,730
<font color="yellow">There are side effects like hallucination
and loss of memory.</font>

599
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,620
<font color="yellow">His medical records don't show
that he ever had seizures.</font>

600
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,070
<font color="yellow">He'd never been prescribed it.</font>

601
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,330
<font color="yellow">You've come to the wrong place.</font>

602
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,240
<font color="yellow">No one like that lives here.</font>

603
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,010
<font color="yellow">Look into Park Sae Yong's
mother's medical records.</font>

604
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

605
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,990
<font color="yellow">Also, he's a cancer patient.</font>

606
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,580
<font color="yellow">- Cancer?
- Intestinal cancer.</font>

607
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,100
<font color="yellow">It had spread to his whole body.</font>

608
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,420
<font color="yellow">You see the surgery scar?</font>

609
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,790
<font color="yellow">It's recent.</font>

610
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,950
<font color="yellow">His medical records show that they cut
him open and just closed him up.</font>

611
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,700
<font color="yellow">Even if he didn't commit suicide,
he wouldn't have lived much longer.</font>

612
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,080
<font color="yellow">Do you think it was guilt?</font>

613
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

614
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,150
<font color="yellow">The live TV, the Coconut TV kidnapping,
and this suicide...</font>

615
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,080
<font color="yellow">I think it's all been planned
down to every detail.</font>

616
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,700
<font color="yellow">He was just able to make the decision
to commit suicide because of cancer.</font>

617
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,070
<font color="yellow">For what purpose?</font>

618
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,610
<font color="yellow">John Lennon was killed
by a stalker, right?</font>

619
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,060
<font color="yellow">Jodie Foster's stalker attempted
to kill President Reagan.</font>

620
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,030
<font color="yellow">This woman...</font>

621
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,370
<font color="yellow">I happened to look into that.</font>

622
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,040
<font color="yellow">That woman with the guitar is an actress
name Rebecca Schaeffer.</font>

623
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,290
<font color="yellow">Her stalker shot her with a gun
for filming a scene in bed.</font>

624
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going meet Jung Hye In
once she arrives at the station.</font>

625
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,350
<font color="yellow">I want you to meet her manager
and look into her stalkers.</font>

626
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,760
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

627
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,230
<font color="yellow">You should've rested more.
Did you get some sleep?</font>

628
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,980
<font color="yellow">This is better than being home.</font>

629
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,010
<font color="yellow">I think I have to do something to live.</font>

630
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,020
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten yet, right?
Should I go buy something?</font>

631
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,450
<font color="yellow">No, I'm alright.</font>

632
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,100
<font color="yellow">Hye In, you're going to pass out
at this rate.</font>

633
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,660
<font color="yellow">I can wear anything from here?</font>

634
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,320
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

635
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,700
<font color="yellow">- What's this?
- Oh?</font>

636
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,290
<font color="yellow">That wasn't there at the shop.</font>

637
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,320
<font color="yellow">[MISSION ONE: SUCCESS]
[HYUN WOO IS ALIVE.]</font>

638
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,990
<font color="yellow">I left the car door open for a moment
in the parking lot.</font>

639
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,590
<font color="yellow">I had a phone call.</font>

640
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,400
<font color="yellow">That was the only time.</font>

641
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,710
<font color="yellow">I'll call the police and check the CCTV.</font>

642
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,830
<font color="yellow">Think back carefully.</font>

643
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,530
<font color="yellow">Did Park Sae Yong ever contact you
or approach you in the past?</font>

644
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,500
<font color="yellow">Have you ever met Lee Ji Eun before?</font>

645
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,200
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

646
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,350
<font color="yellow">I've thought about it hundreds of times.</font>

647
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,390
<font color="yellow">Why are they doing this to me
and why to Hyun Woo?</font>

648
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,380
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong?</font>

649
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,350
<font color="yellow">There's nothing.</font>

650
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,140
<font color="yellow">I've never even met these people.</font>

651
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:37,080
<font color="yellow">The true culprit is hiding his identity
in order to kidnap Hyun Woo.</font>

652
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,880
<font color="yellow">He used Park Sae Yong's
obsession with you.</font>

653
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,120
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong knew that he had cancer
and would be dying soon.</font>

654
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,160
<font color="yellow">He was taking drugs that could cause
hallucinations and memory loss.</font>

655
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,270
<font color="yellow">What about this girl?</font>

656
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,570
<font color="yellow">I believe Lee Ji Eun is being
manipulated as well.</font>

657
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:01,190
<font color="yellow">He sent a picture of them together means
he will continue to use Lee Ji Eun.</font>

658
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,870
<font color="yellow">After that, she may commit suicide
like Park Sae Yong.</font>

659
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,170
<font color="yellow">Or she may be murdered.</font>

660
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,670
<font color="yellow">Then... the real kidnapper?</font>

661
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,850
<font color="yellow">Is it someone near these two people?</font>

662
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,620
<font color="yellow">There's a higher chance
it's someone close to you.</font>

663
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,740
<font color="yellow">When you just heard me say this,
who was the first person you thought of?</font>

664
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:31,270
<font color="yellow">A mother's instinct can be correct.</font>

665
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,810
<font color="yellow">I can use Hyun Woo more if I need to.</font>

667
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,780

668
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,020

669
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,320

<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Thank you for your work.</font>

671
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,180
<font color="yellow">Get changed.</font>

672
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,420

<font color="yellow">You can handle meeting's
with advertisers.</font>

675
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,790
<font color="yellow">Do I have to do things like that?</font>

676
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,860
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to her regarding the case.</font>

677
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,200
<font color="yellow">You need to come, at least, once.</font>

678
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,670
<font color="yellow">Don't forget what you promised me.</font>

679
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,660
<font color="yellow">Thank you then.</font>

680
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,170
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

681
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,980
<font color="yellow">trust your husband?</font>

682
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,810
<font color="yellow">She announced her retirement
without even letting us know.</font>

683
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,330
<font color="yellow">I wondered what to do with the contract
that had six months left.</font>

684
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,930
<font color="yellow">The company was leaning toward suing.</font>

685
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,960
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have had to sue.</font>

686
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,260
<font color="yellow">We would have paid the breach
of contract penalty.</font>

687
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,430
<font color="yellow">Still, Jung Hye In's been
with us a long time.</font>

688
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,530
<font color="yellow">It's not right to do that
when people are in trouble.</font>

689
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,300
<font color="yellow">That's why we made this decision.</font>

690
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,430
<font color="yellow">Oh, thank you.</font>

691
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,160

but you don't know what to expect.</font>

693
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,130
<font color="yellow">Commercials in the middle of the show
will do very well.</font>

694
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,990
<font color="yellow">I got so many offers today,
but I left it empty for you.</font>

695
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:19,660
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved that I'm able
to return your goodwill.</font>

696
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,890
<font color="yellow">The CCTV where you parked your car
broke a few days ago.</font>

697
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,540
<font color="yellow">They haven't fixed it yet.</font>

698
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,020
<font color="yellow">- Why did it have to be there?
- Yes, why?</font>

699
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,680
<font color="yellow">Why did you happen to park there?</font>

700
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,820
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's strange.</font>

701
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,280
<font color="yellow">It was the car you drove where
the hidden camera was found.</font>

702
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,430
<font color="yellow">It was the clothes you brought where
the picture of Hyun Woo was found.</font>

703
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,540
<font color="yellow">You say you don't know anything,
but we can't confirm it.</font>

704
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,500
<font color="yellow">That's because I'm always with Hye In.</font>

705
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,230
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere for the time being.</font>

706
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:52,230
<font color="yellow">You need to stay where we can find you.</font>

707
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,860
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

708
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,450
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay even if you suspect me.</font>

709
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,560
<font color="yellow">I just don't want you to lose the real
culprit while focusing on me...</font>

710
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,060
<font color="yellow">We'll handle that.</font>

711
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,570
<font color="yellow">I heard that Jung Hye In
had some stalkers.</font>

712
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,500
<font color="yellow">Do you handle them all?</font>

713
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hye In doesn't like to make
a fuss about it.</font>

714
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,300
<font color="yellow">We don't report it to the police.
I have a blacklist.</font>

715
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,360
<font color="yellow">Has she ever been attacked
at a fan meeting or in a busy place?</font>

716
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,700
<font color="yellow">No, nothing like that.</font>

717
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,870
<font color="yellow">They usually come to her house
or send weird gifts.</font>

718
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,180
<font color="yellow">Was Park Sae Yong on that list?</font>

719
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,240
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

720
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,170
<font color="yellow">He never did anything to her
for me to know his face or name.</font>

721
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,280
<font color="yellow">I don't know him at all.</font>

722
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,960
<font color="yellow">Can I get that blacklist
and a list of her fan club members?</font>

723
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,570
<font color="yellow">I'll email it to you right away.</font>

724
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,730
<font color="yellow">I'll contact you soon.</font>

725
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,150
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you here?</font>

726
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,360
<font color="yellow">Did you get fired?</font>

727
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,160
<font color="yellow">Who'd catch the criminals if I get fired?</font>

728
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,680
<font color="yellow">You grew up. You're showing off now.</font>

729
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

730
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,360
<font color="yellow">I came to see you, Mi Ock.</font>

731
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,140
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Tell me what you want.</font>

732
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,080
<font color="yellow">I need help with something.</font>

733
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,440
<font color="yellow">I'm resting for a year.</font>

734
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,810
<font color="yellow">I have to see only
nice things for a year.</font>

735
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,480
<font color="yellow">You told me to do that.</font>

736
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,070
<font color="yellow">It takes ten days.</font>

737
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,310
<font color="yellow">Take it with you.</font>

738
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,550
<font color="yellow">Ask the department for help.</font>

739
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you bothering me?</font>

740
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,510
<font color="yellow">I don't want to do it either,
but I'm in a rush.</font>

741
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,910
<font color="yellow">If you help me this once,
I'll be loyal to you forever.</font>

742
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,100
<font color="yellow">I want to do everything that I can.</font>

743
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,510
<font color="yellow">"It wasn't your fault.
There was nothing you could do."</font>

744
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,320
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear
anything like that again.</font>

745
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,310
<font color="yellow">Take it with you.</font>

746
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,180

748
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,730
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mi Ock.</font>

749
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,660
<font color="yellow">We're having a meeting with
the investigative team.</font>

750
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,120
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

751
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,670
<font color="yellow">Did you hear from the kidnapper?</font>

752
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:46,500
<font color="yellow">I'd probably send proof of Hyun Woo
being alive to you and not the station.</font>

753
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,390
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

754
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,320
<font color="yellow">You're not a good liar.</font>

755
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,690
<font color="yellow">It's been years since I've seen you.
Don't pretend to know me.</font>

756
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,000
<font color="yellow">Come to the meeting.</font>

757
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,100
<font color="yellow">[WANTED'S SECOND MISSION
HAS BEEN EMAILED TO YOU.]</font>

760
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,970

this is Wanted's second mission.</font>

761
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,620
<font color="yellow">Let's end this show.
Someone died because of it.</font>

762
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,820
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo will die.</font>

763
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,350
<font color="yellow">They're not just scaring us.
They will really kill someone.</font>

764
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,960
<font color="yellow">Who was it that told you to do it?</font>

765

<font color="yellow">as an accomplice for
Song Hyun Woo's kidnapping.</font>

767
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,040
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for everything.
Tell me where Hyun Woo is.</font>

768
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,790
<font color="yellow">Tell me where the place in the photo is.</font>

769
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,960
<font color="yellow">Even if you go there,
there won't be anything left.</font>

770
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,020
<font color="yellow">Everything that's happening
on this show is real.</font>
