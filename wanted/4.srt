Wanted's second mission.</i></font>

is a murderer on today's show.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 4]
Who is that man?</i></font>

12
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,703
<font color="yellow">He looks familiar.
I think I've seen him somewhere.</font>

13
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,054
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min.</font>

14
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,682
<font color="yellow">He's been Hyun Woo's pediatrician
since he was a baby.</font>

15
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,704
<font color="yellow"><i>[Ha Dong Min]</i></font>

16
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,163
<font color="yellow">She's right. Ha Dong Min.</font>

17
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:19,252
<font color="yellow">Chief of the Pediatrics Department
at Soojung Hospital.</font>

18
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,872
<font color="yellow">I read an article about him recently.</font>

19
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,985
<font color="yellow">He's the Korean Albert Schweitzer.</font>

20
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,480
<font color="yellow">He started the social welfare program
at Soojung Hospital.</font>

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,069
<font color="yellow">He provided free health care to children
with cancer who couldn't afford it.</font>

22
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,531
<font color="yellow">A person like that doesn't
sound like a murderer.</font>

23
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,561
<font color="yellow">Are there articles about
medical treatment issues?</font>

24
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,051
<font color="yellow">No, there was nothing like that.</font>

25
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,638
<font color="yellow">There are only good things.</font>

26
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:45,907
<font color="yellow">He's our nation's expert in
the field of pediatrics.</font>

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,997
<font color="yellow">Especially in the field of cancer.</font>

28
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,789
<font color="yellow">I made a request before
he became Chief</font>

29
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,596
<font color="yellow">so he specially made time
to see Hyun Woo.</font>

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,299
<font color="yellow">He's someone that's trustworthy.</font>

31
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,790
<font color="yellow">He's been that way for
the past seven years.</font>

32
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:03,009
<font color="yellow">You're hiding something, aren't you?</font>

33
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,520
<font color="yellow">Usually, people would say
he's a skilled doctor.</font>

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,841
<font color="yellow">Unless you're sharing secrets with him</font>

35
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,991
<font color="yellow">it's odd to use the term trustworthy.</font>

36
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,991
<font color="yellow">I'm only saying that he's a good person.</font>

37
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,550
<font color="yellow">That's all I meant.</font>

38
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,923
<font color="yellow">Oh! She started broadcasting again.</font>

39
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,691
<font color="yellow"><i>By the way,
you were great on the last show.</i></font>

40
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:34,860
<font color="yellow"><i>That child and woman
were being horribly abused.</i></font>

41
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,610
<font color="yellow"><i>You saved them, Jung Hye In.</i></font>

42
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,911
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

43
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:57,347
<font color="yellow"><i>Also, the person who committed
the crime has been punished.</i></font>

44
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:08,237
<font color="yellow">What... what are we going to do?</font>

45
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,983
<font color="yellow">Our show...</font>

46
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:13,750
<font color="yellow">A person died because of us.</font>

47
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,269
<font color="yellow">We need to end this show.</font>

48
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,709
<font color="yellow">Wait! Let's think about this.</font>

49
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,879
<font color="yellow">Think about it?</font>

50
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,055
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to even think about.</font>

51
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:29,435
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, that person was exposed
as a wife and child abuser.</font>

52
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,512
<font color="yellow">Right after that...</font>

53
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,067
<font color="yellow">he got murdered.</font>

54
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,088
<font color="yellow">A person died because of our show.</font>

55
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:38,877
<font color="yellow">That kind of footage
can easily be produced.</font>

56
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,617
<font color="yellow">He could be alive.</font>

57
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,668
<font color="yellow">He might be doing this to capture
our interest and manipulate us.</font>

58
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,238
<font color="yellow">What if he's really dead?</font>

59
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,156
<font color="yellow">What if another person dies?</font>

60
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,649
<font color="yellow">Even so...</font>

61
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,918
<font color="yellow">That means we should go through
with the show even more!</font>

62
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,226
<font color="yellow">- Hye In.
- Hyun Woo will die!</font>

63
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,086
<font color="yellow">He's not just making threats anymore.
He is really killing people.</font>

64
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,497
<font color="yellow">A person like that is with
Hyun Woo right now.</font>

65
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,182
<font color="yellow">Hye In is right.</font>

66
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,163
<font color="yellow">If we end this right now,
we won't be able to find Hyun Woo.</font>

67
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:16,434
<font color="yellow">A person will have died for no reason.</font>

68
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:24,072
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon!</font>

69
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:25,673
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to her.</font>

70
00:05:56,117 --> 00:06:00,077
<font color="yellow">I... want to quit.</font>

71
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,199
<font color="yellow">I can't do it anymore.</font>

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,918
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

73
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,369
<font color="yellow">You should quit if you can't do it.</font>

74
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,389
<font color="yellow">It's not like I don't
understand how you feel.</font>

75
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:11,418
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay with this, Writer Yeon?
- No.</font>

76
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,665
<font color="yellow">But this is my job.</font>

77
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,526
<font color="yellow">I work hard to make my money and
I'm good enough to deserve it.</font>

78
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:24,146
<font color="yellow">This show pays a lot
and I really need that money.</font>

79
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,137
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

80
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,978
<font color="yellow">Why did you start working for this show?</font>

81
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,625
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

82
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,795
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

83
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:38,985
<font color="yellow">Should I take a guess?</font>

84
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:43,935
<font color="yellow">You couldn't find another job
with that resume.</font>

85
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,615
<font color="yellow">You wanted to grab onto this opportunity.</font>

86
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:52,485
<font color="yellow">Still, I didn't think
it would be like this.</font>

87
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:55,865
<font color="yellow">Someone has died so how
can all you be like this?</font>

88
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:09,240
<font color="yellow">Whatever the reason is,
if something big has happened</font>

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,786
<font color="yellow">you have to see it through to the end.</font>

90
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,610
<font color="yellow">That's what it means
to take responsibility.</font>

91
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,930
<font color="yellow">No matter what the result is.</font>

92
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,100
<font color="yellow">I really don't understand it.</font>

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,987
<font color="yellow">Forget about all the others,
but what about Hye In?</font>

94
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,238
<font color="yellow">How can she be so cold?</font>

95
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:26,240
<font color="yellow">This is all happening because of her.</font>

96
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,552
<font color="yellow">That looked cold to you?</font>

97
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,492
<font color="yellow">That was desperation.</font>

98
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:40,903
<font color="yellow">She's willing to commit any sin
to get her son back.</font>

99
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,942
<font color="yellow"><i>Detective Lee, I just emailed
you the blacklist.</i></font>

100
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,307
<font color="yellow"><i>I will do anything. Please let me help.</i></font>

101
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,909
<font color="yellow">Hye In, something suddenly came up.</font>

102
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,514
<font color="yellow">Is it okay if I head out?</font>

103
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,546
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, at a time like this.</font>

104
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,085
<font color="yellow">No, you don't need to worry about it.</font>

105
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,794
<font color="yellow">I'll leave the car here and be back
before the show ends.</font>

106
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,014
<font color="yellow">Call me if something comes up.</font>

107
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,043
<font color="yellow">Leave immediately if
you're going to quit.</font>

108
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,110
<font color="yellow">I won't hold you back.</font>

109
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:28,125
<font color="yellow">No, I'm sorry.</font>

110
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:33,163
<font color="yellow">Let's let the investigative team
know about this situation.</font>

111
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:35,974
<font color="yellow">They need to find Han Sol's father's body
and look for evidence.</font>

112
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,605
<font color="yellow">We should do that.</font>

113
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:40,817
<font color="yellow">We only have seven hours left.
We have to do everything we can.</font>

114
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:43,528
<font color="yellow">We'll need help from the police.</font>

115
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:46,288
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you don't need to put
in an official request?</font>

116
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,498
<font color="yellow">Then they will send me someone else.</font>

117
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,666
<font color="yellow">I'll have to report in
about every little thing.</font>

118
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,719
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come to you
if I wanted to do that.</font>

119
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,687
<font color="yellow">So you needed someone to bother.</font>

120
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,388
<font color="yellow">What if you get me fired?</font>

121
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,346
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of you.</font>

122
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,697
<font color="yellow">That works for me.</font>

123
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:03,969
<font color="yellow">But, I think your job
might be in danger too.</font>

124
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,721
<font color="yellow">I thought you were on vacation.</font>

125
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,019
<font color="yellow">Did the head office send you?</font>

126
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,457
<font color="yellow">We can't let the culprit have
his way for all ten episodes.</font>

127
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:21,331
<font color="yellow">We needed a consultant,
so I asked her to come.</font>

128
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,850
<font color="yellow">Why don't you mind your own business
and stick to your own task?</font>

129
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,192
<font color="yellow">Aren't you in charge of Lee Ji Eun?
She killed someone.</font>

130
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,515
<font color="yellow">You should've contacted us right away
once you heard from the culprit.</font>

131
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,125
<font color="yellow">You continue to keep us out of the loop.</font>

132
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,119
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. We won't do it again.</font>

133
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,533
<font color="yellow">Can we trust you on that?</font>

134
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,357
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

135
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:48,004
<font color="yellow">Director, your goal is this show
and not catching the kidnapper.</font>

136
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,413
<font color="yellow">Well, I am a person in broadcasting.</font>

137
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:54,143
<font color="yellow">I am only doing what I do best.</font>

138
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,442
<font color="yellow">The criminal should be caught
by all of you.</font>

139
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,587
<font color="yellow">I've traced the IP.</font>

140
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,922
<font color="yellow">It's Han Sol's home.</font>

141
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,590
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

142
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,240
<font color="yellow">Did you really do it?</font>

143
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,888
<font color="yellow">You didn't, right?</font>

144
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:25,727
<font color="yellow">A person your size can't control
a grown man and tie him up.</font>

145
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:28,962
<font color="yellow">If you had stabbed him deeply
that many times</font>

146
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,846
<font color="yellow">a beginner like you
would've hurt your hands.</font>

147
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,549
<font color="yellow">Who told you to do this?</font>

148
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,787
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Eun.</font>

149
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,399
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for the murder
of Kim Woo Jin</font>

150
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,398
<font color="yellow">and as an accomplice in the kidnap
of Song Hyun Woo.</font>

151
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:55,892
<font color="yellow">You have the right to remain silent
and the right to legal counsel.</font>

152
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,484
<font color="yellow">There are two possibilities.</font>

153
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:19,590
<font color="yellow">One is that Ha Dong Min paid
someone to kill or did it himself.</font>

154
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,032
<font color="yellow">The other is that is it was
a medical action that caused death.</font>

155
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:27,140
<font color="yellow">We're going to have a hard time
getting proof for either.</font>

156
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,442
<font color="yellow">We don't have time.</font>

157
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,711
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, why don't you
show us your skills?</font>

158
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,782
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

159
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,979
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

160
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:39,666
<font color="yellow">Is it possible to hack Ha Dong Min's
personal email or cell phone?</font>

161
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:44,532
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm a white hacker.
I don't do things like that.</font>

162
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,883
<font color="yellow">You don't do it or can't do it?</font>

163
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:48,434
<font color="yellow">- Well, I can do it...
- Then do it.</font>

164
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,206
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I chose you?</font>

165
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,673

than your conscience.</font>

166

<font color="yellow">What is your choice?</font>

167
00:13:56,975 --> 00:14:00,214
<font color="yellow">Do you want to stand by and watch people
die because you don't want to do this?</font>

168
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,043
<font color="yellow">We have no time for this.</font>

169
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,668
<font color="yellow">I just don't think I can do that.</font>

170
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,688
<font color="yellow">Instead, I promise I'll
get it another way.</font>

171
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,927
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

prove that Ha Dong Min is a murderer.</font>

You want to tell me not to do it.</font>

00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,804

done anything wrong, please...</font>

232
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,701
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? What did she say?</font>

233
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,095
<font color="yellow">Promise me one thing.</font>

234
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,806
<font color="yellow">I will go in first.</font>

235
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,823

237
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,573
<font color="yellow">Let's try to solve this again.</font>

238
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,276
<font color="yellow">What is the culprit's motive?</font>

239
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,801
<font color="yellow">Why did he target Ha Dong Min this time?</font>

240
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:44,525
<font color="yellow">I'm from the criminal intelligence team.
My name is Oh Mi Ock.</font>

241
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,826
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha unofficially asked
me to consult on this case.</font>

242
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:50,196
<font color="yellow">You can take a seat there.</font>

243
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,131
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min is Hyun Woo's
pediatrician, isn't he?</font>

244
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,156
<font color="yellow">Isn't this some sort of revenge
against Jung Hye In then?</font>

245
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:04,644
<font color="yellow">The culprit had a hidden camera on her
and was around her for a long time.</font>

246
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:07,478
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong took part in
the kidnapping, and he was a stalker.</font>

247
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:09,303
<font color="yellow">What about Han Sol's family?</font>

248
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,980
<font color="yellow">There is no connection to that family.</font>

249
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,579
<font color="yellow">The culprit's goal could be this show.</font>

250
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:18,615
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In and Hyun Woo could merely
be pawns to get that accomplished.</font>

251
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,392
<font color="yellow">Do you have evidence of that?</font>

252
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:22,500
<font color="yellow">Don't make up a story.</font>

253
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,589
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

254
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:29,854
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In is an actress that
everyone in this country knows.</font>

255

258
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,135
<font color="yellow">She's the most suitable candidate.</font>

259
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:44,674
<font color="yellow">The accomplices were people who would not
expose him and were easy to manipulate.</font>

260
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,035
<font color="yellow">Why would he want to do this show?</font>

261
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:49,355
<font color="yellow">You heard Lee Ji Eun before.</font>

262
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:51,461
<font color="yellow">She said this about Han Sol's father.</font>

263
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:54,349
<font color="yellow">"The person who committed the crime
has been punished."</font>

264
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,112
<font color="yellow">That's what she said.</font>

265
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:59,842
<font color="yellow">That's right.
It's not enough to call it a pattern.</font>

266
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,710
<font color="yellow">He is using this show.</font>

267
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,334
<font color="yellow">He wants to expose hidden wrongs
and then personally punish them.</font>

268
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:13,286
<font color="yellow">The first episode led to Han Sol
and his mother's abuse being exposed.</font>

269
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:16,299
<font color="yellow">Han Sol's father was revealed on air.</font>

270
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,263
<font color="yellow">They made it clear that it was punishment
and murdered him.</font>

271
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:22,030
<font color="yellow">And the second episode...</font>

272
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,863
<font color="yellow">They want us to show proof that a
supposedly good doctor is a murderer.</font>

273
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:28,894
<font color="yellow">There's one more link.</font>

<font color="yellow">Nothing like that.</font>

284
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,769
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

285
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,092
<font color="yellow">About a month ago</font>

286
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,222

290
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,809
<font color="yellow">Don't expect too much
from Lee Ji Eun for now.</font>

291
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,772
<font color="yellow">Still, she's the only thing
I can hold onto.</font>

292
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:33,830

<font color="yellow">We will only end up running
around like we did today.</font>

294

295
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:43,692
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'll end up one step closer.</font>

296
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,970
<font color="yellow">I'm at Soojung Hospital.</font>

297
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:53,039
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min will come on
the show tonight.</font>

298
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:54,500
<font color="yellow">I'll bring him.</font>

299
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,124
<font color="yellow">It's a good idea, but will he come?</font>

300
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,699
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll prepare for it then.</font>

301
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:13,622
<font color="yellow">What happened with Lee Ji Eun?</font>

302
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:16,867
<font color="yellow"><i>[Pediatrics Department]</i></font>

303
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:20,946
<font color="yellow">You want me to go on that show?</font>

304
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:23,006
<font color="yellow">I'm asking as a favor?</font>

305
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,632
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do on that show?</font>

306
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:28,876
<font color="yellow">You can address
the allegations of murder...</font>

307
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,083
<font color="yellow">Murder?</font>

308
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,903
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

309
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,528
<font color="yellow">Look here, Hyun Woo's mother.</font>

310
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,568
<font color="yellow">You've left your son in
my care for seven years.</font>

311
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:44,299
<font color="yellow">I've kept your secret
for all those seven years!</font>

312
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,988
<font color="yellow">Is this how you repay me?</font>

313
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:49,375
<font color="yellow">You're going to falsely accuse me
of murder in front of the entire nation.</font>

314
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,071
<font color="yellow">Then make a spectacle of me?</font>

315
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:53,553
<font color="yellow">I have always been grateful.</font>

316
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,980
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm giving you this chance.</font>

317
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:59,221
<font color="yellow">What? Chance?</font>

318
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:08,078
<font color="yellow"><i>[New message]</i></font>

319
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,969
<font color="yellow">I don't think calling you a murderer
is necessarily a false accusation.</font>

320
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:24,924
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

321
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,609
<font color="yellow">Why are you showing me this?</font>

322
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,635
<font color="yellow">You know her, Nurse Kim Sang Mi.</font>

323
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,199
<font color="yellow">We found her corpse in a house today.</font>

324
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:39,261
<font color="yellow">And we have evidence that
you paid someone to kill her.</font>

325
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:43,567
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

326
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:47,519
<font color="yellow">It's getting hard to listen
to this nonsense.</font>

327
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:53,786
<font color="yellow">Whether you're a murderer or not,
it has nothing to do with me.</font>

328
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:57,615
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper told me to prove it on TV.</font>

329
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,633
<font color="yellow">If I can't do that, Hyun Woo is
in danger and that's what matters.</font>

330
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:09,035
<font color="yellow">I will put these photos
and the evidence on the show tonight.</font>

331
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,019
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

332
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:17,281
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll be safe?</font>

333
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:20,462
<font color="yellow">There's only one way to stop this.</font>

334
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:23,132
<font color="yellow">You need to come on the show, yourself.</font>

335
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,155
<font color="yellow">I don't care which crime you confess to.</font>

336
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:29,742
<font color="yellow">It can be a small crime that you
can avoid legal punishment for.</font>

337
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:35,865
<font color="yellow">If you can do that...
I will keep this quiet.</font>

338
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:45,477
<font color="yellow">Just like you have
always kept my secret, Doctor.</font>

339
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,031
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

340
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:57,175
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

341
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,737
<font color="yellow">Stop airing Wanted!</font>

342
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:08,921
<font color="yellow">Stop airing Wanted!</font>

343
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,931
<font color="yellow">UCN must apologize!</font>

344
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:13,046
<font color="yellow">UCN must apologize!</font>

345
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,262
<font color="yellow">Violation of human rights.
Destroying honor.</font>

346
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:17,410
<font color="yellow">Violation of human rights.
Destroying honor.</font>

347
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,388
<font color="yellow">Apologize and compensate!</font>

348
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:21,969
<font color="yellow">Apologize and compensate!</font>

349
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,490
<font color="yellow">How are these people connected
to Ha Dong Min?</font>

350
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,875
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

351
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,317
<font color="yellow">Ah, I'm a reporter.</font>

352
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:31,684
<font color="yellow">You could do this for a hundred days.
It won't work.</font>

353
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:35,566
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you have a story.
I'll write an article.</font>

354
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:38,744
<font color="yellow">Is it good? Give some to me too.</font>

355
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,061
<font color="yellow">- Oh, that's good.
- So...</font>

356
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:45,823
<font color="yellow">Your child got free cancer treatment
thanks to Doctor Ha Dong Min?</font>

357
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,403
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

358
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,922
<font color="yellow">I had stopped working
because my child was so sick.</font>

359
00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:55,059
<font color="yellow">My husband is disabled, as well.</font>

360
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,686
<font color="yellow">I had been borrowing money
since the first surgery.</font>

361
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,171
<font color="yellow">When the cancer relapsed...</font>

362
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:04,037
<font color="yellow">we had pretty much given up.</font>

363
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:07,102
<font color="yellow">Then you heard from
the welfare department?</font>

364
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:08,913
<font color="yellow">What were the conditions?</font>

365
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:14,667
<font color="yellow">They looked at the medical treatment
we'd received and our income bracket.</font>

366
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,954
<font color="yellow">Things like that.</font>

367
00:32:15,954 --> 00:32:18,893
<font color="yellow">I just had to submit
a few documents as proof.</font>

368
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:23,645
<font color="yellow">The paperwork was done
by the welfare department.</font>

369
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:27,888
<font color="yellow">Later, we got the first examination
from Doctor Ha Dong Min.</font>

370
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,577
<font color="yellow">That's when we signed a consent form.</font>

371
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,759
<font color="yellow">A consent form?</font>

372
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,457
<font color="yellow">You know how you sign one
when you get surgery?</font>

373
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:42,000
<font color="yellow">These are kids who relapse or
don't respond well to chemotherapy.</font>

374
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:44,931
<font color="yellow">It had a list of all the drugs
they would be using.</font>

375
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:49,884
<font color="yellow">I think it was in case the results of the
treatment were not good.</font>

376
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,299
<font color="yellow">They were concerned problems would
arise even though they trying to do good.</font>

377
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:57,458
<font color="yellow">Basically, it was a form absolving them
of responsibility of the results.</font>

378
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,757
<font color="yellow">Something like that.</font>

379
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:03,032
<font color="yellow">If you wouldn't sign it,
would they not treat your child?</font>

380
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,602
<font color="yellow">But... who wouldn't sign it?</font>

381
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:09,892
<font color="yellow">They're willing to grasp any straw.</font>

382
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:13,343
<font color="yellow">Is your child all better now?</font>

383
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:14,951
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

384
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:21,362
<font color="yellow">My child was getting much better
during the first month.</font>

385
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,866
<font color="yellow">Then things suddenly got bad.</font>

386
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:29,151
<font color="yellow">Breathing became very difficult...</font>

387
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:43,159
<font color="yellow">He said we started treatment too late.</font>

388
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,926
<font color="yellow">If we had only started the treatment
a little earlier.</font>

389
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,970
<font color="yellow">It would have worked.</font>

390
00:33:54,275 --> 00:34:00,385
<font color="yellow">Still, it was because of that welfare
program that she got in the hospital.</font>

391
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:04,409
<font color="yellow">My Ji Won didn't suffer when she died.</font>

392
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,478
<font color="yellow">Reporter Jang.</font>

393
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,420
<font color="yellow">Please write a nice article.</font>

394
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,269
<font color="yellow">Doctor Ha Dong Min
is a really good person.</font>

395
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,804
<font color="yellow">My daughter left so quickly like that.</font>

396
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:32,023
<font color="yellow">He saved so many sick children
from poor families.</font>

397
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,021
<font color="yellow">Please make sure to fix this mistake.</font>

398
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:39,065
<font color="yellow">People need to know
that he's a good person.</font>

399
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,708
<font color="yellow">Everything that happens
on this show is reality.</font>

400
00:35:04,498 --> 00:35:09,021
<font color="yellow">We are following the demands of the
person who kidnapped my son, Hyun Woo.</font>

401
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,836
<font color="yellow">That is why we are
doing this show tonight.</font>

402
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:15,090
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted starts now.</font>

403
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,699
<font color="yellow">Where's Ha Dong Min? He's not here yet?</font>

404
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,382
<font color="yellow">Hold on. A car is coming in now.</font>

405
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,101
<font color="yellow">He's here. I'll be right up with him.</font>

406
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:51,067
<font color="yellow">When I saw the previews...</font>

407
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:54,251
<font color="yellow">I felt very wronged and angry, of course.</font>

408
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,931
<font color="yellow">I was scared too.</font>

409
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:05,057
<font color="yellow">Then, I recalled a case that had
bothered me for many years.</font>

410
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:09,637
<font color="yellow">If someone is accusing me
of being a murderer...</font>

411
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,885
<font color="yellow">I thought it must be about that incident.</font>

412
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:17,036
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you have
killed someone before?</font>

413
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:19,746
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

414
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:28,938
<font color="yellow">I was a first year resident.</font>

415
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,717
<font color="yellow">A patient that I was treating died.</font>

416
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,317
<font color="yellow">It was a seven year old
with leukemia.</font>

417
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:41,094
<font color="yellow">I gave that patient injections of
Cytarabine and Vincristine all at once.</font>

418
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:45,061
<font color="yellow">You cannot differentiate these two
drugs just by looking at them.</font>

419
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:48,742
<font color="yellow">Cytarabine is injected into the spine.</font>

420
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,233
<font color="yellow">Vincristine is injected into the vein.</font>

421
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:54,427
<font color="yellow"><i>If Vincristine is injected into the spine</i></font>

422
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:57,769
<font color="yellow"><i>the central nervous system
becomes severely damaged.</i></font>

423
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:59,572
<font color="yellow"><i>You become paralyzed.</i></font>

424
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,849
<font color="yellow"><i>Then you die.</i></font>

425
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:06,076
<font color="yellow">So, you made an error
and mixed up the two medications.</font>

426
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:10,559
<font color="yellow">And a seven-year-old leukemia patient
ended up dying?</font>

427
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,648
<font color="yellow">That's what the patient's
parent's claimed.</font>

428
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,277
<font color="yellow">The hospital and I claimed
that we had not made an error.</font>

429
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:23,318
<font color="yellow">We claimed that it was
an adverse reaction to the Cytarabine.</font>

430
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,351
<font color="yellow">It the trial, the hospital won.</font>

431
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:28,563
<font color="yellow">The symptoms were similar.</font>

432
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:30,822
<font color="yellow">What's the truth?</font>

433
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:39,356
<font color="yellow">It is true that I made a mistake.</font>

434
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,909
<font color="yellow">I am very sorry to
the parents of that patient.</font>

435
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:49,545
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell the truth now.</font>

436
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,030
<font color="yellow"><i>I will personally pay for what I've done.</i></font>

437
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,458
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's smart.</font>

438
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:01,054
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a big crime?</font>

439
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:03,815
<font color="yellow">It's clearly his fault
that the patient died.</font>

440
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,224
<font color="yellow">But, he won't get punished legally.</font>

441
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,630
<font color="yellow">If he was a first year resident,
it's been over 15 years.</font>

442
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,634
<font color="yellow">Those parents can't even sue him.</font>

443
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,202
<font color="yellow">Let's put up the kid's pictures.</font>

444
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:18,074
<font color="yellow">Let's get started.
Talk about the children.</font>

445
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:19,954
<font color="yellow"><i>Take a sip of water when you're ready.</i></font>

446
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:32,349
<font color="yellow">Thank you to Doctor Ha Dong Min
for your courage.</font>

447
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:39,474
<font color="yellow">However, there was no intent and it was
a medical accident.</font>

448
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:41,521
<font color="yellow">It has been more than 15 years.</font>

449
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:46,186
<font color="yellow">Can we really call Doctor Ha Dong Min
a murderer for that?</font>

450
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:53,847
<font color="yellow">These children are a part of the program
led by Doctor Ha Dong Min.</font>

451
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:57,360
<font color="yellow">Through a social welfare program for
children with leukemia</font>

452
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,978
<font color="yellow">they are children who have been
receiving free treatment.</font>

453
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:03,284
<font color="yellow">Over  150 children have
received free treatment</font>

454
00:39:03,284 --> 00:39:06,003
<font color="yellow">for leukemia in the past 3 years.</font>

455
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,318
<font color="yellow">We're coming now.</font>

456
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:13,711
<font color="yellow">If that doctor manages to run away,
you're all dead tomorrow.</font>

457
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:17,639
<font color="yellow">- Stay alert and keep watch.
- Yes, sir.</font>

458
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:25,108
<font color="yellow">Park Ji Won, Jung So Yeon,
Jang Young Min.</font>

459
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:28,914
<font color="yellow">Han Jae Woo, Kim Min Sung, Choi Eun Ho.</font>

460
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,414
<font color="yellow">These six children that you can no longer
see on the screen</font>

461
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:39,920
<font color="yellow">are children that died while receiving
this treatment.</font>

462
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:44,465
<font color="yellow">All of them improved very quickly,
in the beginning.</font>

463
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,951
<font color="yellow">Later, they experienced difficulty
breathing and swelling of the head.</font>

464
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,813
<font color="yellow">They died of severe organ failure.</font>

465
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,958
<font color="yellow">Gosh, please.</font>

466
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,835
<font color="yellow"><i>[Consent Form for Cancer Treatment]</i></font>

467
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:12,257
<font color="yellow">Thank you! Thank you so much.</font>

468
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:22,597
<font color="yellow">This is the consent form that had to be
signed in order to receive treatment.</font>

469
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:29,005
<font color="yellow">They had to agree to
a new drug called NLC136.</font>

470
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:33,715
<font color="yellow">It was a drug developed by an American
company three years ago.</font>

471
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:36,831
<font color="yellow">It has currently been recalled
due to adverse side effects.</font>

472
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:39,367
<font color="yellow">It has gone back into re-development.</font>

473
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:46,070
<font color="yellow">I realize your situation that you have
to do what the kidnapper says.</font>

474
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,574
<font color="yellow">Isn't this going too far?</font>

475
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:50,976
<font color="yellow">It is you who has gone too far, Doctor.</font>

476
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:54,996
<font color="yellow">To poor children and orphans,
sick ones, at that.</font>

477
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,918
<font color="yellow">Under the guise of treating them</font>

478
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:58,842
<font color="yellow">you ran illegal experiments
using humans.</font>

479
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:02,923
<font color="yellow">Why are you people doing this to me?</font>

480
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,853
<font color="yellow">Do you have proof?</font>

481
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:07,451
<font color="yellow"><i>They're just test subjects.</i></font>

482
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,858
<font color="yellow"><i>Have you seen an experiment end
just because one rat dies?</i></font>

483
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:16,384
<font color="yellow">Children who are sick and suffering
with leukemia...</font>

484
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:19,391
<font color="yellow">are nothing but lab rats to you?</font>

485
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:24,641
<font color="yellow">Because of your illegal human tests,
six people have died.</font>

486
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,543
<font color="yellow">- Do you admit it?
- No.</font>

487
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:29,922
<font color="yellow">That's not my voice!</font>

488
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,166
<font color="yellow">I've never said such things.</font>

489
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,521
<font color="yellow">What do you think is in this bag?</font>

490
00:41:57,612 --> 00:41:59,436
<font color="yellow">No, no!</font>

491
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:03,188
<font color="yellow"><i>How long are you going to live
just looking after patients?</i></font>

492
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:06,193
<font color="yellow"><i>Check your account tomorrow.</i></font>

493
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,592
<font color="yellow"><i>If you're satisfied,
then don't come to work tomorrow.</i></font>

494
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,576
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll take care of your resignation.</i></font>

495
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:39,911
<font color="yellow">Today...</font>

496
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,802
<font color="yellow">Kim Sang Mi was a nurse
at Soojung Hospital</font>

497
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:46,331
<font color="yellow">and disappeared last month.</font>

498
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:49,905
<font color="yellow">Today, she was found
in a home in this state.</font>

499
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:57,967
<font color="yellow">Who and why did someone
try to kill Kim Sang Mi?</font>

500
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:03,507
<font color="yellow">We will now introduce the person who
gave us the answer to this question.</font>

501
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:28,880
<font color="yellow">How are you...</font>

502
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:33,295
<font color="yellow">How am I still alive?</font>

503
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:39,963
<font color="yellow">When the man you sent was choking me,
I thought I was going to die too.</font>

504
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:44,931
<font color="yellow">If Jung Hye In had arrived any later,
I would be dead now.</font>

505
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,568
<font color="yellow">Kim Sang Mi.</font>

506
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:56,492
<font color="yellow">In the recording we just heard,
was Ha Dong Min trying to bribe you?</font>

507
00:43:56,492 --> 00:43:58,411
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was.</font>

508
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:02,387
<font color="yellow">I told him to stop the tests.</font>

509
00:44:02,387 --> 00:44:06,998
<font color="yellow">That I would tell the parents of the
children who died and authorities.</font>

510
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:12,840
<font color="yellow">Then I noticed money had
been deposited into my account.</font>

511
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:16,769
<font color="yellow">He said I was now an accomplice too.</font>

512
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:18,123
<font color="yellow">He threatened me.</font>

513
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:23,567
<font color="yellow">So, you tried to put a stop
to these horrible experiments.</font>

514
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:26,693
<font color="yellow">But, you were too afraid.</font>

515
00:44:27,663 --> 00:44:28,693
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

516
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:34,101
<font color="yellow">I should have been more courageous
and told the world.</font>

517
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:37,956
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

518
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:44,170
<font color="yellow">A burglar came into my home and
took everything in my computer.</font>

519
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:48,989
<font color="yellow">He told me he'd kill me
if I didn't leave the country.</font>

520
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:51,581
<font color="yellow">I was very conflicted.</font>

521
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:58,534
<font color="yellow">I was more scared of that
than being named an accomplice.</font>

522
00:44:58,534 --> 00:44:59,702
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

523
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:02,824
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

524
00:45:04,378 --> 00:45:07,409
<font color="yellow">You promised me!</font>

525
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:16,356
<font color="yellow">You made a promise to those kids too.</font>

526
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:18,543
<font color="yellow">To save their lives...</font>

527
00:45:55,666 --> 00:46:00,581
<font color="yellow">Your secret will no longer
remain a secret.</font>

528
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:03,237
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

529
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,914
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say,
just say it.</font>

530
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:30,014
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not mentioning
Kim Sang Mi beforehand...</font>

531
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:33,094
<font color="yellow">The secret that the doctor's referring to
is about Hyun Woo, isn't it?</font>

532
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:37,836
<font color="yellow">He's actually your ex-husband's son.
His bloodline is of the SG Group.</font>

533
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:40,155
<font color="yellow">That has nothing to do with the show.</font>

534
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:44,300
<font color="yellow">The culprit happened to focus on
Hyun Woo's doctor.</font>

535
00:46:44,347 --> 00:46:47,117
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min knows that
and is now threatening you.</font>

536
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,867
<font color="yellow">That has nothing to do with the show?</font>

537
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,735
<font color="yellow">You had to spill your secrets to me
because of this show.</font>

538
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,721
<font color="yellow">If Ha Dong Min tells everyone</font>

539
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,342
<font color="yellow">there will be more interest
in that than in the show.</font>

540
00:46:59,342 --> 00:47:01,364
<font color="yellow">SG won't let it go either.</font>

541
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:05,043
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min, President Song,
Joon Gu, and me.</font>

542
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,139
<font color="yellow">Who else knows about this?</font>

543
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:09,360
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

544
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:14,237
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll take care of this.</font>

545
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:17,007
<font color="yellow">Things might get difficult for you.
You should be prepared.</font>

546
00:47:17,298 --> 00:47:18,516
<font color="yellow">What are you planning to do?</font>

547
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,416
<font color="yellow">Let me try to see if it's possible first.</font>

548
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:22,748
<font color="yellow">Let's talk tomorrow.</font>

549
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:32,331
<font color="yellow">We haven't heard about Hyun Woo yet?</font>

550
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:36,173
<font color="yellow">Gosh! Oh, Writer Yeon.</font>

551
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:39,951
<font color="yellow">Put a cop on Kim Sang Mi
or check on her yourself.</font>

552
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,829
<font color="yellow">She went through all that
and still came on the show.</font>

553
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,081
<font color="yellow">We should protect her to the end.</font>

554
00:47:49,652 --> 00:47:50,813
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

555
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:56,501
<font color="yellow">- Executive Director.
- Yes?</font>

556
00:48:01,134 --> 00:48:02,873
<font color="yellow"><i>Check your account tomorrow.</i></font>

557
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:05,360
<font color="yellow"><i>If you're satisfied,
then don't come to work tomorrow.</i></font>

558
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,387
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll take care of your resignation.</i></font>

559
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,063
<font color="yellow"><i>What if I'm not satisfied?</i></font>

560
00:48:09,063 --> 00:48:10,085
<font color="yellow"><i>What?</i></font>

561
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:11,878
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll have to quit my job.</i></font>

562
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:15,382
<font color="yellow"><i>If this gets exposed,
I could be named an accomplice.</i></font>

563
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:18,873
<font color="yellow"><i>We could end this cleanly
if I leave the country.</i></font>

564
00:48:18,873 --> 00:48:22,273
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, was this your goal
from the beginning?</i></font>

565
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:25,554
<font color="yellow"><i>Just tell right here and now.
How much are you giving me?</i></font>

566
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:34,858
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

567
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:38,934
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me that Kim Sang Mi
threatened Ha Dong Mi?</font>

568
00:48:38,934 --> 00:48:40,384
<font color="yellow">It's not really important.</font>

569
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,349
<font color="yellow">Why does the truth matter?</font>

570
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:46,579
<font color="yellow">What matters is what
the viewers want to see.</font>

571
00:48:53,623 --> 00:48:55,061
<font color="yellow">You did a good job.</font>

572
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:57,349
<font color="yellow">By the way, Writer Yeon.</font>

573
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:04,389
<font color="yellow">Before the show, Jung Hye In told me that
the 500 million won reward was mine.</font>

574
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:06,724
<font color="yellow">That's why I came at all.</font>

575
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:09,789
<font color="yellow">That money is really mine, right?</font>

576
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:16,159
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

577
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,070
<font color="yellow">There's a procedure to it and everything.
I'll let you know.</font>

578
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,509
<font color="yellow">Bringing up money at a time like this...</font>

579
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,382
<font color="yellow">I must seem no different than
that trash, Ha Dong Min.</font>

580
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,356
<font color="yellow">No, you don't need to explain to me.</font>

581
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:36,293
<font color="yellow">There was a medical accident that
occurred at the first place I worked at.</font>

582
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:39,623
<font color="yellow">I took responsibility and testified
for the patient.</font>

583
00:49:39,998 --> 00:49:41,983
<font color="yellow">The hospital won the case though.</font>

584
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:44,733
<font color="yellow">I ended up fired because
I was a whistle-blower.</font>

585
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:49,432
<font color="yellow">After that, it became very hard to find
a job for a long time.</font>

586
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:55,552
<font color="yellow">Even if you expose the truth,
the world doesn't change.</font>

587
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:58,123
<font color="yellow">Only my life changes.</font>

588
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:03,728
<font color="yellow">Here he comes!</font>

589
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:05,817

606
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:47,364
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

607
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:49,583

for them to start talking?</font>

616
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:23,367
<font color="yellow">It hasn't even been two hours yet.</font>

617
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:24,927
<font color="yellow">I told him to stick around
after the show.</font>

618

620
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:31,365
<font color="yellow">He really doesn't listen well.</font>

621
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:38,737
