00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,080
<font color="yellow">Even the prosecutors ignored
what I said</font>

148
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,330
<font color="yellow">and covered it up.</font>

149
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,010
<font color="yellow">Now that you've stirred things up again,
those people are trying to kill me.</font>

150
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,530
<font color="yellow">Whether I get caught by the police
or go on the run...</font>

151
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,050
<font color="yellow">I will be killed by them.</font>

152
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,150
<font color="yellow">They were the ones who
caused the car accident last night.</font>

153
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,850
<font color="yellow">I want to go on your show and
tell people everything I know.</font>

154
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,960
<font color="yellow">I want everyone to be watching them.</font>

155
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,900
<font color="yellow">Even if I have to live in jail forever,
at least I'll be alive.</font>

156
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,550
<font color="yellow">And if I do end up dying,
I get to hurt them.</font>

157
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,060
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

158
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,350
<font color="yellow">I'll do it but you
have to let Hye In go.</font>

159
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,870
<font color="yellow">How can I trust you?</font>

160
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,090
<font color="yellow">How can I trust that Hye In is alive?</font>

161
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,570
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you can do
even if you don't trust me.</font>

162
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,420
<font color="yellow">Fine. Consider her dead.</font>

163
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,860
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In is locked up</font>

164
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,970
<font color="yellow">and dying in a place nobody knows about.</font>

165
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,970
<font color="yellow">You may find her later on.</font>

166
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,290
<font color="yellow">But if she can't do her show at 10:00,
her son will die.</font>

167
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,530
<font color="yellow">Sounds fun.</font>

168
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,830
<font color="yellow">How do I know you'll let
Hye In go once I put you on air?</font>

169
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,940
<font color="yellow">You have no choice in that matter.
You have to trust me.</font>

170
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,300
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

171
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,920
<font color="yellow">I could put you away now and the police
could find Jung Hye In.</font>

172
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,280
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In is not alone right now.</font>

173
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,800
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In will be dead before
the police even get there.</font>

174
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,720
<font color="yellow">Who was Jo Nam Chul's closest friend
while he was in prison?</font>

175
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,840
<font color="yellow">If he were to go to anyone for help,
it would be Park Gwang Hyung.</font>

176
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,260
<font color="yellow">Park Gwang Hyung, as in
a member of the Snow gang?</font>

177
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,860
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

178
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,450

179
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,330
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

180
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,080
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to him so move.</font>

181
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,090
<font color="yellow">He's not here right now. Please leave.</font>

182
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,560
<font color="yellow">Hey, get him!</font>

183
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,830

185
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,200
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

186
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,360
<font color="yellow">All of you, get out.
I didn't come here to see you.</font>

187
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,200
<font color="yellow">I want to talk quietly.</font>

188
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,760
<font color="yellow">Don't get yourself into trouble
for no reason.</font>

189

190

<font color="yellow">Where's Jo Nam Chul?</font>

191
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,740
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

192
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,600
<font color="yellow">Go on now.</font>

193
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,290
<font color="yellow">I don't know where he is either.</font>

194
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,160
<font color="yellow">When's the last time you heard from him?</font>

195
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,830
<font color="yellow">I heard from him about a week ago,
saying that he was getting out.</font>

196
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,970
<font color="yellow">He asked me for
Im Hyung Soon's number</font>

197
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,110
<font color="yellow">so I helped him out.</font>

198
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,540
<font color="yellow">I didn't think he'd kill him.</font>

199
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,410
<font color="yellow">He didn't say anything in prison about
Im Hyun Soon or anyone else?</font>

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,240
<font color="yellow">We did go in together seven years ago.</font>

201
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,540
<font color="yellow">He found out I was a gang member
and gave me a lot of prison money.</font>

202
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,570
<font color="yellow">So, I asked him what it was for.</font>

203
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,280
<font color="yellow">He said he had a favor to ask of me.</font>

204
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,020
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to get
rid of a body for him.</font>

205
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
<font color="yellow">A body?</font>

206
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,230
<font color="yellow">It was hidden at
a deserted airport in Incheon.</font>

207
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,950
<font color="yellow">He wasn't able to finish
that job before coming in.</font>

208
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,670
<font color="yellow">He said the person who hired him
would throw a fit.</font>

209
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,060
<font color="yellow">Was it Jo Nam Chul
who killed that person?</font>

210
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,330

Hyun Woo will be in danger too.</font>

214
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,660
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

215
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,610
<font color="yellow">About Senior Sang Shik's case
and Jo Nam Chul's parole...</font>

but that's for later.</font>

218
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,270

220
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,250

and Hyun Woo may all be connected.</font>

221
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,720

has something to do</font>

not have done it for him.</font>

them to do what you want.</font>

387

427
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,140

How is he doing?</font>

430
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,560

431
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,250

statement.</font>

433
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,380

there must have been a fight.</font>

434
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,990
<font color="yellow">Then he must have seen the killer.</font>

435

<font color="yellow">He may have.</font>

436

<font color="yellow">I looked everywhere
and there's not even a rumor.</font>

442
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,550
<font color="yellow">What about Bo Yeon?</font>

443
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,480
<font color="yellow">She talked to the detective on the case.
He said the same thing.</font>

444
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,220
<font color="yellow">We don't have enough time.</font>

445
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,820
<font color="yellow">Hye In asked for him to expose her crime
and this is the mission he gave.</font>

446
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,360
<font color="yellow">Hye In might have the key
to solving this mission.</font>

447
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,930
<font color="yellow">We have five seconds to go.</font>

448
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:34,040
<font color="yellow">Five, four, three, two, one.</font>

449
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,160
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

450
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:52,090
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

451
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,960
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</font>

452
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:03,080
<font color="yellow"><i>You may all be wondering why I'm standing
in front of the camera in this state.</i></font>

453
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,480
<font color="yellow"><i>I will explain that in a moment.</i></font>

454
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:16,830
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper made one promise
when he demanded we make this show.</font>

455
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,040
<font color="yellow">He was to provide proof
of Hyun Woo's life</font>

456
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,200
<font color="yellow">every time we completed a mission.</font>

457
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,950
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

458
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,260
<font color="yellow">Upon completion of yesterday's show,
I have not received any proof.</font>

459
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,800
<font color="yellow">I cannot continue on
with this show in this situation.</font>

460
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,090
<font color="yellow">I am demanding the
promise be kept, immediately.</font>

461
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,320
<font color="yellow">Do you think this will work?</font>

462
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,420
<font color="yellow">She has to try.</font>

463
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,090
<font color="yellow">If Hyun Woo is dead...</font>

464
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,730
<font color="yellow">there is no reason to do this show.</font>

465
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,190
<font color="yellow">If he is alive,
the kidnapper will make a move.</font>

466
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,850
<font color="yellow">It was the right move to start
today's show like this.</font>

467
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,240
<font color="yellow">We need to confirm that we are
communicating with the kidnapper.</font>

468
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,050
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom.</i></font>

469
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Sing that song for your mom.</i></font>

470
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,610
<font color="yellow"><i>The flower petals move my heart.</i></font>

471
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:46,200
<font color="yellow"><i>The flower petals brings
tears to my eyes.</i></font>

472
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,660
<font color="yellow"><i>Beautiful memories.</i></font>

473
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Blue skies.</i></font>

474
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,310
<font color="yellow"><i>I am taking it all in.</i></font>

475
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,860
<font color="yellow"><i>I kept my promise.</i></font>

476
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Show Hyun Woo to the camera.</i></font>

477
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,070
<font color="yellow"><i>The viewers need to know.</i></font>

478
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:21,200
<font color="yellow"><i>Child, do not be weak.</i></font>

479
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't carry your sadness alone in life.</i></font>

480
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,600
<font color="yellow"><i>Dad, where are you going?</i></font>

481
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,310
<font color="yellow"><i>Live with a heart like yours.</i></font>

482
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,030
<font color="yellow"><i>The biggest star...</i></font>

483
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,240
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper didn't alter his voice.</font>

484
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,180
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if Jung Hye In's
provocations from yesterday are working.</font>

485
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,220
<font color="yellow">Or if it was intentional.</font>

486
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,070
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the station.</font>

487
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,940
<font color="yellow">I want to see the crime scene
for Jo Nam Chul.</font>

488
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,740
<font color="yellow">Seung In.</font>

489
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,630
<font color="yellow">Other detectives are
already investigating.</font>

490
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,010
<font color="yellow">Trust them.</font>

491
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,490
<font color="yellow">Rest even though it's hard to rest.</font>

492
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,400
<font color="yellow">At this rate, you'll pass out
before you catch the culprit.</font>

493
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,390
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

494
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not okay with it!</font>

495
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,050
<font color="yellow">You're acting just like Senior Sang Shik
was back then.</font>

496
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,720
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

497
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,510
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

498
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,340
<font color="yellow">Now... I will reveal today's mission.</font>

499
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,130
<font color="yellow"><i>[JUNG HYE IN'S FORMER HUSBAND
DID NOT DIE IN A CAR ACCIDENT.]</i></font>

500
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,740
<font color="yellow"><i>[FIND OUT HOW HE DIED.]</i></font>

501
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,230
<font color="yellow">Many of you already know.</font>

502
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,720
<font color="yellow">After my first marriage</font>

503
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,590
<font color="yellow">my husband died in a car accident
within our first year of marriage.</font>

504
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,590
<font color="yellow">I met my current husband
afterward and got married.</font>

505
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,860
<font color="yellow">For today's mission...</font>

506
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,210
<font color="yellow">I must reveal that my former husband's
cause of death was not a car accident.</font>

507
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,960
<font color="yellow">Are you watching it?</font>

508
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,250
<font color="yellow">I want the PR and legal teams
gathered within the hour.</font>

509
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,610
<font color="yellow">Yesterday night...</font>

510
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,140
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul kidnapped
and held me hostage.</font>

511
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,590
<font color="yellow">He made a demand to the broadcast station
asking for a special live show.</font>

512
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,730
<font color="yellow">He was hired seven years ago
to murder the detective.</font>

513
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,840
<font color="yellow">He confessed that to the authorities.</font>

514
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,390
<font color="yellow">He claimed that the prosecutors
covered it up.</font>

515
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,900
<font color="yellow">Im Hyung Soon was said to have
received the same job offer.</font>

516
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,950
<font color="yellow">Unexpectedly, our show brought
attention to that old case.</font>

517
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:18,510
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul claimed that the person
who hired him was trying to kill him.</font>

518
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,600
<font color="yellow">He wanted to reveal the truth
to the entire country.</font>

519
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,920
<font color="yellow">We didn't have any
decent footage for today.</font>

520
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,310
<font color="yellow">If viewers can't handle it,
they can change the channel.</font>

521
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,980
<font color="yellow">We can see the results tomorrow.</font>

522
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,340
<font color="yellow">If you do this, the threshold for what
viewers expect just goes up.</font>

523
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,310
<font color="yellow">How do you plan on handling that?</font>

524
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,130
<font color="yellow">Worry about tomorrow when it comes.
We have to succeed today.</font>

525
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,020
<font color="yellow">You're going too far!</font>

526
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,230
<font color="yellow">If you continue down this path,
people won't be curious about Hyun Woo.</font>

527
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,750
<font color="yellow">They will only tune in to this show
to watch something outrageous.</font>

528
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,190
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of only three things.</font>

529
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,470
<font color="yellow">Mission complete, 20 percent ratings,
and a happy ending.</font>

530
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,450
<font color="yellow">I don't care why they're watching.</font>

531
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

532
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,900
<font color="yellow">You said I didn't have any expectations
from you as a human being.</font>

533
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,030
<font color="yellow">That's why we work well, right?</font>

534
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,680
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

535
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,020
<font color="yellow">I was wrong. Now, I see clearly.</font>

536
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,750
<font color="yellow">If you work with people
who have no humanity...</font>

537
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:34,770
<font color="yellow">I could be held hostage or
the Executive Director could be stabbed.</font>

538
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,460
<font color="yellow">It all becomes good footage.</font>

539
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,400
<font color="yellow">We're not people to you.
We're just like tools, right?</font>

540
00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:00,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Right before the live show,
Jo Nam Chul was found murdered.</i></font>

541
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,330
<font color="yellow"><i>At that same time...</i></font>

542
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,110
<font color="yellow">I was captured and did not know
what the mission was.</font>

543
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,500
<font color="yellow">Inside the storage unit
Jo Nam Chul locked me in</font>

544
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,030
<font color="yellow">I discovered an important clue
in solving the mission.</font>

545
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,590
<font color="yellow">These flight tickets are something only
my husband and I knew about.</font>

546
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,860
<font color="yellow">At the time of that accident,
I was...</font>

547
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,600
<font color="yellow">I was five weeks pregnant.</font>

548
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,600
<font color="yellow">My former husband said to me...</font>

549
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,950
<font color="yellow">He wanted to have our son,
leave everything behind</font>

550
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,200
<font color="yellow">and live in France.</font>

551
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,830
<font color="yellow">He was a second generation billionaire.</font>

552
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:15,030
<font color="yellow">He didn't want Hyun Woo to grow up
lonely and empty like he had.</font>

553
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,940
<font color="yellow">So, why?</font>

554
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,340
<font color="yellow">These were not found anywhere
in his belongings.</font>

555
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:28,750
<font color="yellow">These tickets were not found in our home.</font>

556
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,610
<font color="yellow">Why were they found in
Jo Nam Chul's storage unit?</font>

557
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:39,160
<font color="yellow">First mission's location, Jo Nam Chul,
and Hye In are all connected.</font>

558
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,140
<font color="yellow">Leaving that body in a similar position
as Senior Sang Shik was planned too.</font>

559
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,380
<font color="yellow">What's the one thing
that connects all of that?</font>

560
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,880
<font color="yellow">That unknown body that
the gangster boss took care of...</font>

561
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,260
<font color="yellow">We should look into that first.</font>

562
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,070
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul is dead now.</font>

563
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,710
<font color="yellow">This is everything I know, so far.</font>

564
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,460
<font color="yellow">Just like Hyun Woo's kidnapper has said.</font>

565
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,790
<font color="yellow">I do not think that my ex-husband's death
was just a car accident.</font>

566
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,960
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul may have murdered him.</font>

567
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,460
<font color="yellow">There could be another
explanation as well.</font>

568
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:29,550
<font color="yellow">In order to find solid evidence,
we will need a little more time.</font>

569
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,870
<font color="yellow">If that is what
Hyun Woo's kidnapper wants...</font>

570
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,040
<font color="yellow">I will... discover the truth.</font>

571
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,450
<font color="yellow">These are the other items that
were found in the storage unit.</font>

572
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,130
<font color="yellow">We need to find out how these items are
connected to Jo Nam Chul.</font>

573
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,600
<font color="yellow">Please call in if you have information
on these items.</font>

574
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,510
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

575
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,440
<font color="yellow">When you were being taken from the room,
you were really being kidnapped.</font>

576
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,270
<font color="yellow">Your body wouldn't be frozen
with terror if it were acting.</font>

577
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:27,140
<font color="yellow">You must have realized out that it was
Park Sae Yong who kidnapped you.</font>

578
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,600
<font color="yellow">When you met the person who got
Park Sae Yong to kidnap you...</font>

579
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,070
<font color="yellow">what did he say to you?</font>

580
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,190
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

581
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,570
<font color="yellow">Are you able to manage?</font>

582
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,220
<font color="yellow">It's probably harder than you thought.</font>

583
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,090
<font color="yellow">Being in there.</font>

584
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,380
<font color="yellow">Did your mother come by?</font>

585
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,370
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.</font>

586
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,760
<font color="yellow">So, she didn't.</font>

587
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,440
<font color="yellow">We did speak to her.</font>

588
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,250
<font color="yellow">You were on TV too.</font>

589
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,420
<font color="yellow">I told you that it doesn't matter.</font>

590
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,850
<font color="yellow">Do you hate your mother?</font>

591
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,540
<font color="yellow">Or do you hate someone else for making
you and your mom live that way?</font>

592
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,780
<font color="yellow">Before your dad passed away...</font>

593
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:37,100
<font color="yellow">I noticed that he received treatment
for depression and alcoholism.</font>

594
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,900
<font color="yellow">Did he hit you and your mother,
by any chance?</font>

595
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,340
<font color="yellow">Is that why you said people
like Han Sol's dad should die?</font>

596
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,020
<font color="yellow">Is that why you tried
to help them escape?</font>

597
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,350
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about what
you know nothing about!</font>

598
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,440
<font color="yellow">My dad?</font>

599
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,800
<font color="yellow">My dad is not that kind of person.</font>

600
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,260
<font color="yellow">My dad.</font>

601
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,690
<font color="yellow">My dad was the only person
who believed me.</font>

602
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,870
<font color="yellow">The world made my dad that way!</font>

603
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,990
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me what happened?</font>

604
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,290
<font color="yellow">Do you know who this person is?</font>

605
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,250
<font color="yellow">Is he an employee here?</font>

606
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,750
<font color="yellow">This guy!</font>

607
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,320
<font color="yellow">He works at the cafe across the street.
I go there often.</font>

608
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,400
<font color="yellow">Have you ever spoken to him?</font>

609
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,910
<font color="yellow">Just to say hello to each other.</font>

610
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,290
<font color="yellow">We heard he works here.</font>

611
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's him.</font>

612
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:14,600
<font color="yellow">If you have his resume,
can we take a look at it?</font>

613
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, sure.</font>

614
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,640
<font color="yellow">He hasn't even been here very long
and he suddenly quit on me.</font>

615
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,260
<font color="yellow">I guess he caused trouble.</font>

616
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,100
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

617
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,280
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

618
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,490
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun.</font>

619
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,780
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Excuse me for a moment.</font>

620
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,040
<font color="yellow">This is because you stole my stuff
and used it on your show.</font>

621
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,960
<font color="yellow">Then totally ignored me.</font>

622
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,130
<font color="yellow">It's all Director Shin Dong Wook's
fault, so just know that.</font>

623
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,940
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling all right?</font>

624
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,890
<font color="yellow">I'm all right.</font>

625
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,160
<font color="yellow">You should go home and rest.</font>

626
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,780
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.
Why don't you go home and rest?</font>

627
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,350
<font color="yellow">If you go anywhere or if the kidnapper
contacts you, call me first.</font>

628
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,840
<font color="yellow">Even if nothing is wrong,
contact me every hour.</font>

629
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,810
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

630
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,340
<font color="yellow">I don't want to spend time looking
for you every time we do our show.</font>

631
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,530
<font color="yellow">Okay... that's enough.</font>

632
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,220
<font color="yellow">Today's mission...</font>

633
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,650
<font color="yellow">Do you think we succeeded?</font>

634
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,640
<font color="yellow">It has to be.</font>

635
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,960
<font color="yellow">My Hyun Woo has to be safe.</font>

636
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,650
<font color="yellow">He didn't say to provide evidence.</font>

637
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,680
<font color="yellow">This could have been extent
of the kidnapper's intent.</font>

638
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,940
<font color="yellow">My Hyun Woo.</font>

639
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,640
<font color="yellow">When I was trying to stop
Ha Dong Min's lawyer...</font>

640
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,310
<font color="yellow">I agreed to give him up to SG Group.</font>

641
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,740
<font color="yellow">If I knew I was going to expose it today,
I wouldn't have made that agreement.</font>

642
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,540
<font color="yellow">I would have protected him
until the very end.</font>

643
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,090
<font color="yellow">Saving his life was the priority.</font>

644
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,310
<font color="yellow">You did what you had to do.</font>

645
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,220
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

646
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,880
<font color="yellow"><i>[UNKNOWN CALLER]</i></font>

647
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,730
<font color="yellow">Mom. It's me, Hyun Woo.</font>
