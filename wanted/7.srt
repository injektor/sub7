there's a really big swimming pool.</font>

90
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:32,221
<font color="yellow">Just before Jo Nam Chul's estimated time
of death at 6:40 p.m.</font>

91
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,806
<font color="yellow">he was caught on UCN's CCTV.</font>

92

<font color="yellow">The kidnapper that Jung Hye In
saw during Hyun Woo's escape</font>

93
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:42,240
<font color="yellow">was confirmed to be him.</font>

94
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,420
<font color="yellow">We found the person that has Hyun Woo.</font>

95
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,120
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun.</font>

96
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,651
<font color="yellow">I see it wasn't in the plans for
Na Soo Hyun to be exposed now.</font>

97
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:05,014
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun was the one who killed
Han Sol's father, wasn't it?</font>

98
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,882
<font color="yellow">You, Na Soo Hyun, and Park Sae Yong...</font>

99
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:14,003
<font color="yellow">how are you three connected?</font>

100
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:25,463
<font color="yellow">You started meeting Park Sae Yong
one month before Hyun Woo was kidnapped.</font>

101
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:32,006
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun started working at the cafe
by UCN two months before the kidnapping.</font>

102
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,996
<font color="yellow">When was this entire plan made?</font>

103
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,102
<font color="yellow">Has his place of residence been found?</font>

104
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:48,231
<font color="yellow">His place of residence was unknown,
so his resident registry was canceled.</font>

105
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,405
<font color="yellow">What about his family?</font>

106
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,108
<font color="yellow">He currently has no family.</font>

107
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:55,021
<font color="yellow">Both his parents died in an accident when
he was 16 years old.</font>

108
00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:00,271
<font color="yellow">Nine years before he entered the army,
his six year old sister died of illness.</font>

109
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:02,543
<font color="yellow">He has a brother four years older.</font>

110
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:05,021
<font color="yellow">But, he was reported missing
seven years ago.</font>

111
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:09,204
<font color="yellow">His case is still unsolved.</font>

112
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:12,616
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

113
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:17,266
<font color="yellow">If only I had caught him,
Jo Nam Chul could've made his statement.</font>

114
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,574
<font color="yellow">And Hyun Woo...</font>

115
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,424
<font color="yellow">Is it okay for you to be
discharged so quickly?</font>

116
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:25,613
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

117
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:28,377
<font color="yellow">I only needed to get some stitches.</font>

118
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,014
<font color="yellow">I just need to be careful moving around.</font>

119
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,926
<font color="yellow">I don't understand how could that be.</font>

120
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,568
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

121
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:40,459
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun went after
Jo Nam Chul to kill him.</font>

122
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,612
<font color="yellow">If you had tried to stop him
and you were there...</font>

123
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,399
<font color="yellow">how could you be so unharmed and
come out with minor injuries?</font>

124
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,949
<font color="yellow">- Jung Hye In.
- No, no.</font>

125
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:54,227
<font color="yellow">I understand Hye In's point of view.</font>

126
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,960
<font color="yellow">It all happened so quickly, so...</font>

127
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:02,795
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun had no reason
to kill Joon Gu.</font>

128
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,530
<font color="yellow">He was just someone getting in
the way of killing Jo Nam Chul.</font>

129
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,734
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

130
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,977
<font color="yellow">Get some rest today for the show later.</font>

131
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:17,396
<font color="yellow">We'll be getting prepared for it.
Take your time coming out.</font>

132
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:21,967
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that.
Let's head out together.</font>

133
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,982
<font color="yellow">He told me to wait for the next mission.</font>

134
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,092
<font color="yellow">He usually sends you
the mission directly.</font>

135
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:29,745
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything on your own,
and call us right away.</font>

136
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,714
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director Shin.</font>

137
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:42,996
<font color="yellow">I think I need to head out because of
a tip we got about the silver ring.</font>

138
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,784
<font color="yellow">I think there might be something there.</font>

139
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:46,572
<font color="yellow">It could be nothing but I need to check.</font>

140
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,462
<font color="yellow">I'll film everything we discuss
and give you a call.</font>

141
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:54,164
<font color="yellow">Sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.</font>

142
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:55,620
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

143
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:21,540
<font color="yellow">This used to be my store.</font>

144
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,839
<font color="yellow">I wasn't much of a businessman.</font>

145
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,080
<font color="yellow">I'm an old local in this neighborhood.</font>

146
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,107
<font color="yellow">Now, there are many young people here.</font>

147
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,666
<font color="yellow">The old ways won't do anymore.</font>

148
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,356
<font color="yellow">My son over there changed
everything in here.</font>

149
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,135
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

150
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,019
<font color="yellow">What about the silver ring
you called to tell me about?</font>

151
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,320
<font color="yellow">You'll see when I show you.</font>

152
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,188
<font color="yellow">They wanted to buy Young Hyun
a gift for her fifth birthday.</font>

153
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:55,799
<font color="yellow">Her older brothers came here
to ask me to make something.</font>

154
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,088
<font color="yellow">Young Hyun?</font>

155
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:58,736
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

156
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:01,713
<font color="yellow">She was a girl who lived
in this neighborhood.</font>

157
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:07,107
<font color="yellow">She had two brothers that
were a lot older than her.</font>

158
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:11,620
<font color="yellow">I have a picture.</font>

159
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,401
<font color="yellow">Here it is. This is the picture.</font>

160
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:21,018
<font color="yellow">They were good kids.</font>

161
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,471
<font color="yellow">They didn't have parents.</font>

162
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:26,552
<font color="yellow">Two guys were raising this little girl.</font>

163
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:31,771
<font color="yellow">When they would go out to work,
Young Hyun would come here to play.</font>

164
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:35,405
<font color="yellow">Do you happen to know the names
of those brothers?</font>

165
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:38,844
<font color="yellow">Yes, their last name is Na.</font>

166
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:41,419
<font color="yellow">The older one is Jae Hyun.</font>

167
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:44,984
<font color="yellow">The younger one is Soo Hyun.
That's right.</font>

168
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,123
<font color="yellow">- Na Soo Hyun?
- Yes.</font>

169
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:57,423
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'm going to make a call.</font>

170
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,857
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

171
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:03,117
<font color="yellow">Oh, excuse me.</font>

172
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,351
<font color="yellow">Our tip lead to some
useful information, right?</font>

173
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,934
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you so much.</font>

174
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,892
<font color="yellow">- Then how much do we get?
- Excuse me?</font>

175
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:15,628
<font color="yellow">Last time, there was a reward
of 500 million won.</font>

176
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:20,356
<font color="yellow">Ah, well I can't really
make those decisions.</font>

177
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:21,816
<font color="yellow">There's nothing?</font>

178
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:25,647
<font color="yellow">Even the police pay you something
if you call in with a tip.</font>

179
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,181
<font color="yellow">She's doing a show to find her son and
she didn't even think of reward money?</font>

180
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,444
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the information.</font>

181
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:45,963
<font color="yellow">I'll look into what you're asking
about and let you know.</font>

182
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,194
<font color="yellow">I found the owner of the silver ring
that we had on our show.</font>

183
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:58,909
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun and his brother got it
made for their sister's birthday.</font>

184
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:03,572
<font color="yellow">The J is for Na Jae Hyun.
The S is for Na Soo Hyun.</font>

185
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:05,835
<font color="yellow">The Y is for the sister Na Young Hyun.</font>

186
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:07,800
<font color="yellow">The bracelet belongs to the youngest.</font>

187
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,147
<font color="yellow">Then the ring from Jo Nam Chul's
storage unit belongs to...</font>

188
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:12,983
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun was reported missing</font>

189
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:14,820
<font color="yellow">so it's very likely that
it belongs to him.</font>

190
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,438
<font color="yellow">Suppose that Jo Nam Chul
killed Na Jae Hyun.</font>

191
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:22,228
<font color="yellow">What if Na Soo Hyun killed Jo Nam Chul
to get revenge for his brother?</font>

192
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:27,241
<font color="yellow">So, is this helpful
to your investigation?</font>

193
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,676
<font color="yellow">Of course. Thank you.</font>

194
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:34,298
<font color="yellow">But, why did you bring it to us first
instead of the broadcast team?</font>

195
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:39,808
<font color="yellow">I wanted to get your permission first
to see if this was okay to air.</font>

196
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:43,915
<font color="yellow">If you think it might be better not
to air in order to capture him...</font>

197
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:46,308
<font color="yellow">I won't tell the broadcast team about it.</font>

198
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,132
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

199
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,861
<font color="yellow">Our show...</font>

200
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,993
<font color="yellow">it's staring to scare me more and more.</font>

201
00:19:56,934 --> 00:20:00,666
<font color="yellow">I try to think to myself that we have
no choice in order to save Hyun Woo.</font>

202
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:04,787
<font color="yellow">People keep dying and our team
gets put in danger, as well.</font>

203
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,695
<font color="yellow">Yet, everything continues trying to make
things more provocative.</font>

204
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,893
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried.</font>

205
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,567
<font color="yellow">Yes, this Yeon Woo Jin.</font>

206
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,734
<font color="yellow"><i>You're the writer for Wanted, right?</i></font>

207
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,049
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

208
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:31,748
<font color="yellow"><i>You murderers.</i></font>

209
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,032
<font color="yellow"><i>You are all murderers.</i></font>

210
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:37,653
<font color="yellow">I'm going to hang up now.</font>

211
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,471
<font color="yellow"><i>You continue to make
a show to get ratings</i></font>

212
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,288

213
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:45,954
<font color="yellow"><i>If you don't put a stop to this show now,
I'll kill all of you myself!</i></font>

214
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,012
<font color="yellow">This is Shin Dong Wook from UCN.</font>

215
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,128
<font color="yellow"><i>How could you make a show like this?</i></font>

216
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:27,608
<font color="yellow"><i>You knew a person died because of
your show and you still continued?</i></font>

217
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:28,889
<font color="yellow"><i>Isn't that a crime?</i></font>

218
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,627
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

219
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:33,674
<font color="yellow"><i>It's in the article. It's all online.</i></font>

221
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,153
<font color="yellow"><i>But, you hid that.</i></font>

222
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:45,600
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

223
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,633
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Wanted...</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Wanted Promoting Murder]</i></font>

225
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:11,763
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

226
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:20,672
<font color="yellow"><i>[The Wanted crew knew about the murder,

230
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:40,338

follow the logic of punishing by death."</font>

231

233
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,628
<font color="yellow">Who wrote this?</font>

234
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,442
<font color="yellow">Jang Jin Woong from Starlife.</font>

235
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,325
<font color="yellow">Wow, Director Shin finally called me.</font>

236
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,694
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you that I would?</font>

237
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:11,607
<font color="yellow">Well, you used all my information
I gathered on Lieutenant Cha Seung In.</font>

238
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,726
<font color="yellow">Then I didn't hear from you.</font>

239
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,107
<font color="yellow">I took that to mean
I could do things my way.</font>

240
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:17,236
<font color="yellow">What about the video?</font>

241
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:19,328
<font color="yellow">Where did you get it?</font>

242
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,578
<font color="yellow">I can't give you my sources.</font>

243
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,849
<font color="yellow"><i>By the way, you were
great on the last show.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>You saved them, Jung Hye In.</i></font>

246
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,261
<font color="yellow">Why don't you join
our team starting today?</font>

247
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:53,351
<font color="yellow">How can I join your team when
I wrote an article like this?</font>

248
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,164
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have
multiple personalities.</font>

249
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:56,582
<font color="yellow">Write an article amending it.</font>

250
00:23:56,582 --> 00:24:00,167
<font color="yellow">Get people to turn their attention
elsewhere so that we can do our show.</font>

251
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,926
<font color="yellow">How can I change facts?</font>

252
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:04,806
<font color="yellow">You can change the reason
for why it was done.</font>

253
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:10,086
<font color="yellow">We will say the police made the decision,
to keep Hyun Woo safe.</font>

254
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,278
<font color="yellow">We'll supplement that with
an interview from within our team.</font>

255
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:14,328
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

256
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,203
<font color="yellow">Let's get people's interest turned
away from our morals</font>

257
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:20,228
<font color="yellow">and back to the kidnapper.</font>

258
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,017
<font color="yellow">Let's focus on what's been exposed.</font>

259
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,963
<font color="yellow">There is the girl in the video,
Lee Ji Eun.</font>

260
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,121
<font color="yellow">You're really something, aren't you?</font>

261
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:33,623
<font color="yellow">Reporter Jang, wasn't this
your goal to begin with?</font>

262
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:37,342
<font color="yellow">No matter what happened in the end,
there was no loss for me.</font>

263
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:39,835
<font color="yellow">So, I took a gamble.</font>

264
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:50,250
<font color="yellow">If you were going to ask a favor,
you shouldn't have caused trouble.</font>

265
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:52,539
<font color="yellow">How could you let this happen?</font>

266
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:54,788
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

267
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:57,758
<font color="yellow">Help me just this once.</font>

268
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:02,892
<font color="yellow">Tell people that the video of the murder
wasn't released due to investigation.</font>

269
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:07,646
<font color="yellow">- Let us announce...
- You want us to take the blame!</font>

270
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:12,267
<font color="yellow">It would look better for the police
to make that statement.</font>

271
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:16,806
<font color="yellow">We need an explanation for
our knowledge of that video.</font>

272
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:24,216
<font color="yellow">We will handle things on our side.</font>

273
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,225
<font color="yellow">Police Commissioner!</font>

274
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,175
<font color="yellow">Attention, everyone.</font>

275
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,789
<font color="yellow">This is an order directly
from the commissioner.</font>

276
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,169
<font color="yellow">Starting now, we will no longer
be working with the broadcast team.</font>

277
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,329
<font color="yellow">Chief!</font>

278
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:49,305
<font color="yellow">Because we were in charge of this case,
I will be responsible for what happened.</font>

279
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:50,306
<font color="yellow">It was a mistake.</font>

280
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:51,587
<font color="yellow">Why should you?</font>

281
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:52,884
<font color="yellow">They're cutting tail.</font>

282
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,630
<font color="yellow">When was it that they were telling
us to cooperate with the show?</font>

283
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:59,019
<font color="yellow">Then what will happen to us?</font>

284
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,489
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have be off
the case completely.</font>

285
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:06,107
<font color="yellow">All of you will join the new team that's
been formed at national headquarters.</font>

286
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,165
<font color="yellow">You will be investigating
the "Wanted" murders.</font>

287
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,855
<font color="yellow">That means the broadcast team
are all suspects too.</font>

288
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:13,104
<font color="yellow">That's good. I'm fine with that.</font>

289
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,342
<font color="yellow">This is the way it should be.</font>

290
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,531
<font color="yellow">A kidnapping case has turned
into a murder case.</font>

291
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:21,691
<font color="yellow">It's not right for the police to be
manipulated by the culprit like this.</font>

292
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:23,263
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a part of it.</font>

293
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,859
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be in the new team.</font>

294
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:33,601
<font color="yellow">Come out. Talk to me outside.</font>

295
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:43,861
<font color="yellow">Let me do what I've been doing and
stay with the broadcast team.</font>

296
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,671
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

297
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,340
<font color="yellow">You're all after the same culprit.</font>

298
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,146
<font color="yellow">The person you're after</font>

299
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:51,952
<font color="yellow">is the same person
they're trying to catch.</font>

300
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:54,200
<font color="yellow">- I know, but...
- But, what?</font>

301
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:57,603
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo will die if they fail
even one mission.</font>

302
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,621
<font color="yellow">They can't do it without help
from the police.</font>

303
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:01,758
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

304
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,087
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In is in isolation right now.</font>

305
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:08,886
<font color="yellow">She can't trust her husband,
the team, or anyone.</font>

306
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:10,646
<font color="yellow">She got kidnapped herself</font>

307
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,396
<font color="yellow">and got Hyun Woo
snatched away from her again.</font>

308
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:14,913
<font color="yellow">She's dealing with that all by herself.</font>

309
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,700
<font color="yellow">Officially, I can't allow this.</font>

310
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:20,739
<font color="yellow">- I clearly said no.
- Chief!</font>

311
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:29,990
<font color="yellow">If you're going to join the team,
take care of the old, backed up cases.</font>

312
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,889
<font color="yellow">You have so much paperwork backed up.</font>

313
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,300
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

314
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:41,863
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not doing this
to give you more time.</font>

315
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:45,226
<font color="yellow">I can't cover for you if you go to
national police headquarters.</font>

316
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:48,255
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you out because you might
go and cause trouble there.</font>

317
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:51,905
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir!</font>

318
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:56,005
<font color="yellow">I might get suspended for a bit or
get some sort of punishment.</font>

319
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,316
<font color="yellow">But, let me know if you need anything.</font>

320
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:02,736
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

321
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,435
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

322
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:15,726
<font color="yellow">What did you decide to do?</font>

323
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:20,243
<font color="yellow">I decided to let him stay because
he might go and cause trouble.</font>

324
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:21,894
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

325
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:24,995
<font color="yellow">Then what about me?</font>

326
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:27,669
<font color="yellow">You should join the new team, of course.</font>

327
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,217
<font color="yellow">Chief...</font>

328
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,105
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

329
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:37,385
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how can I send off this
little kid without his senior?</font>

330
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:40,855
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take this opportunity
to teach him well?</font>

331
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:42,626
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

332
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:48,621
<font color="yellow">We've taken care of
the article issue somewhat.</font>

333
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,079
<font color="yellow">Why isn't the mission coming?</font>

334
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,165
<font color="yellow">Let's do what we can before that.</font>

335
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:57,254
<font color="yellow">This might be better for the preview
than anything related to the mission.</font>

336
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,277
<font color="yellow">It gives people a reason to watch.</font>

337
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:06,404
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Hye In, you have
completed your fourth mission.</i></font>

338
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:09,424
<font color="yellow"><i>I assume you've confirmed
that Hyun Woo is alive.</i></font>

339
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:11,018
<font color="yellow"><i>Go back now and
wait for your next mission.</i></font>

340
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,982
<font color="yellow">Let's use a voice actor,
record it, and play it.</font>

341
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,182
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to film it.</font>

342
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:18,932
<font color="yellow">Why don't we use captions?</font>

343
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,280
<font color="yellow">That won't do.</font>

344
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:24,923
<font color="yellow">The point of this preview is to make
people feel something for Jung Hye In.</font>

345
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,732
<font color="yellow">A drama between the culprit
and Jung Hye In.</font>

346
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,607
<font color="yellow">You said it, Writer Yeon. Did you forget?</font>

347
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,337
<font color="yellow">- But, it's fake...
- Get it together.</font>

348
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:35,209
<font color="yellow">If it's going to bother your conscience,
you shouldn't have started this.</font>

349
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,746
<font color="yellow">Why are we doing this show?</font>

350
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,896
<font color="yellow">I guess we have no choice</font>

351
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:46,367
<font color="yellow">if we need people to
realize this show is about Hyun Woo.</font>

352
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,606
<font color="yellow">Talk to Bo Yeon and get her on it.</font>

353
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,435
<font color="yellow">Manipulate the voice and make it scary.</font>

354
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:56,667
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

355
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,073
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

356
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:13,357
<font color="yellow">I thought I should ask you how you felt.</font>

357
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:17,018
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

358
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:23,113
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In, I know you never
cry in front of others.</font>

359
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:26,261
<font color="yellow">But, now you have
to show yourself like this.</font>

360
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:29,072
<font color="yellow">Plus we're going to use
a fake voice for the kidnapper.</font>

361
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:33,623
<font color="yellow">We don't know how he will react.</font>

362
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:36,302
<font color="yellow">What are your thoughts on this?</font>

363
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:40,621
<font color="yellow">As a writer or a human being?</font>

364
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:42,800
<font color="yellow">A writer.</font>

365
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,598
<font color="yellow">Today's show. No...</font>

366
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,349
<font color="yellow">Do you think it will be helpful
in all our future shows?</font>

367
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,731
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it will be helpful in swaying
the people's opinions.</font>

368
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,180
<font color="yellow">Then do it.</font>

369
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,608
<font color="yellow">Make his voice sound scary and use music.</font>

370
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,714
<font color="yellow">Do everything that you can.</font>

371
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:07,269
<font color="yellow">Besides getting Hyun Woo back unharmed...</font>

372
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,249
<font color="yellow">I have nothing left to protect.</font>

373
00:31:14,936 --> 00:31:17,162
<font color="yellow">Both you and Director Shin Dong Wook...</font>

374
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:20,395
<font color="yellow">you are oddly alike.</font>

375
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,078
<font color="yellow">I understand what you're saying.</font>

376
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,572
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

377
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:43,273
<font color="yellow">It's not a good time for me right now.</font>

378
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,772
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll be there.</font>

379
00:31:54,764 --> 00:31:56,866
<font color="yellow">I need to go somewhere.</font>

380
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:59,547
<font color="yellow">- If the mission arrives...
- I'll call you right away.</font>

381
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:12,743
<font color="yellow">It would've been nice if you told me
before I saw it on TV.</font>

382
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,492
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that.</font>

383
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,664
<font color="yellow">Are you positive about it?</font>

384
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:21,552
<font color="yellow">Was Tae Young's death not an accident?</font>

385
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:25,009
<font color="yellow">I can't be positive,
but there is a good possibility.

00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,409
<font color="yellow">In order to save Hyun Woo,
I had to grab onto that possibility.</font>

387
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,681
<font color="yellow">That possibility...
I want to look into, as well.</font>

388
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,730
<font color="yellow">If Tae Young died that way,
I have to make it right.</font>

your show in a difficult position.</font>

392

its complete support.</font>

393

let you know if I find out anything.</font>

00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:26,278
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun, the younger brother of
Na Jae Hyun who's been missing.</font>

446
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,348
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun?</font>

447
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:36,330
<font color="yellow">- Park Bo Yeon.
- Yes?</font>

448
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,892
<font color="yellow">Call Lieutenant Cha, tell him everything,
and ask him for help.</font>

449
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,600
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time
until the show starts.</font>

450
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,778
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

451
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:49,272
<font color="yellow">Why did Na Soo Hyun
do this to you, Detective Ko?</font>

452
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,519
<font color="yellow">Because I didn't find his brother.</font>

453
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:56,624
<font color="yellow">It's been seven years, so why now?</font>

454
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:00,383
<font color="yellow">What was the situation regarding
Na Jae Hyun's case?</font>

455
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:03,756
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

456
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:10,466
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago, Na Soo Hyun
reported Na Jae Hyun missing.</font>

457
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:12,765
<font color="yellow">That was in mid-September.</font>

458
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:15,151
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun couldn't reach him
for two months</font>

459
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,097
<font color="yellow">before he was discharged from army.</font>

460
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:19,464
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago?</font>

461
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:24,055
<font color="yellow">When did he last have contact
with someone?</font>

462
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:30,024
<font color="yellow">July 12.</font>

463
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,615
<font color="yellow">He had gone to work on that day.</font>

464
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:36,156
<font color="yellow">July 12?</font>

465
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:42,743
<font color="yellow">July 12, that day was...</font>

466
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,138
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

467
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:48,591
<font color="yellow">That's the day before my husband
died in the car accident.</font>

468
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:56,198
<font color="yellow"><i>[September 2009]</i></font>

469
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:03,191
<font color="yellow">So, he stopped coming to work
after July 12 and didn't call?</font>

470
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:04,321
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

471
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,841
<font color="yellow">Nothing seemed strange
the last time you saw him?</font>

472
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:12,490
<font color="yellow">He usually comes to work on his bicycle.</font>

473
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,850
<font color="yellow">When he was going home that day,
he was getting into a foreign luxury car.</font>

474
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:18,839
<font color="yellow">Someone seemed to be picking him up.</font>

475
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,680
<font color="yellow">Did you see who was driving?</font>

476
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,982
<font color="yellow">No, the car windows
were very darkly tinted.</font>

477
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:29,816
<font color="yellow">What about the car model?
Do you know what kind?</font>

478
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:32,327
<font color="yellow">It was a black Rolls Royce.</font>

479
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,341
<font color="yellow">A black Rolls Royce.</font>

480
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:40,595
<font color="yellow">That was Tae Young's car.</font>

481
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:43,202
<font color="yellow">There wouldn't be many
of those in this country.</font>

482
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,129
<font color="yellow">So, Na Jae Young
met Ham Tae Young that day.</font>

483
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,488
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young died in
an accident the next day.</font>

484
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,673
<font color="yellow">And Na Jae Young went missing after that?</font>

485
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,709
<font color="yellow">We did have proof that
other owners of that car</font>

486
00:41:56,709 --> 00:41:59,222
<font color="yellow">were in other places at that time.</font>

487
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:03,952
<font color="yellow">If you knew all of that,
why didn't the investigation continue?</font>

488
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,698
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha, I think
you need to come now.</font>

489
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:22,466
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

490
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:25,495
<font color="yellow">He was the detective in charge of
Na Jae Hyun's missings person case.</font>

491
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:26,975
<font color="yellow">All right, we'll be right there.</font>

492
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:29,977
<font color="yellow">We're in the area so it won't take long.</font>

493
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,477
<font color="yellow"><i>[Met with Detective Ko Hyung Joon.]</i></font>

494
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,640
<font color="yellow"><i>[Stopped investigating due
to orders from above.]</i></font>

495
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:45,406
<font color="yellow"><i>[He is hiding something.
What is the connection?]</i></font>

496
00:42:45,406 --> 00:42:46,716
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

497
00:42:56,678 --> 00:42:58,048
<font color="yellow">It's Na Soo Hyun.</font>

498
00:43:33,008 --> 00:43:34,312
<font color="yellow">What's your problem?</font>

499
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:45,963
<font color="yellow"><i>Why was Detective Kim Sang Shik
digging into my brother's case?</i></font>

500
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:51,473
<font color="yellow"><i>And what did he find out that
got him killed by Jo Nam Chul?</i></font>

501
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:55,100
<font color="yellow"><i>Find out before it's too late.</i></font>

502
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,803
<font color="yellow">Did Detective Kim Sang Shik
meet with you?</font>

503
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:10,002
<font color="yellow">Let go! Who's Kim Sang Shik?</font>

504
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:14,100
<font color="yellow">The detective who came to you asking
about Na Jae Hyun seven years ago.</font>

505
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,178
<font color="yellow">I don't know anyone like that.</font>

506
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:19,555
<font color="yellow">No... you know him.</font>

507
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:22,314
<font color="yellow">You definitely remember him.</font>

508
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:25,062
<font color="yellow">Tell me. What did you say to him?</font>

509
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:30,868
<font color="yellow">What did you tell him
that got him killed, you punk!</font>

510
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:36,341
<font color="yellow">- Senior...
- Let me go!</font>

511
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:41,285
<font color="yellow">Senior, Senior! You could get in trouble!</font>

512
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:44,517
<font color="yellow">The show is starting soon.</font>

513
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,089
<font color="yellow">Whether you kill him or not,
do it after the show.</font>

514
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:52,461
<font color="yellow">I got an order from the higher-ups
to stop my investigation.</font>

515
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:54,888
<font color="yellow">That's all I did wrong and...</font>

516
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,617
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any evidence either.</font>

517
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:04,151
<font color="yellow">Later, I got an call from Im Hyung Soon
that he had a tip for me.</font>

518
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:06,093
<font color="yellow">I had already dropped the
case by that point.</font>

519
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,470
<font color="yellow">That detective Kim Sang Shik...</font>

520
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,361
<font color="yellow">He was asking a lot of questions.</font>

521
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:14,028
<font color="yellow">I only told him the location where
he could meet Im Hyung Soon.</font>

522
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,457
<font color="yellow">Don't drink so much.</font>

523
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:23,265
<font color="yellow">- Stop lying.
- I'm choosing not to drink.</font>

524
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:24,307
<font color="yellow">I'm really not.</font>

525
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:25,953
<font color="yellow">Have some integrity.</font>

526
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:27,760
<font color="yellow">It's not that I can't drink.</font>

527
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,977
<font color="yellow">Where are you going now?
You're acting strange lately.</font>

528
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,736
<font color="yellow">Are you meeting someone secretly?</font>

529
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:36,127
<font color="yellow">I'm going to buy cigarettes.</font>

530
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:38,298
<font color="yellow">I can't find a girlfriend
with you guys around.</font>

531
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:42,597
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

532
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:48,129
<font color="yellow">I didn't know he would
end up dying there.</font>

533
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:58,365
<font color="yellow">Sang Shik.</font>

534
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:11,446
<font color="yellow">I went looking for Im Hyung Soon,
but he had fled to The Philippines.</font>

535
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:15,033
<font color="yellow">If I had pursued it any further</font>

536
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:19,006
<font color="yellow">I thought something might happen to me,
so I quit my job too.</font>

537
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:24,325
<font color="yellow">My life was ruined because
of that Na Jae Hyun case.</font>

538
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:58,053
<font color="yellow">Let's focus on finding Na Jae Hyun.</font>

539
00:46:59,213 --> 00:47:00,990
<font color="yellow">About what happened to Detective Kim...</font>

540
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,890
<font color="yellow">I know it's hard but Hyun Woo...</font>

541
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:04,953
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

542
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:08,544
<font color="yellow">I won't do anything to hurt him.</font>

543
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:13,343
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

544
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,883
<font color="yellow">what should we do first?</font>

545
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:25,649
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun went missing</font>

546
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:28,423
<font color="yellow">or went into hiding
after he met Ham Tae Young.</font>

547
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,412
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young then died in an accident.</font>

548
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:33,760
<font color="yellow">I don't think he's in hiding.</font>

549
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,385
<font color="yellow">If he went into hiding on his own,
he would contact Na Soo Hyun somehow.</font>

550
00:47:38,385 --> 00:47:43,178
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun put this entire thing into
motion in order to find Na Jae Hyun.</font>

551
00:47:44,432 --> 00:47:49,095
<font color="yellow">Detective Ko stopped looking for
Na Jae Hyun because of orders.</font>

552
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:52,988
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul said there
was someone backing him.</font>

553
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:54,176
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

554
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:58,151
<font color="yellow">Something is off.</font>

555
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:04,080
<font color="yellow">The storage unit in the first mission,
Jo Nam Chul, and even Im Hyung Soon.</font>

556
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,450
<font color="yellow">All of these cases
are supposed to be connected.</font>

557
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,410
<font color="yellow">And someone is behind it.</font>

558
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:14,540
<font color="yellow">Why would Na Soo Hyun murder Jo Nam Chul?</font>

559
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,481
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul was going to
reveal who was behind it.</font>

560
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,952
<font color="yellow">What if Jo Nam Chul did kill Na Soo Hyun?</font>

561
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:32,879
<font color="yellow">And Na Soo Hyun killed Jo Nam Chul
to get revenge for his brother?</font>

562
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,979
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun already knows everything.</font>

563
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:41,301
<font color="yellow">He didn't want Jo Nam Chul to
get away with it, unpunished.</font>

564
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,542
<font color="yellow">Because he knew Jo Nam Chul
was the one who killed his brother.</font>

565
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:48,231
<font color="yellow">Perhaps...</font>

566
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,725
<font color="yellow">he wanted us to reveal
his brother's death</font>

567
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:54,060
<font color="yellow">and the fact that it's still a cold case.</font>

568
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,218
<font color="yellow">Then when he says to
put his brother on the show</font>

569
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,419
<font color="yellow">he did not mean to
bring Na Jae Hyun in alive.</font>

570
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,437
<font color="yellow">I had forgotten something.</font>

571
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,392
<font color="yellow">The body that Park Gwang Hyung
had hidden for Jo Nam Chul.</font>

572
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,810
<font color="yellow">We did go in together seven years ago.</font>

573
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:15,879
<font color="yellow">He said he a favor to ask of me.</font>

574
00:49:16,528 --> 00:49:18,649
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to get rid
of a body for him.</font>

575
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:21,517
<font color="yellow">A body?</font>

576
00:49:21,517 --> 00:49:24,870
<font color="yellow">It was hidden at a deserted
airport in Incheon.</font>

577
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,468
<font color="yellow">He wasn't able to finish
the job before coming in.</font>

578
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:32,647
<font color="yellow">He said the person who hired him
to do the job would throw a fit.</font>

579
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:34,620
<font color="yellow">Was it Jo Nam Chul
who killed that person?</font>

580
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,127
<font color="yellow">I don't know and I didn't ask.</font>

581
00:49:49,597 --> 00:49:51,649
<font color="yellow">That body Jo Nam Chul asked you to hide</font>

582
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,086
<font color="yellow">where did you bury it?</font>

583
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:58,082
<font color="yellow">Gosh, go.</font>

584
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,251
<font color="yellow">My big mouth is a problem.</font>

585
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:09,522
<font color="yellow">I trusted you and told you that.</font>

586
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:15,372
<font color="yellow">I only told you because
you saved my life that one time.</font>

587
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:18,611
<font color="yellow">This time I will owe you one
and I'll let you off next time.</font>

588
00:50:19,323 --> 00:50:20,560
<font color="yellow">Just tell me where.</font>

589
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:23,153
<font color="yellow">Where is that body?</font>

590
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,158
<font color="yellow">Stop airing the show!</font>

591
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:27,957
<font color="yellow">Stop, stop!</font>

592
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:29,339
<font color="yellow">Stop airing the show!</font>

593
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,169
<font color="yellow">Stop, stop!</font>

594
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:32,818
<font color="yellow">Stop airing the show!</font>

595
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:34,627
<font color="yellow">Stop, stop!</font>

596
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:39,408
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

597
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,879
<font color="yellow">The body that the gangster boss buried
is probably just skeletal remains.</font>

598
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:46,180
<font color="yellow">There is no way to tell if it's
Na Jae Hyun or not on today's show.</font>

599
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:50,265
<font color="yellow">We have no other way anyhow.</font>

600
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,877
<font color="yellow">You only need to think
about two things for today.</font>

601
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:04,890
<font color="yellow">Make the public sympathetic
to Hyun Woo.</font>

602
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:09,330
<font color="yellow">Also, make it as exciting
and suspenseful as a movie.</font>

603
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,461
<font color="yellow">You just need to remember
one thing, Dong Wook.</font>

604
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:14,745
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo's safety.</font>

605
00:51:18,879 --> 00:51:20,048
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon.</font>

606
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:22,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

607
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,928
<font color="yellow">The Executive Director has a cameraman
and is with the police.</font>

608
00:51:25,928 --> 00:51:28,716
<font color="yellow">Keep in touch with him constantly
and time it perfectly.</font>

609
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:31,591
<font color="yellow">Uh... okay.</font>

610
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,896
<font color="yellow">I'll send the video if
we find him in time</font>

611
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:42,819
<font color="yellow">so you need to time it just right.</font>

612
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:44,519
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that Hyun Woo's safety</font>

613
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,220
<font color="yellow">and the mission's success
are the priorities.</font>

614
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

615
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:50,390
<font color="yellow">You have to film this, over here.</font>

616
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:56,080
<font color="yellow">I took out the scene of the detectives
fighting from the script.</font>

617
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,361
<font color="yellow">Confirm that.
The footage has changed too.</font>

618
00:51:58,361 --> 00:51:59,582
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

619
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:01,513
<font color="yellow">Call me when you find something.</font>

620
00:52:07,203 --> 00:52:09,901
<font color="yellow">We're starting now.
Don't forget what we discussed.</font>

621
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:23,678
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

622
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:30,078
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

623
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:34,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</i></font>

624
00:52:46,703 --> 00:52:51,711
<font color="yellow">Before today's show...
I am sure you all saw the preview.</font>

625
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:54,214
<font color="yellow">Last night...</font>

626
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:59,363
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo attempted to escape
and we went to rescue him.</font>

627
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:01,774
<font color="yellow">That is footage from the scene.</font>

628
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,252
<font color="yellow">The moment I finally managed to hold him</font>

629
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:11,021
<font color="yellow">I was tased by the kidnapper
and lost consciousness.</font>

630
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:15,042
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

631
00:53:18,897 --> 00:53:21,602
<font color="yellow">I was unable to protect
my child two times now.</font>

632
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,021
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is only seven years old.</font>

633
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:29,997
<font color="yellow">He was taken again by a person</font>

634
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:33,388
<font color="yellow">who kidnaps and murders
as if it is nothing.</font>

635
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:42,437
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

636
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:48,173
<font color="yellow">Yes, Commissioner.</font>

637
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:51,464
<font color="yellow">I will do as I promised earlier.</font>

638
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:57,832
<font color="yellow"><i>The kidnapper was merely
a young man in his 20s.</i></font>

639
00:54:00,444 --> 00:54:01,593
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun.</font>

640
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:05,453
<font color="yellow">He is Hyun Woo's kidnapper.</font>

641
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:09,194
<font color="yellow">Today, as reported in the news
regarding the murder of Professor Kim.</font>

642
00:54:09,194 --> 00:54:11,622
<font color="yellow">He is the only suspect in his murder
as well as the murder of Jo Nam Chul.</font>

643
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:16,803
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun lost his parents
at an early age.</font>

644
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:21,863
<font color="yellow">He is said to have had a close bond
with his brother and young sister.</font>

645
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:25,354
<font color="yellow">However, his sister died nine years ago.</font>

646
00:54:25,874 --> 00:54:29,772
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago,
his brother went missing.</font>

647
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:34,312
<font color="yellow">Are these the incidents that
altered a young man's life?</font>

648
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:41,245
<font color="yellow">While we investigated Na Soo Hyun,
we received the fifth mission.</font>

649
00:54:51,814 --> 00:54:56,153
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun is Na Soo Hyun's brother
who went missing seven years ago.</font>

650
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:04,345
<font color="yellow">Do you see the ring and bracelet we
retrieved from Jo Nam Chul's locker?</font>

651
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,553
<font color="yellow">J, S, Y.</font>

652
00:55:11,894 --> 00:55:14,472
<font color="yellow">Na Young Hyun, his younger sister
who died nine years ago...</font>

653
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,703
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun, his brother who's been
missing for seven years...</font>

654
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:19,743
<font color="yellow">And Na Soo Hyun.</font>

655
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:29,772
<font color="yellow">We got a statement from the detective who
first investigated the Na Jae Hyun case.</font>

656
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,078
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago...</font>

657
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:35,272
<font color="yellow">Detective Kim was murdered
by Jo Nam Chul</font>

658
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:38,412
<font color="yellow">who was working on an unofficial case.</font>

659
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,800
<font color="yellow">We found out that he was looking
into Na Jae Hyun's disappearance.</font>

660
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:54,272
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

661
00:55:54,941 --> 00:55:57,321
<font color="yellow">What happened to the footage of
Lieutenant Cha and Detective Ko fighting?</font>

662
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,200
<font color="yellow">The script changed too.</font>

663
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,651
<font color="yellow">I changed it.</font>

664
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:02,071
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

665
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:05,401
<font color="yellow">We sold out Lieutenant Cha
enough last time.</font>

666
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:07,691
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do
with Hyun Woo either.</font>

667
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:10,761
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with it even if
you changed the entire feel of the show?</font>

668
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:12,870
<font color="yellow">The continuity would've been better.</font>

669
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,443
<font color="yellow">In my opinion...</font>

670
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:16,443
<font color="yellow">it's not worth putting
someone through pain</font>

671
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:18,388
<font color="yellow">without even getting his permission.</font>

672
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:20,629
<font color="yellow">It's not that important.</font>

673
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:21,877
<font color="yellow">Writer Yeon!</font>

674
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,388
<font color="yellow">Right now, we are following our lead.</font>

675
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,847
<font color="yellow">Our team is investigating
the whereabouts of Na Jae Hyun.</font>

676
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:35,178
<font color="yellow">We have not found Na Jae Hyun yet.</font>

677
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:40,057
<font color="yellow">For the sake of Hyun Woo's safety,
we must find him before this show ends.</font>

678
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:45,267
<font color="yellow">I hope that Na Jae Hyun can safely
make an appearance on our show.</font>

679
00:57:02,524 --> 00:57:05,069
<font color="yellow">- Young Gwan!
- Yes!</font>

680
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:26,428
<font color="yellow">Oh, Lieutenant Cha.</font>

681
00:57:45,406 --> 00:57:47,388
<font color="yellow">Closer, closer.</font>

682
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,457
<font color="yellow"><i>[Na Jae Hyun]</i></font>

683
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:32,504
<font color="yellow">Okay, we found him.</font>

684
00:58:32,504 --> 00:58:34,814
<font color="yellow">Act excited like we just found him.</font>

685
00:58:39,002 --> 00:58:44,156
<font color="yellow">With ten minutes left to go,
they have found Na Jae Hyun.</font>

686
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:02,127
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately...</font>

687
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,580
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun could not come to us alive
and speak to us on his behalf.</font>

688
00:59:09,388 --> 00:59:15,169
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun was seen with my ex-husband,
who died in an accident on July 13, 2009.</font>

689
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:19,189
<font color="yellow">He was last seen getting into his car.</font>

690
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,312
<font color="yellow">Today...</font>

691
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,640
<font color="yellow">his skeletal remains
were found in a mountain.</font>

692
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:04,540
<font color="yellow">Jae Hyun.</font>

693
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:12,714
<font color="yellow">Jae Hyun.</font>

694
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:25,644
<font color="yellow">We have completed the fifth mission.</font>

695
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:28,613
<font color="yellow">In the beginning...</font>

696
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:34,515
<font color="yellow">it seemed as if the culprit was
punishing people who wronged children.</font>

697
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:39,973
<font color="yellow">Now, he is giving us
a complex question to solve.</font>

698
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,894
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun, Na Jae Hyun.</font>

699
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:48,104
<font color="yellow">Detective Kim... and me.</font>

700
01:00:50,425 --> 01:00:52,872
<font color="yellow">Also, my former husband's accident.</font>

701
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:59,602
<font color="yellow">What is behind all of this?</font>

702
01:01:13,439 --> 01:01:14,609
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

703
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:17,229
<font color="yellow">Get me a mic.</font>

704
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:33,370
<font color="yellow">I want to say something
before today's show ends.</font>

705
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,890
<font color="yellow">As Hyun Woo's father and UCN's President,
I have something to say.</font>

706
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,497
<font color="yellow">Camera on President Song.</font>

713
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:26,158
<font color="yellow"><i>Should we start with the director?</i></font>

714
