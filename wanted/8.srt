00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,831
<font color="yellow">Come to my office if you want to talk...</font>

3
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,437
<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 8]</i></font>

4
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,359
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

5
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,419
<font color="yellow">I asked you why you did it.</font>

6
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,527
<font color="yellow">I got an investment offer in return
for agreeing to cancel Wanted.</font>

7
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,875
<font color="yellow">The capital funds are from China.</font>

8
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,666
<font color="yellow">I was guaranteed management rights.</font>

9
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:14,455
<font color="yellow">So, it was all about money?</font>

10
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,059
<font color="yellow">You've been getting everything you want.</font>

11
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:21,145
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's been good up until now.</font>

12
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:22,904
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

13
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:26,643
<font color="yellow">this show will be over in five days.</font>

14
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,205
<font color="yellow">We're already starting to get
criticized over ethical issues.</font>

15
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:33,294
<font color="yellow">We may have lots of legal
issues to deal with too.</font>

16
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,485
<font color="yellow">Is this what you were planning
to do from the start?</font>

17
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:39,725
<font color="yellow">This is the right time to pull out.</font>

18
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:44,436
<font color="yellow">The police had been cooperating with us,
so we didn't have any big problems.</font>

19
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:47,413
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow, the police will officially
announce they're not working with us.</font>

20
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:51,323
<font color="yellow">We are all going to become
suspects in the investigation.</font>

21
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,763
<font color="yellow">We'll have bigger issues to deal with.</font>

22
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,578
<font color="yellow">Don't you care about Hyun Woo at all?</font>

23
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,388
<font color="yellow">Can you even call yourself a human being?</font>

24
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,199
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say that.</font>

25
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,299
<font color="yellow">This was an impossible show
to produce to begin with.</font>

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,220
<font color="yellow">I was the one who made it possible.</font>

27
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,827
<font color="yellow">It's impossible to air this on
another station by tomorrow.</font>

28
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:29,880
<font color="yellow">What about doing an online broadcast?</font>

29
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,501
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

30
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,150
<font color="yellow">How did your talk go?</font>

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,538
<font color="yellow">I can't get through to him at all.</font>

32
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,299
<font color="yellow">He was only planning to get
what he wanted and leave.</font>

33
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,168
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do this show
on UCN no matter what.</font>

34
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,108
<font color="yellow">How will you do that?</font>

35
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,508
<font color="yellow">I'll use his tactics.</font>

36
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,600
<font color="yellow">I'll have to find his weakness.</font>

37
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,019
<font color="yellow">I'll threaten him
or persuade him somehow.</font>

38
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,586
<font color="yellow">Will that work?</font>

39
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,377
<font color="yellow">He's all about profit and loss.</font>

40
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:11,049
<font color="yellow">If I try to take away what he
doesn't want to lose the most</font>

41
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,418
<font color="yellow">it will be possible.</font>

42
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,192
<font color="yellow">The thing he doesn't want to lose...</font>

43
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,264
<font color="yellow">That would be this station.</font>

44
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,455
<font color="yellow">You should be responsible
for the lawsuit.</font>

45
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,955
<font color="yellow">I had it set up with the legal team
from the very beginning.</font>

46
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,967
<font color="yellow">I made it look like you set up
an external company and produced it.</font>

47
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,080
<font color="yellow">The company has not
breached any contracts.</font>

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,412
<font color="yellow">Therefore, you are responsible
for all the penalties.</font>

49
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:47,311
<font color="yellow">You could be charged for embezzlement
and breach of contract.</font>

50
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,619
<font color="yellow">Does he have a weakness like that?</font>

51
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,371
<font color="yellow">He is willing to do anything
to make money.</font>

52
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,912
<font color="yellow">I have to find something.</font>

53
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,734
<font color="yellow"><i>This customer is
unavailable at the moment.</i></font>

54
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,710
<font color="yellow"><i>Please try again.</i></font>

55
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,568
<font color="yellow"><i>This customer is
unavailable at the moment.</i></font>

56
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:22,525
<font color="yellow"><i>Kyung Hoon, where are you?</i></font>

57
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,061
<font color="yellow"><i>You saw the show last night, right?</i></font>

58
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,650
<font color="yellow"><i>I need your help.</i></font>

59
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,407
<font color="yellow"><i>It's something only you can do.</i></font>

60
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,962
<font color="yellow"><i>Contact me as soon as possible.</i></font>

61
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,821
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

62
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,852
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

63
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,924
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at you, Hyun Woo.</font>

64
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:59,638
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt at all?
Are you in pain?</font>

65
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,922
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we try to make
a deal with the kidnapper?</font>

66
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,458
<font color="yellow">We have no way of contacting him.</font>

67
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,837
<font color="yellow">UCN would never let us do
a preview or a special episode.</font>

68
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,967
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the kidnapper saw the episode.
I'm worried about Hyun Woo.</font>

69
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,328
<font color="yellow">Who knows what he will do?</font>

70
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,386
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

71
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:52,042
<font color="yellow">We were told to use
this room starting today.</font>

72
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,768
<font color="yellow">Our team is using this room.</font>

73
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:56,025
<font color="yellow">Wanted is over now.</font>

74
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,489
<font color="yellow">You can't just come in here like this.</font>

75
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,080
<font color="yellow">We're just doing what we were told.</font>

76
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,727
<font color="yellow">I told them to do it.</font>

77
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:11,051
<font color="yellow">We need time to prepare if
we're going to make a new show.</font>

78
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,482
<font color="yellow">We need to work with new investors.</font>

79
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:25,251
<font color="yellow">Now that they announced
the show is over</font>

80
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,215
<font color="yellow">the culprit might make a move.</font>

81
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:32,609
<font color="yellow">I know he's not his biological son,
but how could he make such a bold move?</font>

82
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,066
<font color="yellow">It might be a good thing.</font>

83
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:36,563
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper wouldn't be so rash
and kill Hyun Woo.</font>

84
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:39,886
<font color="yellow">He has an end goal.
He planned things out in great detail.</font>

85
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:43,388
<font color="yellow">How is that new team?
Are you joining them right away?</font>

86
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:47,994
<font color="yellow">Yes, we are trying to find something
before the show's air time tomorrow.</font>

87
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:53,364
<font color="yellow">But, it feels like they've
given up on the kid.</font>

88
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:56,196
<font color="yellow">Chief, are you okay?</font>

89
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,465
<font color="yellow">Huh? Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

90
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,955
<font color="yellow">I'm not even suspended.
It's only a pay cut for three months.</font>

91
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:04,965
<font color="yellow">They went easy on me.
I'm perfectly fine. It's no big deal.</font>

92
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,037
<font color="yellow">They ought to find the kid though.</font>

93
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,821
<font color="yellow">You really are heroic.</font>

94
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,172
<font color="yellow">Chief, I have a favor to ask.</font>

95
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,609
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

96
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:16,003
<font color="yellow">Keep Cha Seung In out of our way.</font>

97
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:18,547
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say,
you can tell me directly.</font>

98
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:22,588
<font color="yellow">If you're out of this case,
then stay out of it completely.</font>

99
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,545
<font color="yellow">Sure. Don't worry about me.</font>

100
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,152
<font color="yellow">I see you're not going to listen
to me whatsoever.</font>

101
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:30,853
<font color="yellow">Where is Senior Mi Ock?</font>

102
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,133
<font color="yellow">Oh Mi Ock?</font>

103
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,700
<font color="yellow">I'll be keeping an eye on her
to make sure she's not around.</font>

104
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,166
<font color="yellow">She could be punished
for abusing her position</font>

105
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,629
<font color="yellow">when she's supposed to off.</font>

106
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,494
<font color="yellow">Tell her to stay out of it too.</font>

107
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,463
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of things here.</font>

108
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,691
<font color="yellow">Don't concern yourself with it.</font>

109
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,955
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! That's enough.</font>

110
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,110
<font color="yellow">Mi Ock's over there.</font>

111
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,195
<font color="yellow">We'll wait outside.</font>

112
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,691
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Empty out the room.</font>

113
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,292
<font color="yellow">What is this? Who are you!</font>

114
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,301
<font color="yellow">You weren't bad on the show earlier.</font>

115
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,037
<font color="yellow">You wanted to apologize
for the disturbance</font>

116
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,723
<font color="yellow">caused while searching for your son.</font>

117
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,617
<font color="yellow">You will no longer acquiesce
to the demands of the kidnapper.</font>

118
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:28,412
<font color="yellow">It was great.
A leader of the people.</font>

119
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,469
<font color="yellow">Very cool, right?</font>

120
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,311
<font color="yellow">Stop spouting nonsense and leave.</font>

121
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,526
<font color="yellow">However, the truth is that
you got a large investment</font>

122
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,739
<font color="yellow">and you're catering to them.</font>

123
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,897
<font color="yellow">You put your son's life on the line
in exchange for that investment.</font>

124
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,609
<font color="yellow">Was that possibly because
he's not really your son?</font>

125
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,667
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- You started this for money.</font>

126
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,638
<font color="yellow">Now, the money might stop flowing.
It's the perfect time to end it.</font>

127
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:50,031
<font color="yellow">You're the pathetic father
who doesn't care for his son.</font>

128
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:54,229
<font color="yellow">You're the perfect character for people
to latch onto and rip to shreds.</font>

129
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:57,738
<font color="yellow">Whether they're fans of the show or not,
there's something to criticize you about.</font>

130
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:58,853
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

131
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:03,830
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have
chased this story for nothing.</font>

132
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,690
<font color="yellow">I better write this up
as a special report.</font>

133
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:12,258
<font color="yellow">If you don't want that,
why don't you give them a chance?</font>

134
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,829
<font color="yellow">They started this show to save a child.</font>

135
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,565
<font color="yellow">Even if they have to give up,
shouldn't they fight until the end?</font>

136
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:21,599
<font color="yellow">That would be a better story
for me to write too.</font>

137
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,795
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't a better story
be if they kept fighting</font>

138
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,758
<font color="yellow">when no one would give them a chance?</font>

139
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,657
<font color="yellow">Empty this room by noon tomorrow.</font>

140
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:42,286
<font color="yellow">I'm most worried about Hyun Woo
being with Na Soo Hyun.</font>

141
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,547
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

142
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:47,816
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul had Na Jae Hyun and
Ham Tae Young's belongings.</font>

143
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:52,575
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul asked Park Gwang Hyung
to bury the body for him.</font>

144
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:55,088
<font color="yellow">That makes it very likely that
Jo Nam Chul killed Na Jae Hyun.</font>

145
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,263
<font color="yellow">- But...
- But, what?</font>

146
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:04,485
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun's identity was revealed
with five episodes left to go.</font>

147
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:07,258
<font color="yellow">Revenge for his brother
was not the final mission.</font>

148
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:10,907
<font color="yellow">He may have taken part in this
to get revenge for his brother.</font>

149
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,757
<font color="yellow">I think he's an accomplice.</font>

150
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:15,728
<font color="yellow">If there is another culprit</font>

151
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:17,686
<font color="yellow">this has been planned
out in great detail.</font>

152
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:23,093
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a plan made
to punish Jo Nam Chul.</font>

153
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,412
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

154
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:29,931
<font color="yellow">But, Jo Nam Chul was not arrested
and managed to escape.</font>

155
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,445
<font color="yellow">I think that's when
the plan started to go awry.</font>

156
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:36,864
<font color="yellow"><i>He came to the broadcast station
and killed Jo Nam Chul.</i></font>

157
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,032
<font color="yellow"><i>His face ended up being revealed.</i></font>

158
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,239
<font color="yellow"><i>Sing that song for your mom.</i></font>

159
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,475
<font color="yellow"><i>He no longer disguised his voice.</i></font>

160
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:47,047
<font color="yellow"><i>Losing Hyun Woo was a mistake.</i></font>

161
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:52,973
<font color="yellow">To Jung Hye In, he acted as if he was
giving proof of Hyun Woo being alive.</font>

162
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,691
<font color="yellow">He was able to scare her.</font>

163
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,762
<font color="yellow">But, it was a real crisis
for Na Soo Hyun.</font>

164
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,324
<font color="yellow">You're saying he made a mistake,
but pretended it was on purpose?</font>

165
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:04,013
<font color="yellow">- What's your basis for this?
- The previous mission.</font>

166
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:06,253
<font color="yellow">He wasn't telling her to expose</font>

167
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,021
<font color="yellow">that her ex-husband's death
wasn't an accident.</font>

168
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,561
<font color="yellow">The mission was to find out how he died.</font>

169
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:14,172
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In didn't complete her mission.</font>

170
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:19,223
<font color="yellow">But, he wanted to make it seem like
he lost Hyun Woo on purpose.</font>

171
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:23,705
<font color="yellow">He told her she succeeded
without any conditions or questions.</font>

172
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,287
<font color="yellow">His plan keeps coming apart.</font>

173
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:31,936
<font color="yellow">Just like how he put that note on my car,
he's risking being exposed.</font>

174
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,359
<font color="yellow">Today, he confirmed
the body of his brother.</font>

175
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,527
<font color="yellow">If the show can't continue,
we don't know what he'll do next.</font>

176
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,628
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Where?</font>

177
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,888
<font color="yellow">He will contact Jung Hye In somehow.</font>

178
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,061
<font color="yellow">He may do something impulsive
to get the show back on air.</font>

179
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:10,951
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

180
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:13,556
<font color="yellow"><i>Hye In. It's me, Kyung Hoon.</i></font>

181
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,012
<font color="yellow">Yes, Kyung Hoon.</font>

182
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,243
<font color="yellow">Can you come home now?</font>

183
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:20,634
<font color="yellow">I saw the hidden camera in the office.</font>

184
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:24,071
<font color="yellow">I need the video file for that.</font>

185
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,648
<font color="yellow"><i>No, I won't go home.</i></font>

186
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:29,994
<font color="yellow"><i>What if the police are there?</i></font>

187
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:35,523
<font color="yellow"><i>Hye In, you tricked me
last time too.</i></font>

188
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,032
<font color="yellow"><i>Come to a place
that I choose by yourself.</i></font>

189
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:42,224
<font color="yellow"><i>That is, if you want the files.</i></font>

190
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,028
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

191
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,739
<font color="yellow">You have to be quiet.</font>

192
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,600
<font color="yellow">Do you have it?</font>

193
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,071
<font color="yellow">Hye In... you must not care
about how I've been doing.</font>

194
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,912
<font color="yellow">I don't have the time for this.</font>

195
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,113
<font color="yellow">You're just trying to use me.</font>

196
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,984
<font color="yellow">You said you'd find Hyun Woo for me.</font>

197
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,027
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is in so much danger.</font>

198
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:19,845
<font color="yellow">If you keep asking questions like this,
how can I trust in you?</font>

199
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:27,628
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

200
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,055
<font color="yellow">I put a camera in President Song's
office because...</font>

201
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,249
<font color="yellow">You don't need to explain.</font>

202
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,464
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again.</font>

203
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,714
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

204
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,960
<font color="yellow">Kwon Kyung Hoon!</font>

205
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:17,526
<font color="yellow"><i>[Sixth Mission]</i></font>

206
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:18,985
<font color="yellow"><i>[What is President Song's
relationship with to this woman?]</i></font>

207
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,985
<font color="yellow"><i>[Get him on the show
to explain it himself.]</i></font>

208
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:30,816
<font color="yellow">Some man asked me to deliver it to you.</font>

209
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:34,178
<font color="yellow">I thought it was for a special event.</font>

210
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,337
<font color="yellow">Was it him?</font>

211
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:41,146
<font color="yellow">He wearing a hat and mask,
so I can't be too certain.</font>

212
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,146
<font color="yellow">I think that's him.
The eyes are similar.</font>

213
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,215
<font color="yellow">He asked you to give an envelope to
Jung Hye In and you weren't suspicious?</font>

214
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,465
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch TV?</font>

215
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:55,156
<font color="yellow">Ah! I watch that show. It's really fun.</font>

216
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:01,765
<font color="yellow">When I watch it on TV,
it's hard to realize that it's real.</font>

217
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,391
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

218
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:07,495
<font color="yellow">He went up those stairs.
It's been about 10 minutes.</font>

219
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:09,598
<font color="yellow">There won't be any point
going out there now.</font>

220
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:13,795
<font color="yellow">Wow, aren't you the detective
from the Jo Nam Chul mission?</font>

221
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,494
<font color="yellow">It is you!</font>

222
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:19,512
<font color="yellow">The action from the hostage thing
was really cool.</font>

223
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,483
<font color="yellow">We should go.</font>

224
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:46,887
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything in the files
for President Song?</font>

225
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,282
<font color="yellow">There really isn't much.</font>

226
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,718
<font color="yellow">It's just him talking in his study,
room, and company office.</font>

227
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,734
<font color="yellow">He asks to meet in person
for important things.</font>

228
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,734
<font color="yellow">They only have regular conversations.</font>

229
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:01,852
<font color="yellow">I suppose you wouldn't understand
the nuance of their conversations.</font>

230
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,528
<font color="yellow">Don't miss anything, report everything,
and bring it to me quickly.</font>

231
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,554
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

232
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,304
<font color="yellow">Will this really work?</font>

233
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:20,774
<font color="yellow">Everything we've got so far is something
he can get out of with legal help.</font>

234
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,551
<font color="yellow">I just need the station
to back off for five days.</font>

235
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,077
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

236
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,100
<font color="yellow">You know something, don't you?</font>

237
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,261
<font color="yellow">Joon Gu, when we first started out...</font>

238
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,281
<font color="yellow">I will be the producer.</font>

239
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,071
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with that.</font>

240
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,831
<font color="yellow">Will that be possible?</font>

241
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,244
<font color="yellow">Find someone else for the lawsuit.</font>

242
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,166
<font color="yellow">You're better at seizing
opportunities than I thought.</font>

243
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,465
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

244
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:04,590
<font color="yellow">What was that all about?</font>

245
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,781
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

246
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,232
<font color="yellow">Paper company?</font>

247
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:18,762
<font color="yellow">It will be difficult if they set
it up with the legal team.</font>

248
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,981
<font color="yellow">It will be hard to start
investigating within five days too.</font>

249
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:26,292
<font color="yellow">You know how the law works.</font>

250
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:31,282
<font color="yellow">It often helps the powerful appear right
when they're doing wrong.</font>

251
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,657
<font color="yellow">Still, let's start from there.</font>

252
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,253
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

253
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,810
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it.</font>

254
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:57,509
<font color="yellow">Everything that the culprit is trying to
expose on air comes back to this day.</font>

255
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:03,414
<font color="yellow">On the night of July 12, 2009,
Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young meet.</font>

256
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,946
<font color="yellow">Next day, 3:00 a.m. July 13.</font>

257
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,827
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young dies in a car accident.</font>

258
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:11,356
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun goes missing after that.</font>

259
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,550
<font color="yellow">His skeletal remains were
found yesterday night.</font>

260
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:25,655
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper's motive was definitely
the Na Jae Hyun case.</font>

261
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

262
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:29,878
<font color="yellow">We were told to do the show
when Jo Nam Chul was paroled.</font>

263
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:39,245
<font color="yellow"><i>Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young's items
were found in Jo Nam Chul's storage unit.</i></font>

264
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,137
<font color="yellow"><i>He had that in mind from the beginning.</i></font>

265
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,628
<font color="yellow">If we organize these incidents
in a timeline...</font>

266
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:50,887
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul killed Ham Tae Young
and Na Jae Hyun.</font>

267
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:54,054
<font color="yellow">He buried the body or made
it look like an accident.</font>

268
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,284
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun was discharged
from the army two months later.</font>

269
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:59,395
<font color="yellow">He went to police and filed
a missing person's report.</font>

270
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,525
<font color="yellow">Detective Ko Hyung Joon took the case.</font>

271
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:06,405
<font color="yellow">Around the time that he found out
Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun had met...</font>

272
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:12,355
<font color="yellow">I got an order from the higher-ups
to stop my investigation.</font>

273
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,611
<font color="yellow">That's all I did wrong and...</font>

274
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,292
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any evidence either.</font>

275
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,495
<font color="yellow">Later, I got an call from Im Hyung Soon
who Jo Nam Chul killed recently.</font>

276
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,927
<font color="yellow">He said he had a tip for me.</font>

277
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,175
<font color="yellow">I had already dropped the case
by that point.</font>

278
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,128
<font color="yellow">That detective Kim Sang Shik...</font>

279
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:31,186
<font color="yellow">He was asking a lot of questions.</font>

280
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:34,098
<font color="yellow">I only told him the location where he
could meet Im Hyung Soon.</font>

281
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,509
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul was waiting at the location
that Im Hyun Soon was supposed to be.</font>

282
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,588
<font color="yellow">That's where Senior Sang Shik...</font>

283
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:53,472
<font color="yellow">Sang Shik!</font>

284
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:01,559
<font color="yellow">After that, Im Hyun Soon
ran to The Philippines.</font>

285
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:04,859
<font color="yellow">Three months ago, he returned to Korea.</font>

286
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:10,670
<font color="yellow">You started meeting Park Sae Yong
one month before Hyun Woo was kidnapped.</font>

287
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:17,798
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun started working at the cafe
by UCN two months before the kidnapping.</font>

288
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:22,707
<font color="yellow">When was this entire plan made?</font>

289
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:34,035
<font color="yellow">And, three days before
Hyun Woo was kidnapped...</font>

290
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,099
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong kidnapped Lee Ji Eun.</font>

291
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,058
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

292
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:54,571
<font color="yellow">There's Han Sol's father
from the first mission.</font>

293
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,984
<font color="yellow">Also, the doctor Ha Dong Min
from the second mission.</font>

294
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,639
<font color="yellow">They have no connection to the case
from seven years ago.</font>

295
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:06,468
<font color="yellow">Accomplices Park Sae Yong and Lee Ji Eun.
Also, Han Sol's dad and Ha Dong Min.</font>

296
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,862
<font color="yellow">We need to investigate how
these four are connected</font>

297
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:11,259
<font color="yellow">to what happened seven years ago.</font>

298
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:15,016
<font color="yellow">Is she his mistress?</font>

299
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,487
<font color="yellow">She looks young.</font>

300
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:21,727
<font color="yellow">If he's visiting her place,
it seems kind of...</font>

301
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:27,358
<font color="yellow">Why is the kidnapper
suddenly targeting him?</font>

302
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,398
<font color="yellow">He saw President Song announce
that the show is over.</font>

303
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:34,620
<font color="yellow">The reason that he wants Song Jung Hon
on the show is...</font>

304
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,292
<font color="yellow">There's a reason the kidnapper
initially wanted ten episodes.</font>

305
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,562
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

306
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:41,747
<font color="yellow">But, the show got canceled after five.</font>

307
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,913
<font color="yellow">Isn't he trying to get it started again?</font>

308
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:47,973
<font color="yellow">But, he didn't threaten or anything.
He just sent this mission.</font>

309
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:51,051
<font color="yellow">He wanted us to find Han Sol.</font>

310
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,895
<font color="yellow">That was in order for us to expose
his father who was abusing him.</font>

311
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,724
<font color="yellow">If we look into their relationship...</font>

312
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:03,423
<font color="yellow">we might be able to find a way
to start our show again.</font>

313
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:07,466
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

314
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:11,016
<font color="yellow">I think can find this woman.</font>

315
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:17,985
<font color="yellow">I'll go alone for now.</font>

316
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,413
<font color="yellow">Film it if it's important.</font>

317
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,965
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

318
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:59,205
<font color="yellow">My husband left his keys
locked inside the car.</font>

319
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:03,897
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

320
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,215
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

321
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,701
<font color="yellow">Apartment...</font>

322
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,157
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago?</font>

323
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,811
<font color="yellow">Sae Yong was going through
a hard time back then.</font>

324
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,692
<font color="yellow">Hard time?</font>

325
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,938
<font color="yellow">His father passed away early.</font>

326
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,409
<font color="yellow">I ran a restaurant alone
to raise Sae Yong.</font>

327
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,649
<font color="yellow">I became so ill at that time.</font>

328
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,722
<font color="yellow">Sae Yong was going to school and
working at the same time.</font>

329
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:08,100
<font color="yellow">He was going through a lot.</font>

330
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:14,512
<font color="yellow">Was he acting strange at all
before the incident?</font>

331
00:26:14,512 --> 00:26:16,600
<font color="yellow">It was a year ago.</font>

332
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,317
<font color="yellow">Suddenly, he couldn't sleep at all.</font>

333
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:24,706
<font color="yellow">He would stay in his room all the time
and he said he was making a bomb.</font>

334
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:29,294
<font color="yellow">He ended up with a wound
on his wrist and gave up on it.</font>

335
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:30,616
<font color="yellow">One year ago?</font>

336
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:35,126
<font color="yellow">He didn't tell you why he was making it?</font>

337
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:40,557
<font color="yellow">He said that it was the world's fault
that we were poor and suffering.</font>

338
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,621
<font color="yellow">He was going to use it on bad people.</font>

339
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:47,303
<font color="yellow">But, he was actually
a better son during all that.</font>

340
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,096
<font color="yellow">He wasn't always a bad person.</font>

341
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:53,182
<font color="yellow">He wanted to be a movie director
when he was younger.</font>

342
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:57,821
<font color="yellow">I thought he was always watching movies.
He was so innocent.</font>

343
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,923
<font color="yellow">Can we take a look inside his room?</font>

344
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:11,318
<font color="yellow">I left it untouched.
I couldn't bear to go in.</font>

345
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:50,811
<font color="yellow">Didn't the investigative team go through
everything when he committed suicide?</font>

346
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,601
<font color="yellow">It's not because I don't
want to work or anything.</font>

347
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:30,476
<font color="yellow"><i>[Loadagun]</i></font>

348
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:36,399
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

349
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,511
<font color="yellow">This worked out well.</font>

350
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:50,437
<font color="yellow">I thought the show ended,
but you're all still here.</font>

351
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,303
<font color="yellow">It will make investigating easier.</font>

352
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,676
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

353
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,955
<font color="yellow">We're not here to help you today.</font>

354
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:58,513
<font color="yellow">We're here to investigate
the Wanted team.</font>

355
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:02,792
<font color="yellow">From now on, you are all included
as targets of the investigation.</font>

356
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,631
<font color="yellow">Why would we be targets
of the investigation?</font>

357
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,711
<font color="yellow">The motive is there.</font>

358
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:11,628
<font color="yellow">You have lots to gain from the show.</font>

359
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:15,475
<font color="yellow">All of you have a personal
relationship with Jung Hye In.</font>

360
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,734
<font color="yellow">Some of you were
in a desperate situation.</font>

361
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:25,975
<font color="yellow"><i>We, the police...</i></font>

362
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:30,965
<font color="yellow"><i>want to announce that we will no longer
take part in efforts with UCN</i></font>

363
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:36,946
<font color="yellow"><i>in the kidnapping case of Song Hyun Woo
that has aired for the past five days.</i></font>

364
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:40,337
<font color="yellow"><i>This program has resulted in murder
and kidnapping.</i></font>

365
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:43,396
<font color="yellow">These crimes continue to occur
as the culprit holds everyone hostage.</font>

366
00:29:43,896 --> 00:29:47,385
<font color="yellow">Also, the show is
being broadcast unfiltered.</font>

367
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,750
<font color="yellow">It is adding to the anxiety
and fear of the people.</font>

368
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,600
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper holds no respect for
punishment of crimes or justice.</font>

369
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,086
<font color="yellow"><i>We must fix this distorted view.</i></font>

370
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,435
<font color="yellow"><i>Before anyone imitates this crime,
we must correct this societal issue.</i></font>

371
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:04,138
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to get out of this
with excuses about your show.</font>

372
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:06,751
<font color="yellow">You'll have to cooperate
with our investigation.</font>

373
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,957
<font color="yellow">Director Shin Dong Wook.</font>

374
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,907
<font color="yellow">Should we start with you?</font>

375
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,359
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

376
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,339
<font color="yellow">Executive Director, you can come with me.</font>

377
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,466
<font color="yellow">Executive Director.</font>

378
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:37,731
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

379
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,455
<font color="yellow">It's hidden camera footage that
Jung Hye In's manager took.</font>

380
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:49,743
<font color="yellow">Did her manager give
this to Park Sae Yong?</font>

381
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:55,174
<font color="yellow">The culprit used the footage
that the manager took.</font>

382
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,795
<font color="yellow">I don't know if the manager
is an accomplice.</font>

383
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:00,109
<font color="yellow">He might've shared it
or sold it to Park Sae Yong</font>

384
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,424
<font color="yellow">not knowing what is was for.</font>

385
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:04,112
<font color="yellow">I need to look into it.</font>

386
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,876
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong was Jung Hye In's
stalker after all.</font>

387
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:12,894
<font color="yellow">"Loadagun".</font>

388
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,533
<font color="yellow">That's not her manager's ID.</font>

389
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,352
<font color="yellow">If this is a user ID...</font>

390
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,195
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong could have sent
the videos to this person too.</font>

391
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:28,032
<font color="yellow">If we could find that,
it could be the kidnapper's user ID.</font>

392
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,910
<font color="yellow">We want to find this user ID in
Park Sae Yong's hard drive.</font>

393
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,263
<font color="yellow">What could this be? A user ID?</font>

394
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:40,898
<font color="yellow">We're not positive. It could be.</font>

395
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:44,539
<font color="yellow">There was a chat log
from a foreign country.</font>

396
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,830
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to get the chat record
or who he was talking to.</font>

397
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,830
<font color="yellow">It's a site that protects its
member's privacy.</font>

398
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,982
<font color="yellow">The servers are in Central Europe.</font>

399
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:59,371
<font color="yellow">If it isn't the account owner logging in,
the chat records will disappear.</font>

400
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,781
<font color="yellow">It could take time.</font>

401
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:07,977
<font color="yellow">The show from the day before yesterday,
there was a scene of Jo Nam Chul's death.</font>

402
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,269
<font color="yellow">Who filmed that?</font>

403
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,511
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

404
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:15,208
<font color="yellow">Aren't you close friends with
Executive Director Choi Joon Gu?</font>

405
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:20,477
<font color="yellow">A friend of yours is passed out
at the scene of a murder.</font>

406
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:23,997
<font color="yellow">And you start filming the murdered body.
I really don't understand it.</font>

407
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:26,646
<font color="yellow">I called the ambulance right away.</font>

408
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,876
<font color="yellow">There was nothing I could do
until they arrived.</font>

409
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,477
<font color="yellow">We had to air the fact that
Jo Nam Chul had died.</font>

410
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,216
<font color="yellow">We needed footage for that
and that's why I filmed it.</font>

411
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,167
<font color="yellow">It wasn't that you killed him in order
to put it on your show?</font>

412
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:49,179
<font color="yellow">You were with Jo Nam Chul when he got
murdered, right?</font>

413
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,185
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

414
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:56,032
<font color="yellow">I already heard on that day about how
you lost consciousness that day.</font>

415
00:32:56,388 --> 00:33:01,004
<font color="yellow">While he was attacking you,
wouldn't Jo Nam Chul have time to run?</font>

416
00:33:01,004 --> 00:33:03,715
<font color="yellow">Or he would have time to attack
Na Soo Hyun first.</font>

417
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,385
<font color="yellow">I did not see the situation properly,
so I don't know.</font>

418
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,975
<font color="yellow">What if you and Na Soo Hyun happened
to be co-accomplices?</font>

419
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,888
<font color="yellow">Everything would make perfect sense.</font>

420
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,211
<font color="yellow">You tell Na Soo Hyun where and when.</font>

421
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,001
<font color="yellow">Then you help Na Soo Hyun get in.</font>

422
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:19,734
<font color="yellow">Let's assume you attacked
Jo Nam Chul together.</font>

423
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:22,502
<font color="yellow">I understand your situation, Detective.</font>

424
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,819
<font color="yellow">I really don't know Na Soo Hyun.</font>

425
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,167
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to
kill Jo Nam Chul, do I?</font>

426
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,060
<font color="yellow">May I take a look at your phone?</font>

427
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,637
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

428
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:43,460
<font color="yellow">Director, they're taking our set apart!</font>

429
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,206
<font color="yellow">What the hell.</font>

430
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,232
<font color="yellow">What can I do for you?</font>

431
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:51,574
<font color="yellow">Everything on this show is real.</font>

432
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:57,567
<font color="yellow">We are doing this show at the request of
the person who has kidnapped my son.</font>

433
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,081
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In's Wanted is starting now.</font>

434
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:05,940
<font color="yellow">- Put on President Song from last night.
- Okay.</font>

435
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,185
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>

436
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:11,748
<font color="yellow"><i>Get me a mic.</i></font>

437
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,909
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to say something
before today's show ends. </i></font>

438
00:35:16,757 --> 00:35:22,248
<font color="yellow"><i>As Hyun Woo's father and UCN's
President, I have something to say.</i></font>

439
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:28,897
<font color="yellow"><i>Today will be the last episode
of Jung Hye In's Wanted.</i></font>

440
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:32,447
<font color="yellow"><i>That was UCN's President and my
husband speaking last night.</i></font>

441
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:35,656
<font color="yellow">He is also Song Jung Ho,
Hyun Woo's father.</font>

442
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:40,956
<font color="yellow">On live TV, he announced
that this was the last episode.</font>

443
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:45,578
<font color="yellow">The entire broadcast team,
as well as myself...</font>

444
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:48,514
<font color="yellow">had not expected it at all.</font>

445
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:58,377
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper, Na Soo Hyun,
is currently with Hyun Woo.</font>

446
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:04,605
<font color="yellow">If we do not continue with this show,
Hyun Woo will be in danger.</font>

447
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:08,089
<font color="yellow">The day Hyun Woo was kidnapped...</font>

448
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:11,183
<font color="yellow">President Song Jung Ho told you</font>

449
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,911
<font color="yellow">that you'd have to take
the legal blame for the company.</font>

450
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:15,793
<font color="yellow">That's what he said, right?</font>

451
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:17,634
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

452
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,855
<font color="yellow">But, I already said all of this
when Hyun Woo was kidnapped.</font>

453
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,670
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to say it again?
I don't understand.</font>

454
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,081
<font color="yellow">That was an investigation into your
motive and alibi for Hyun Woo.</font>

455
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:32,031
<font color="yellow">Now, we're investigation this show.</font>

456
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,203
<font color="yellow">It's not just you,
Executive Director Choi.</font>

457
00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:37,563
<font color="yellow">Your entire team will be investigated.</font>

458
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,931
<font color="yellow">Let's take it slowly.</font>

459
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,020
<font color="yellow">I think we'll be talking all night.</font>

460
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:47,165
<font color="yellow">We received confirmation
from Song Jung Ho</font>

461
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,072
<font color="yellow">that this show will not be canceled.</font>

462
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:51,694
<font color="yellow"><i>Many of you are probably thinking.</i></font>

463
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:53,976
<font color="yellow">Because Hyun Woo..."</font>

464
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:59,846
<font color="yellow">"Song Jung Ho isn't his biological son,
that's why he acted like this."</font>

465
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:04,920
<font color="yellow">However, Song Jung Ho
has been a loving father</font>

466
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,225
<font color="yellow">for the past seven years.</font>

467
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:12,605
<font color="yellow"><i>He has been like a strong fence for me.</i></font>

468
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:21,364
<font color="yellow">Is President Song here yet?</font>

469
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:24,226
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon is going to call
when he arrives.</font>

470
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:30,627
<font color="yellow">So, why?</font>

471
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,719
<font color="yellow">This is a live show that
has Hyun Woo's life on the line.</font>

472
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,764
<font color="yellow">So, why try to cancel it
without talking to me about it?</font>

473
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:50,286
<font color="yellow">Unexpectedly, we found out through
the kidnapper's sixth mission.</font>

474
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:54,609
<font color="yellow">We discovered why Song Jung Ho
had no other choice.</font>

475
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,565
<font color="yellow">[What is is Song Jung Ho's
relationship with this woman?]</font>

476
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:08,507
<font color="yellow"><i>[Ten Hours Earlier]</i></font>

477
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,112
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

478
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,998
<font color="yellow">Did you think you'd find
Song Jung Ho in here?</font>

479
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,310
<font color="yellow">What is he to you?</font>

480
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,900
<font color="yellow">A married man buys a woman
an apartment and drops by.</font>

481
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:42,509
<font color="yellow">He gives her living expenses.
Isn't it obvious?</font>

482
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,107
<font color="yellow">Didn't you know everything
before you came?</font>

483
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:59,330
<font color="yellow">This woman, Ms. Kim, is the woman
in the picture sent by the kidnapper.</font>

484
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,031
<font color="yellow">Is she truly my husband's mistress?</font>

485
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,000
<font color="yellow">Is the mission solved?</font>

486
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,735
<font color="yellow">However, while I was
meeting with Ms. Kim</font>

487
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:18,161
<font color="yellow">the show's team was doing
their own research on her.</font>

488
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,279
<font color="yellow">They discovered something odd.</font>

489
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,197
<font color="yellow"><i>[Nine Hours Earlier]</i></font>

490
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,877
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In?</font>

491
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,594
<font color="yellow">There's another paper company</font>

492
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:43,460
<font color="yellow">beside the one mentioned
by Executive Director Choi.</font>

493
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,040
<font color="yellow">It's a movie or drama production company.</font>

494
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,980
<font color="yellow">They've never produced anything and
I don't know what they actually do.</font>

495
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,900
<font color="yellow">On the list of board members,
that woman is there.</font>

496
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,732
<font color="yellow">Kim So Hyun is listed.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

497
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,587
<font color="yellow">There was a paper company created
by President Song Jung Ho.</font>

498
00:39:57,884 --> 00:40:02,393
<font color="yellow">This company had no
actual losses or profits.</font>

499
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:08,833
<font color="yellow">Every month, a set amount of money
was deposited into Ms. Kim's account.</font>

500
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:13,712
<font color="yellow">You should have filmed yourself
finding out that information.</font>

501
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:15,652
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

502
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,168
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be in the show.</font>

503
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,681
<font color="yellow">I'd rather not advertise the fact
I did an illegal act either.</font>

504
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:30,089
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

505
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:33,875
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be in here
when we're on air.</font>

506
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:36,036
<font color="yellow">Just come in for our meetings.</font>

507
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:37,217
<font color="yellow">This is the real thing though.</font>

508
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:40,304
<font color="yellow">You want to exclude me from this
and give me things I don't need?</font>

509
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,286
<font color="yellow">This isn't what we promised.</font>

510
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,165
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the restroom quickly.</font>

511
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,420
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up.
- Sorry.</font>

512
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:01,663
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you're being so stingy.</font>

513
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:04,170
<font color="yellow">I'll leave, okay?</font>

514
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,701
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask.</font>

515
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,471
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

516
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:22,130
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not asking
you to do it for free.</font>

517
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,761
<font color="yellow">What was this paper company used for?</font>

518
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:33,596
<font color="yellow">We looked into a list of all the people
listed as employees of this company.</font>

519
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,859
<font color="yellow">It was surprising.</font>

520
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:41,589
<font color="yellow">Except for Ms. Kim,
they were all connected to one person.</font>

521
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:48,130
<font color="yellow">That person was not
President Song Jung Ho.</font>

522
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,844
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

523
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:54,456
<font color="yellow"><i>[Eight Hours and 30 Minutes Earlier]</i></font>

524
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,353
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, Commissioner.</i></font>

525
00:41:59,002 --> 00:42:00,694
<font color="yellow"><i>I will do as I promised earlier.</i></font>

526
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:05,299
<font color="yellow">This was recorded
before yesterday's show.</font>

527
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,846
<font color="yellow">So, the reason he ended the show
is connected to the commissioner.</font>

528
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:12,467
<font color="yellow">No wonder the police were so helpful,
and then suddenly so unhelpful.</font>

529
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,891
<font color="yellow">The Police Commissioner told him
to shut down the show.</font>

530
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:18,292
<font color="yellow">This girl is connected too.</font>

531
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:22,511
<font color="yellow">This mission is targeting
the Police Commissioner.</font>

532
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,735
<font color="yellow"><i>[Six Hours Earlier]
Everyone connected to the paper company</i></font>

533
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:29,998
<font color="yellow">are all related to the commissioner,
except for Kim So Hyun.</font>

534
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:35,237
<font color="yellow">His nephew, in-law, and cousin.</font>

535
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:37,726
<font color="yellow">There's even a high school friend.</font>

536
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:45,391
<font color="yellow">So, Kim So Hyun is not connected
to President Song.</font>

537
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:50,304
<font color="yellow">Is she having an affair with
the Police Commissioner?</font>

538
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:53,083
<font color="yellow">Isn't the pattern different this time?</font>

539
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:57,632
<font color="yellow">Child abuse, illegal clinical tests,
and murder.</font>

540
00:42:58,313 --> 00:43:02,315
<font color="yellow">Those are very different
from a slush fund and an affair.</font>

541
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:07,743
<font color="yellow">If the commissioner is the target
and not President Song...</font>

542
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:13,013
<font color="yellow">The Police Commissioner must be connected
to what happened seven years ago too.</font>

543
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:21,293
<font color="yellow">He asked President Song to stop the show
and even got him a new investor.</font>

544
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:23,982
<font color="yellow">He must have something he needs to hide.</font>

545
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:29,150
<font color="yellow">Let's look into the commissioner and
Kim So Hyun's connection seven years ago.</font>

546
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:30,913
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

547
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,770
<font color="yellow">You bastard!
How could you do this to me?</font>

548
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:45,980
<font color="yellow">Watch what you're saying to me.</font>

549
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,239
<font color="yellow">You said the show would end!</font>

550
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:51,074
<font color="yellow">That paper company...</font>

551
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:53,625
<font color="yellow">Why are they talking about it?</font>

552
00:43:56,063 --> 00:43:57,174
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

553
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:59,333
<font color="yellow">I have somewhere I need to be.</font>

554
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,589
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

555
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,252
<font color="yellow">Do you want to stay here and watch?</font>

556
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:06,382
<font color="yellow">We should finish our talk.</font>

557
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:15,197
<font color="yellow">This is the person connected to all the
board members of the paper company.</font>

558
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:19,000
<font color="yellow">His nickname is Mister Clean.</font>

559
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,498
<font color="yellow">He is an icon of integrity and honesty.
He is Police Commissioner Lee Tae Kyun.</font>

560
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,429
<font color="yellow">UCN's President Song Jung Ho.</font>

561
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,080
<font color="yellow">Police Commissioner Lee Tae Kyun.</font>

562
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:35,301
<font color="yellow">This young lady, Kim So Hyun.</font>

563
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,679
<font color="yellow">What is the connection
between these three people?</font>

564
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,489
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper had put
one more demand on the mission.</font>

565
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:49,250
<font color="yellow">Song Jung Ho must come on
the show and reveal it himself.</font>

566
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:09,031
<font color="yellow">Song Jung Ho.</font>

567
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:14,942
<font color="yellow">First, tell us what your relationship
with Kim So Hyun is.</font>

568
00:45:16,775 --> 00:45:20,982
<font color="yellow">First... I'd like to make
one thing clear.</font>

569
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:25,014
<font color="yellow">I love my wife.</font>

570
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:28,761
<font color="yellow">I have never betrayed my wife.</font>

571
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,574
<font color="yellow">Earlier, we saw Kim So Hyun
say so herself.</font>

572
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:37,884
<font color="yellow">She implied that you two were
in an illicit relationship.</font>

573
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,572
<font color="yellow">She's young and still in her early 20s.</font>

574
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:44,781
<font color="yellow">She has had many issues growing up,
so she has a rebellious personality.</font>

575
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:49,145
<font color="yellow">I believe she reacts in that way when
people think the worst of her.</font>

576
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:54,493
<font color="yellow">Then what about the apartment
and living expenses?</font>

577
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,139
<font color="yellow">Can you please explain that?</font>

578
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,790
<font color="yellow">As for Kim So Hyun...</font>

579
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:03,777
<font color="yellow">A man that I respect...</font>

580
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,721
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

581
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:11,674
<font color="yellow">A man that I once respected needed
help in hiding a situation.</font>

582
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:13,886
<font color="yellow">She is the child of
an extramarital affair.</font>

583

daughter he didn't know existed.</font>

584
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,659
<font color="yellow">Her mother contacted him
before she died of cancer.</font>

585
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,775
<font color="yellow">The paper company was
made for that purpose.</font>

586
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:30,895
<font color="yellow">It was a favor to him because he
couldn't go public with it.</font>

587
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,505
<font color="yellow">I set it up for him to help
his daughter and her future.</font>

588

<font color="yellow">Who is this person that you respected?</font>

589
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,286
<font color="yellow">You may have guessed already.</font>

590
00:46:49,616 --> 00:46:52,134
<font color="yellow">It is Police Commissioner Lee Tae Kyun.</font>

591
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:57,203
<font color="yellow">You have said that you respect him.</font>

592
00:46:57,552 --> 00:47:03,235
<font color="yellow">You set up an illegal paper company
and you helped take care his daughter.</font>

593
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:07,014
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you say your relationship
was of the business variety?</font>

594

in three minutes.</font>

599

600
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:50,672

601

in front of the camera.</font>

602

- She'll regret it.</font>

603

<font color="yellow">Good program? And what is that?</font>

608
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,636
<font color="yellow">It's okay for Song Jung Ho to go up there
and pretend to be a good guy.</font>

611
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,319

of something she never asked for.</font>

612
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:30,476
<font color="yellow">Now, she's going go up there and
people will point their fingers at her.</font>

613
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:32,616
<font color="yellow">Does she have to stripped bare like that?</font>

614
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:35,915
<font color="yellow">There are people waiting in lines
dying to do that.</font>

I think we should go there.</font>
