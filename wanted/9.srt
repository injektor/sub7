1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,660
<font color="yellow">Everything that the culprit is trying to
expose on air comes back to this day.</font>

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,500
<font color="yellow">On the night of July 12, 2009,
Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young meet.</font>

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,150
<font color="yellow">The next day, 3:00 a.m. July 13.</font>

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,560
<font color="yellow">Ham Tae Young dies in a car accident.</font>

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,630
<font color="yellow">Na Jae Hyun goes missing after that.</font>

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,750
<font color="yellow">His skeletal remains were
found yesterday night.</font>

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,980
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper's motive was
definitely the Na Jae Hyun case.</font>

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,640
<font color="yellow">Jo Nam Chul killed Ham Tae Young
and Na Jae Hyun.</font>

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,290
<font color="yellow">He buried the body,
or made it look like an accident.</font>

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,330
<font color="yellow">Na Soo Hyun was discharged
from the army two months later.</font>

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,760
<font color="yellow">He went to the police
and filed a missing person's report.</font>

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,850
<font color="yellow">Detective Ko Hyung Joon took the case.</font>

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,440
<font color="yellow">And around the time he found out
Ham Tae Young and Na Jae Hyun had met...</font>

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,210
<font color="yellow">I got an order from the higher-ups
to stop my investigation.</font>

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,440
<font color="yellow">That's all I did wrong.</font>

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,290
<font color="yellow">And, three days before
Hyun Woo was kidnapped...</font>

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,440
<font color="yellow">Park Sae Yong kidnapped Lee Ji Eun.</font>

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,760
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,380
<font color="yellow">There's Han Sol's father
from the first mission.</font>

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,030
<font color="yellow">Also, the doctor Ha Dong Min
from the second mission.</font>

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,350
<font color="yellow">They have no connection to
the case from seven years ago.</font>

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,790
<font color="yellow">The commissioner tried to end this show.</font>

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,140
<font color="yellow">And this woman is connected.</font>

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,510
<font color="yellow">That means the commissioner
is the target of this mission.</font>

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,920
<font color="yellow">You said you would end this show!</font>

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,620
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about
the paper company?</font>

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,750
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,060
<font color="yellow">I have somewhere to be right now.</font>

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,880
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,270
<font color="yellow">Do you want to stay here
and watch the show?</font>

31
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,110
<font color="yellow">We should finish our conversation.</font>

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,460
<font color="yellow">He's the one who stopped
the investigation seven years ago.</font>

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,680
<font color="yellow">He's the only one who knows what happened
with Na Jae Hyun and Ham Tae Young.</font>

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,960
<font color="yellow">Everything President Song Jung Ho
said today is a lie.</font>

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,600
<font color="yellow">This girl next to me is not my daughter.</font>

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,230
<font color="yellow">Still, I trusted you as my father.</font>

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,120
<font color="yellow">Do you still have more to say?</font>

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,710
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,330
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

40
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you ruin my life?</font>

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,530
<font color="yellow">And that young child...</font>

42
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,540
<font color="yellow">I didn't do that to your daughter.</font>

43
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,660
<font color="yellow">That was a choice you made.</font>

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,930
<font color="yellow">Put your hands up.</font>

45
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.
This is the President's office at UCN.</font>

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,060
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

47
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,200
<font color="yellow">It was suicide... suicide.</font>

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,920
<font color="yellow">I thought he was going to shoot me.</font>

49
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,520
<font color="yellow">But he shot himself in the head.</font>

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,650
<font color="yellow"><i>[EPISODE 9]</i></font>

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,490
<font color="yellow">The commissioner came into your room</font>

52
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,020
<font color="yellow">about 30 minutes after
the show ended, right?</font>

53
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

54
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,770
<font color="yellow">What did he say to you?</font>

55
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,290
<font color="yellow">He asked me if didn't
I pity his daughter.</font>

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,720
<font color="yellow">He yelled at me about
why I ruined his life.</font>

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,620
<font color="yellow">What next?</font>

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,760
<font color="yellow">He came running at me.</font>

59
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,290
<font color="yellow">He grabbed me by the throat.</font>

60
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,030
<font color="yellow">I told him to stop.</font>

61
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,620
<font color="yellow">I tried to talk to him and send him out.</font>

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,420
<font color="yellow">It's all out in the open now anyway.</font>

63
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,010
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you at least try
to appease your daughter?</font>

64
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,320
<font color="yellow">I had it all prepared for you.</font>

65
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,240
<font color="yellow">Prepared for me?</font>

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,580
<font color="yellow">I said the slush fund was made
just for the sake of your daughter.</font>

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,630
<font color="yellow">I said you did it because you
couldn't protect your daughter.</font>

68
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="yellow">We made up that nice story.</font>

69
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,270
<font color="yellow">Our writer is good at that kind of thing.</font>

70
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly doing this to me?</font>

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,640
<font color="yellow">That was my way of giving you an out.</font>

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,610
<font color="yellow">People in our country, when they
see motherly or fatherly love</font>

73
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,000
<font color="yellow">they will forgive anything</font>

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
<font color="yellow">like corrupt politicians,
bad business deals, stealing.</font>

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,780
<font color="yellow">You should have shown an emotional scene
with your daughter back then.</font>

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,490
<font color="yellow">Who is it!</font>

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,590
<font color="yellow">Who is it that has your back
and exposed me?</font>

78
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,020
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

79
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,330
<font color="yellow">You really don't seem to understand.</font>

80
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,100
<font color="yellow">No one has my back.</font>

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,560
<font color="yellow">I'm the one deciding who to use
and making that choice.</font>

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,270
<font color="yellow">Politics will be difficult
for you from now on.</font>

83
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,610
<font color="yellow">Maybe there's a job for a president
at a public company.</font>

84
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,000
<font color="yellow">I could find out for you.</font>

85
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,050
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,910
<font color="yellow">Let's just talk.</font>

87
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,890
<font color="yellow">Give me a chance to fix this.</font>

88
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,770
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,650
<font color="yellow">To get to where I am...</font>

90
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,150
<font color="yellow">I had to get a little dirty
here and there.</font>

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,190
<font color="yellow">I may have lied and hidden things.</font>

92
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,750
<font color="yellow">But, I have always been patriotic.</font>

93
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,630
<font color="yellow">This country!</font>

94
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,310
<font color="yellow">I believed that I could change
this country for the better.</font>

95
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,720
<font color="yellow">I truly did.</font>

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

97
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,510
<font color="yellow">Saying all these things to me...</font>

98
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,320
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go home for now?</font>

99
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,680
<font color="yellow">Am I cleared of all charges now?</font>

100
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,750
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

101
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,260
<font color="yellow">The police commissioner committed
suicide because of Wanted.</font>

102
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,580
<font color="yellow">President Song was on the scene with him.</font>

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,030
<font color="yellow">He will be investigated as a suspect
until there is clear evidence.</font>

104
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,210
<font color="yellow">Then what about the show?</font>

105
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,460
<font color="yellow">You will hear from us soon.</font>

106
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,200
<font color="yellow">The broadcast team should
all be waiting on standby.</font>

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,620

<font color="yellow">About the commissioner's suicide</font>

125
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,350
<font color="yellow">write the article focusing
on the daughter.</font>

126
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,370
<font color="yellow">Straighten out that slush fund story too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh? You can't order me around
because we're on the same team.</font>

128
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,330
<font color="yellow">Don't you see you're the only reporter?
I'm giving you an exclusive.</font>

129
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,510
<font color="yellow">This isn't an exclusive.
I'm just observing.</font>

130
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,480
<font color="yellow">If you want something,
I have to get something in return.</font>

131
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,890
<font color="yellow">What do you want to know?</font>

132
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,550
<font color="yellow">What was that SG logo after the show?</font>

133
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,440

<font color="yellow">Yes, the show.</font>

140
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,010

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,270
<font color="yellow">Yeon Jung Eun.</font>

152
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,210
<font color="yellow">She insisted on eating when you came.</font>

153
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,260
<font color="yellow">She'll miss the school bus
if she eats now.</font>

154
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, Jung Eun. Did you do that?</font>

155
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,500
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We can eat together
and I'll drive her.</font>

156
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,720
<font color="yellow">Jung Eun, let's take Mom's car
and go to school today.</font>

157
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,090
<font color="yellow">We're supposed to have
your birthday party today.</font>

158
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,670
<font color="yellow">Wow, this seaweed soup looks so good.</font>

159
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,700
<font color="yellow">Grandma made such delicious soup.</font>

160
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,430
<font color="yellow">Here. Open up, Jung Eun.</font>

161
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,810
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

162
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,240
<font color="yellow">Good girl.</font>

163
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,690
<font color="yellow">Is it good?</font>

164
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,760
<font color="yellow">It is good, isn't it?</font>

165
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,740
<font color="yellow">Hi! You must be Jung Eun's friends.</font>

166
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,760
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

167
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,050
<font color="yellow">We're playing the Wanted game.
You should play too.</font>

168
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,880
<font color="yellow">You can be Jung Hye In. I'm a detective.</font>

169
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,790
<font color="yellow">You have to find the culprit.</font>

170
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,020
<font color="yellow"><i>[FIND OUT WHO MURDERED THIS PERSON.]</i></font>

171
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,060
<font color="yellow">Stand up.</font>

172
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,700
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

173
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,000
<font color="yellow">The kidnapper has a fan club.</font>

174
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,420
<font color="yellow">This is the fan club's symbol.
It's a "W" for Wanted.</font>

175
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,110
<font color="yellow">People think Na Soo Hyun is good looking.</font>

176
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,110
<font color="yellow">They like him and pity him
because of his brother and sister.</font>

177
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,820
<font color="yellow">There is a very small group of them.</font>

178
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,140
<font color="yellow">They go around trying punish
the wrongs of society.</font>

179
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,250
<font color="yellow">They kill animals and destroy
local businesses.</font>

180
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,030
<font color="yellow">They've started to leave behind this
symbol and take pictures.</font>

181
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,960
<font color="yellow">Orson Welles.</font>

182
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,730
<font color="yellow">This is the ID that Lee Ji Eun gave us
when she gave us Ha Dong Min's mission.</font>

183
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,890
<font color="yellow"><i>[PARK BO YEON]</i></font>

184
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,150
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

185
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,030
<font color="yellow">I'll head to the office now.</font>

186
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, what is it?</font>

187
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,370
<font color="yellow">Ill be there soon.</font>

188
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,730
<font color="yellow">What in the world?</font>

189
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,210
<font color="yellow">He's alive.</font>

190
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,530
<font color="yellow">Is that the mission?</font>

191
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
<font color="yellow">- That's...
- Isn't he...</font>

192
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,480
<font color="yellow">That is Doctor Ha Dong Min's lawyer.</font>

193
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,880
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min will be transparent
about everything.</font>

194
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,430
<font color="yellow">It's a copycat.</font>

195
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,570
<font color="yellow">We need to call the police.</font>

196
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,690
<font color="yellow">This isn't something
we need to worry about.</font>

197
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,040
<font color="yellow">We don't have the real mission yet.</font>

198
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,580
<font color="yellow">But, how did they know?</font>

199
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,280
<font color="yellow">How did they know Lee Ji Eun's
Coconut TV ID and password?</font>

200
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,660
<font color="yellow">We never told the public.</font>

201
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,850
<font color="yellow">Isn't it possible with hacking?</font>

202
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,440
<font color="yellow">It is possible.</font>

203
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,520
<font color="yellow">I don't think you can all ignore this.</font>

204
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,050
<font color="yellow">If those people really kill that lawyer,
your information was hacked.</font>

205
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,980
<font color="yellow">You provided a motive for a motive
for a crime like that too.</font>

206
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,720
<font color="yellow">The public's sympathy for Hyun Woo
will be completely gone.</font>

207
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,710
<font color="yellow">Apart from the public's sympathy
for Hyun Woo...</font>

208
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,040
<font color="yellow">it is true that we bear some
responsibility for this.</font>

209
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,590
<font color="yellow">Today's show will depend on
how fast we can resolve this.</font>

210
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,720
<font color="yellow">It could completely change the show.</font>

211
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,890
<font color="yellow">Tell the police first and let's think
about what to do next.</font>

212
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,370
<font color="yellow">Anyone that was connected to
the incident seven years ago</font>

213
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,360
<font color="yellow">the culprit has been observing them
and their crimes.</font>

214
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,970
<font color="yellow">We can be sure of that now.</font>

215
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,690
<font color="yellow">The Police Commissioner
committed suicide.</font>

216
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,400
<font color="yellow">Why did Na Jae Hyun
and Ham Tae Young meet?</font>

217
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,810
<font color="yellow">Why can't that reason
be known to the world?</font>

218
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,750
<font color="yellow">Who is trying to hide it?</font>

219
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,150
<font color="yellow">We've lost that chance now.</font>

220
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,370
<font color="yellow">How is it going with
the investigation team?</font>

221
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,700
<font color="yellow">They're putting all their resources
into catching Na Soo Hyun.</font>

222
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,650
<font color="yellow">Detective Park and Yoo believe that</font>

223
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,120
<font color="yellow">the real culprit is within
the broadcast team.</font>

224
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,930
<font color="yellow">Let's continue looking at the motive.</font>

225
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,960
<font color="yellow">Once we figure that out,
we can guess who the next target will be.</font>

226
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,250
<font color="yellow">We can figure out who
has the most to gain in this.</font>

227
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,120
<font color="yellow">Senior, meet with Lee Ji Eun once more.</font>

228
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,330
<font color="yellow">She might cooperate if she hears
about this.</font>

229
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,360
<font color="yellow">Things have gone out of control unlike
what they planned.</font>

230
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,680
<font color="yellow"><i>We'll look at Ha Dong Min.</i></font>

231
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,910
<font color="yellow"><i>And Professor Kim Woo Jin.</i></font>

232
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,580
<font color="yellow">Let's seen what happened
to them seven years ago.</font>

233
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

234
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, Jung Hye In.</font>

235
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,630
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

236
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,690
<font color="yellow">I got the IP.</font>

237
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,820
<font color="yellow">Please let me live.</font>

238
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,980
<font color="yellow">Why are you so bad at this?</font>

239
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,940
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

240
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,060
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

241
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,760
<font color="yellow">I won it all! I won!</font>

242
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,190
<font color="yellow">Let me live...</font>

243
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,090
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

244
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,630
<font color="yellow">I'll give you anything you want.</font>

245
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,230
<font color="yellow">Chief, we're going to
that location they found.</font>

250
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, there is.</i></font>

251
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,500
<font color="yellow">Your music is turned on so loud.
I can't take it anymore. Come out.</font>

255
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,900
<font color="yellow">People's reactions are not very...</font>

256
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,280
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo is no longer
of interest to people.</font>

257
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,040
<font color="yellow">Now, the Police Commissioner
has committed suicide.</font>

258
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,660

kidnapper's intent.</font>

have expected this, Director.</font>

as long as we reach 20 percent.</font>

<font color="yellow">Come on. Really?</font>

262
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,970
<font color="yellow">From what I can tell,
you feel a moral duty to save Hyun Woo.</font>

263
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,650

this show can become.</font>

<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

267
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,780

about him and his daughter?</font>

their youngest son, Ham Tae Young.</font>

272
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,530

who they did not know existed.</font>

274
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,310

from the billionaire family?</font>

276
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,490

278
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,670

break room and get some rest.</font>

279
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,510
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, you should go to
the hospital and get an IV drip.</font>

280
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,130
<font color="yellow">The mission is not here yet.</font>

281
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,000

won't make it come.</font>

282
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,300
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I prefer to be here.</font>

283
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,970
<font color="yellow">Should I go buy some medicine?</font>

284
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,390
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

285
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,630
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

286
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,140
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

287
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,550
<font color="yellow">You should eat something too.</font>

288
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,170
<font color="yellow">Buy something easy to digest for Hye In
and something for yourself.</font>

289
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,660
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

290
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,570
<font color="yellow">You waited on the jogging path
around 6:00 a.m. today.</font>

291
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,110

you kidnapped him.</font>

292
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,840
<font color="yellow">How did you know where he jogged
and what time to be there?</font>

293
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,600
<font color="yellow">He has it connected to his social media.</font>

294
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,570
<font color="yellow">He puts up his jogging route and time.</font>

295
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,660
<font color="yellow">That's where I saw it.</font>

296

<font color="yellow">Your user ID is Magneto.
You're a special level member.</font>

kidnapper's fan club?</font>

298
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,520
<font color="yellow">It was after Ha Dong Min
was on the show.</font>

299
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,780
<font color="yellow">He was using children for test subjects.</font>

300
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,890
<font color="yellow">That bastard! It made me so angry.</font>

301
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,710
<font color="yellow">Because of him,
all those poor kids were dying.</font>

302
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,160
<font color="yellow">So, why didn't you go after Ha Dong Min?</font>

303
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,130
<font color="yellow">Why did you kidnap Ha Dong Min's lawyer?</font>

304
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,830
<font color="yellow">I thought that our master would
want to kill Ha Dong Min himself.</font>

305
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,420
<font color="yellow">Just like when he killed
Professor Kim Woo Jin.</font>

306
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,690
<font color="yellow">That's why I decided to complete it.</font>

307
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,890
<font color="yellow">Master?</font>

308
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,740
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo's kidnapper.</font>

309
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,480
<font color="yellow">That what we call him in our community.</font>

310
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,110
<font color="yellow">Even that police commissioner yesterday.</font>

311
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,850
<font color="yellow">They're all just rotten
and fill their pockets.</font>

312
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,500
<font color="yellow">People like me who are born with nothing</font>

313
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,110
<font color="yellow">we are no better than dogs or pigs
in this "Hell" Joseon.</font>

314
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,270
<font color="yellow">This plan...</font>

315
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,300
<font color="yellow">was it just the two of you?</font>

316
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,700
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

317
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,710
<font color="yellow"><i>So, this is what
an interrogation room is like.</i></font>

318
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,040
<font color="yellow">But, it's not like the movies at all.</font>

319
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,670
<font color="yellow">It's quite lacking. It really is.</font>

320
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,860
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

321
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,450
<font color="yellow">Sit up straight.</font>

322
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,430
<font color="yellow"><i>Is Wanted not filming here?</i></font>

323
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,900
<font color="yellow">We did all of this for our master.</font>

324
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,170
<font color="yellow">We did fail.</font>

325
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,120
<font color="yellow">It would be nice if the show aired
that we tried to do something.</font>

326
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,760
<font color="yellow">Did Hyun Woo's kidnapper
ask you for help?</font>

327
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,460
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh, no.</font>

328
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,750
<font color="yellow">It would've been great if he had.</font>

329
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,210
<font color="yellow">I said to Magneto that we ought to
try using the potassium chloride.</font>

330
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,220
<font color="yellow">He said that would ruin our futures.</font>

331
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,730
<font color="yellow">He just wanted to scare the guy.</font>

332
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,950
<font color="yellow">So, it wasn't the kidnapper.</font>

333
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,220
<font color="yellow">Whose idea was it to do this?</font>

334
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,990
<font color="yellow">The two of just thought
it would be fun, so we did it.</font>

335
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,460
<font color="yellow">We didn't kill him, so it's fine.</font>

336
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,440
<font color="yellow">Soon, my parents will be here
and I'll be released.</font>

337
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,390
<font color="yellow">Before that happens,
can you help me get on the show?</font>

338
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

339
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,600
<font color="yellow">You're a crazy punk.</font>

340
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,620
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she picking up?
She should be back by now.</font>

341
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,320
<font color="yellow">Please let me live.</font>

342
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,620
<font color="yellow">Let me live, let me live, let me live!</font>

343
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,630
<font color="yellow">Please let me live! Please!</font>

344
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

345
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,720
<font color="yellow">Please let me live!</font>

346
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,410
<font color="yellow">Please, please!</font>

347
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,380
<font color="yellow">Please let me live!</font>

348
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,200
<font color="yellow">Let me live!</font>

349
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,260
<font color="yellow">Help me!</font>

350
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,020
<font color="yellow">Please save me!</font>

351
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,040
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

352
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,300
<font color="yellow">"This girl dies or Ha Dong Min dies.
You choose."</font>

353
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,990
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon? What's going on?</font>

354
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,800
<font color="yellow">Save me! Please save me.</font>

355
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,160
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Where are you?</font>

356
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,200
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't know.</i></font>

357
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,890
<font color="yellow">I was buying medicine
and some man grabbed me.</font>

358
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,100
<font color="yellow">I don't remember what happened next.</font>

359
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,460
<font color="yellow">I'm buried underground right now.</font>

361
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:46,690
<font color="yellow">The last thing she saw was the frame
and ceiling of a deserted greenhouse.</font>

362
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,490
<font color="yellow">All local stations are
looking at greenhouses.</font>

363
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,560
<font color="yellow">Look through all the CCTVs
in the vicinity of UCN.</font>

364
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,240
<font color="yellow">Look for any witnesses.</font>

365
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,040
<font color="yellow">Find him no matter what.</font>

366
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,740
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

367
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,100
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to go?</font>

368
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,980
<font color="yellow">Something is off.</font>

369
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,440
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

370
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,950
<font color="yellow">They were caught too easily.</font>

371
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,860
<font color="yellow">The kidnapping of the lawyer.</font>

372
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,630
<font color="yellow">Who told you to do it?</font>

373
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,560
<font color="yellow">I told you it was just our idea.</font>

374
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,870
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

375
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,030
<font color="yellow">You guys are hackers,
yet you allowed your IP to be traced?</font>

376
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,170
<font color="yellow">You managed to kidnap a person and
take him inside without getting caught.</font>

377
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,610
<font color="yellow">You allow yourself to get arrested
as if you were waiting.</font>

378
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,600
<font color="yellow">That was all a part of your plan, right?</font>

379
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,320
<font color="yellow">Tell me now.
Where did you bury her?</font>

380
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,420
<font color="yellow">You must be thinking
you'll be easily released.</font>

381
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,690
<font color="yellow">If we can't catch the guy,
you'll take the fall.</font>

382
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,230
<font color="yellow">If the victim dies...</font>

383
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,090
<font color="yellow">Kidnapping, murder...</font>

384
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,840
<font color="yellow">That's a life sentence.</font>

385
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,130
<font color="yellow">Your friend Capco must be quick.
He already has a lawyer.</font>

386
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,250
<font color="yellow">That lawyer is saying that you
threatened his client to do it all.</font>

387
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,580
<font color="yellow">Will you be okay?</font>

388
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,720
<font color="yellow">Tell us everything now.</font>

389
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,620
<font color="yellow">You will be aiding the investigation,
so we could lighten your sentence.</font>

390
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,810
<font color="yellow">I really don't know where she's buried.</font>

391
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,310
<font color="yellow">He wasn't using one fixed ID.</font>

392
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,300
<font color="yellow">I don't know his name either.</font>

393
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,960
<font color="yellow">We were just chatting
and agreed to do it as a joke.</font>

394
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,510
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know he was
going to bury anyone.</font>

395
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,500
<font color="yellow">He's not talking at all.</font>

396
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,940
<font color="yellow">They definitely planned
on getting caught.</font>

397
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,850
<font color="yellow">Find out who owns
that place they were caught in.</font>

398
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,130
<font color="yellow">Neither of them actually lives them.</font>

399
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,490
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

400
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,490
<font color="yellow"><i>- Are you hurt at all?
- Please help me.</i></font>

00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,770
<font color="yellow">The phone is connected
to a virtual server.</font>

402
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,040
<font color="yellow">We can't track her.</font>

403
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,250
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom.</i></font>

404
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,740

We will come for you.</font>

405
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,070
<font color="yellow">We are looking for you
and we'll find you soon.</font>

406
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,190
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you listening to me?</i></font>

407
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,920

<font color="yellow"><i>Detective!</i></font>

410
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,120
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon. It's me, Detective Park.
You know me, right?</font>

411
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,360
<font color="yellow">The police are working hard to find you.
We will find you soon.</font>

412
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,760
<font color="yellow">You need to hold on.</font>

413
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,400
<font color="yellow">Don't hang up and talk to me.</font>

414
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,770
<font color="yellow">We can't just do nothing.</font>

415
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,260
<font color="yellow">Let the police handle it.</font>

416
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,950
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about what we should do
about the kidnapper's demand.</font>

417
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,690
<font color="yellow">The copycat kidnapper is demanding
that we punish Ha Dong Min.</font>

418
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,840
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min is already in prison.</font>

419
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,760
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min is the only mission
target who has yet to die.</font>

420
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,860
<font color="yellow">They may not be looking for
a legal punishment here.</font>

421
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,890
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min wouldn't even be getting
punished legally within today either.</font>

422
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,290
<font color="yellow">This is a demand telling us to kill him.</font>

423
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,260
<font color="yellow">Didn't you guys know?</font>

424
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,030
<font color="yellow">That lawyer who was kidnapped</font>

425
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,410
<font color="yellow">had requested a review
of the legality of his arrest.</font>

426
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,460
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min was questioned yesterday
and the decision will be made today.</font>

427
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,430
<font color="yellow">That means that the prosecution
hasn't charged him yet.</font>

428
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,720
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

429
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,940
<font color="yellow">Even if they charge him,
he will apply for bail.</font>

430
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,590
<font color="yellow">That will just give him more time.</font>

431
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,600
<font color="yellow">It's not as if he will go to
court today and get sentenced.</font>

432
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,740
<font color="yellow">In order for him to get punished today
like the copycat demands...</font>

433
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,610
<font color="yellow">death is the only way.</font>

434
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,010
<font color="yellow">Let's get Ha Dong Min out of jail
and make a deal.</font>

435
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,200
<font color="yellow">We should make a preview.</font>

436
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,970
<font color="yellow">How will you do it?</font>

437
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,560
<font color="yellow">We need to send a message
to the copycat kidnapper.</font>

438
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,650
<font color="yellow">Let's trade Ha Dong Min for Bo Yeon.</font>

439
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,350
<font color="yellow">We'll pretend to listen to his demands.</font>

440
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,060
<font color="yellow">After that, the police
will have to take over.</font>

441
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,060
<font color="yellow">I signed a two year lease
for my son to live here.</font>

442
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,350
<font color="yellow">He had to leave the
country very suddenly.</font>

443
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,510
<font color="yellow">I rented it out on the internet.</font>

444
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,810
<font color="yellow">Did you check his identification?</font>

445
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,380
<font color="yellow">Or did you get payment
through a bank account?</font>

446
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,360
<font color="yellow">We met in person and
he paid six months' rent in cash.</font>

447
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,180
<font color="yellow">I got two months rent as a deposit.</font>

448
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,950
<font color="yellow">He looks very normal.</font>

449
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,960
<font color="yellow">He sure decorated the place strangely.</font>

450
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,870
<font color="yellow">He's not that young.</font>

451
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,520
<font color="yellow">They tape over everything
every three days.</font>

452
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,280
<font color="yellow">I don't think we have
anything from that spot.</font>

453
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,170
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen that young man
for about a week either.</font>

454
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,730
<font color="yellow">How long can Bo Yeon last?</font>

455
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,180
<font color="yellow">She's in a box in the ground.</font>

456
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,700
<font color="yellow">If she's not getting oxygen,
she'll have about an hour.</font>

457
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,470
<font color="yellow">We still don't have a mission.</font>

458
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,620
<font color="yellow">I don't know how he'll react
if he finds out about this situation.</font>

459
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,360
<font color="yellow">We only have four more left.</font>

460
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,060
<font color="yellow">If ten episodes is his goal,
today's show will be important to him.</font>

461
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,600
<font color="yellow">He'll need to keep this show going.</font>

462
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,250
<font color="yellow">I don't know if he'll change his plans
or just push things forward.</font>

463
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,460
<font color="yellow">We'll send out the preview.</font>

464
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,590
<font color="yellow">Whether it's Bo Yeon's kidnapper or
Hyun Woo's, we'll get a reaction.</font>

465
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,590
<font color="yellow">Let's make a decision after.</font>

466
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,390
<font color="yellow">Seeing as he hasn't sent a mission yet,
he might already know everything.</font>

467
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,110
<font color="yellow">I'll do what I can do
to get Ha Dong Min out.</font>

468
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,280
<font color="yellow">Do you have a way?</font>

469
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,200
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

470
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,790
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

471
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,610
<font color="yellow">Dad! Please come save me.</font>

472
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,540
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

473
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,550
<font color="yellow">Come save me, please.</font>

474
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,010
<font color="yellow">All right, we'll call you right away.</font>

475
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,100
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

476
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,180
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha Seung In called.</font>

477
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,440
<font color="yellow">He thinks the people who kidnapped
Ha Dong Min's lawyers are conspirators.</font>

478
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,760
<font color="yellow">Then this could be
those fan club members?</font>

479
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,090
<font color="yellow">The police have a list of the members
that Bo Yeon found.</font>

480
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,390
<font color="yellow">They've started investigating
the chat rooms and comments.</font>

481
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,860
<font color="yellow">Isn't there anything that we can do?</font>

482
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,690
<font color="yellow">We have to fool her kidnapper
and save Bo Yeon.</font>

483
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,960
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo's kidnapper knew everything
about Jung Hye In and the station.</font>

484
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,730
<font color="yellow">The people who kidnapped Bo Yeon
are just copycats.</font>

485
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,970
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

486
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,310
<font color="yellow">They kidnapped Park Bo Yeon
to copy the Wanted kidnapper.</font>

487
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,350
<font color="yellow">Burying someone alive has
been in a lot of movies.</font>

488
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,090
<font color="yellow">Like that movie "Buried."</font>

489
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,410
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the group
tried to plan it in detail.</font>

490
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,110
<font color="yellow">If it was a fan club
that was doing this...</font>

491
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,010
<font color="yellow">everything can't be controlled
and known by her kidnapper.</font>

492
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,160
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

493
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,850
<font color="yellow">I made a preview with a corpse
that looked like Ha Dong Min?</font>

494
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,800
<font color="yellow">Let's give it a try.</font>

495
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,300
<font color="yellow">We have to a proper job.
It could put Bo Yeon in more danger.</font>

496
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,390
<font color="yellow">We have to discuss this with the police
and even let Ha Dong Min's people know.</font>

497
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,350
<font color="yellow">Young Gwan.</font>

498
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,440
<font color="yellow">I've never seen this fish before.</font>

499
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,810
<font color="yellow">Do you think this can
lead us to something?</font>

500
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,620
<font color="yellow">I think it's some kind of ancient fish,
though I don't know exactly which one.</font>

501
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,870
<font color="yellow">An ancient type of fish?</font>

502
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,330
<font color="yellow">I was kind of interested in
rare creatures when I was in school.</font>

503
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,570
<font color="yellow">It won't be hard to find
which stores sell this.</font>

504
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,230
<font color="yellow">There are a few internet stores
that sell them too.</font>

505
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,890
<font color="yellow">Let's get a list of businesses
that sell this fish.</font>

506
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,030
<font color="yellow">Then find out if they
delivered to this address.</font>

507
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

508
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, this was one of ours.</font>

509
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,590
<font color="yellow">We had them two months ago.</font>

510
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,690
<font color="yellow">Did you deliver it to this address?</font>

511
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,290
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

512
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,830
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right. I sent it here.</font>

513
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,160
<font color="yellow">Is he a registered member?</font>

514
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,470
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's a regular customer.</font>

515
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,330
<font color="yellow">Can we have his information?</font>

516
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,810
<font color="yellow">Is this Moon Sung Hyuk?</font>

517
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,680
<font color="yellow">I'm getting tired.</font>

518
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,530
<font color="yellow">My parents...</font>

519
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,670
<font color="yellow">Have they heard the news?</font>

520
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,580
<font color="yellow">Do they know?</font>

521
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,090
<font color="yellow">Of course, we contacted
your mother and father.</font>

522
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,770
<font color="yellow">They're at the police station.</font>

523
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,790
<font color="yellow">They're getting all the updates.</font>

524
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,490
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to hear my mom's voice.</i></font>

525
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,150
<font color="yellow"><i>- My mom.
- Bo Yeon!</i></font>

526
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,870
<font color="yellow">We will save you.</font>

527
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,180
<font color="yellow"><i>- Mom...
- We'll do whatever it takes to save you.</i></font>

528
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,430
<font color="yellow">You have to hold on, okay?</font>

529
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,140
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, stay strong!</font>

530
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,630
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

531
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,320
<font color="yellow"><i>Stay focused!</i></font>

532
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,750
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

533
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,840
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll get your mom.</font>

534
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,200
<font color="yellow">I'll go get your mom.</font>

535
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,820
<font color="yellow"><i>[WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED
THE SEVENTH MISSION YET!]</i></font>

00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

539
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,260
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

540
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,330
<font color="yellow">The preview will air
during every commercial.</font>

541
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,620
<font color="yellow">The copycat has to see it and contact us.</font>

542
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,250
<font color="yellow">We have an actor ready to go.</font>

543

<font color="yellow">We have to save Bo Yeon soon.</font>

545
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,400
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't contact us within a hour...</font>

546
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,820
<font color="yellow">let's put up the preview
of Ha Dong Min's corpse.</font>

547
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,330
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon is still talking
to Executive Director Choi</font>

548
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,840
<font color="yellow">so she has oxygen.</font>

549
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,050
<font color="yellow">You have to be very careful.</font>

550
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,940
<font color="yellow">If the media reveals that
Ha Dong Min is still in prison</font>

551
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,170
<font color="yellow">we may end up provoking
her kidnapper by lying.</font>

552
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,690
<font color="yellow">The higher-ups have taken measures,
so let's just wait for contact.</font>

553
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,390
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

554
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,690
<font color="yellow">why isn't Hyun Woo's kidnapper
sending today's mission?</font>

555
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,810
<font color="yellow">He seems to know what's going on here.</font>

556
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,950
<font color="yellow">Maybe he doesn't want Park Bo Yeon
to get injured.</font>

557
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,720
<font color="yellow">I suppose that could be true.</font>

562
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,090
<font color="yellow">I've heard a lot about you,
but I've never been able to meet you.</font>

563
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,760
<font color="yellow">Why would we have any reason to meet?</font>

564
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,220
<font color="yellow">Still, you were a senior that
my late husband respected.</font>

565
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,500
<font color="yellow">He said you were a classmate
he was very close to.</font>

566
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,510
<font color="yellow">He told me a great deal about you.</font>

567
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,780
<font color="yellow">He respected me? I don't know about that.</font>

568
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,650
<font color="yellow">We just drank together and played poker.
That was all.</font>

569
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,540
<font color="yellow">What brings you here today?</font>

570
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,970
<font color="yellow">Ah, I saw the preview.</font>

571
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:54,020
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie and say that Ha Dong Min
is at the station when he's in prison?</font>

572
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,740
<font color="yellow">Have you made a decision on his lawyer's
request on the legality of his arrest?</font>

573
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,620
<font color="yellow">I am going to dismiss it.</font>

574
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,010
<font color="yellow">Please release Ha Dong Min.</font>

575
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,780
<font color="yellow">Why should I do that?</font>

576
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,710
<font color="yellow">Our show's assistant director has been
kidnapped by copycat culprits.</font>

577
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,180
<font color="yellow">She's buried somewhere
with nothing but a phone.</font>

578
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,040
<font color="yellow">Her kidnapper is threatening to kill her
unless Ha Dong Min is punished today.</font>

579
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,220
<font color="yellow">What do you mean punished today?</font>

580
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,070
<font color="yellow">Do you mean he must be killed like
your son's kidnapper has been doing?</font>

581
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,440
<font color="yellow">Of course, we would protect
Ha Dong Min once we have him.</font>

582
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,760
<font color="yellow">What if I trusted you?</font>

583
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,230
<font color="yellow">And I released a person when
I had made the decision not to.</font>

584
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,300
<font color="yellow">What if he ends up really dying?</font>

585
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,660
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're retiring soon.</font>

586
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,680
<font color="yellow">And you're planning on
setting up your own law practice.</font>

587
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,240
<font color="yellow">You've never had any corruption issues.</font>

588
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,970
<font color="yellow">Your wife is ill,
so you want to start over.</font>

589
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,810
<font color="yellow">What of it?</font>

590
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,640
<font color="yellow">SG Group's lead counsel position
is vacant at the moment.</font>

their legal department a new image.</font>

592
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,610
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

593
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,140
<font color="yellow">Is anyone out there?</font>

594
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,490
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

595
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,480
<font color="yellow">This morning from 9:00 to noon,
where were you?</font>

596
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,120
<font color="yellow">Did you go to work?</font>

597
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,590
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't feeling very good.</font>

598
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,640
<font color="yellow">I took half the day off
and came into work during lunch.</font>

599
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,230
<font color="yellow">Can anyone verify that
you were home this morning?</font>

600
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,600
<font color="yellow">I was alone.</font>

601
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,560
<font color="yellow">My family members left
for work around 8:00 a.m.</font>

602
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,260
<font color="yellow">This apartment is
a place you rent, right?</font>

603
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, but what is this about?</font>

604
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,630
<font color="yellow">I left in the middle of a meeting.</font>

605
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,820
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon... where is she?</font>

606
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,590
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon?</font>

607
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,180
<font color="yellow">Who... who is that?</font>

608
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,800
<font color="yellow">The person you conspired to kidnap
in the Wanted fan club.</font>

609
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,280
<font color="yellow">Where did you bury her?</font>

610
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,800
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

611
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,500
<font color="yellow">You just show up like this and
start asking me this nonsense.</font>

612
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,250
<font color="yellow">Are you even really police?</font>

613
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,880
<font color="yellow">If you really want to investigate,
come back with a warrant.</font>

614
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,780
<font color="yellow">I came out in the middle of a meeting,
so I have to head back in.</font>

615
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,540
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why are you doing this?</font>

616
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,430
<font color="yellow">If he has a navigation app,
look for recent places he went to.</font>

617
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,630
<font color="yellow">Give me your pin.</font>

618
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,800
<font color="yellow">Seriously, this is crazy.</font>

619
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,420
<font color="yellow">You have to tell me what this
is about for me to deny it.</font>

620
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,720
<font color="yellow">Do you even have proof of anything?</font>

621
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,130
<font color="yellow">You live in Seoul.</font>

622
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,780
<font color="yellow">Where did you get so much dirt
on your shoes on the way to work?</font>

623
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,050
<font color="yellow">I had a few drinks in a park with my
friends in the park a few days ago.</font>

624
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,970
<font color="yellow">Is that a crime?</font>

625
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,300
<font color="yellow">We'll let you go if there's nothing here,
so just tell me.</font>

626
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,130
<font color="yellow">One, six, zero, six, two, three.</font>

627
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,540
<font color="yellow">Tell me now. Where is Park Bo Yeon?</font>

628
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,220
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

629
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,950
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

630
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,600
<font color="yellow">It could break so put your shovels
down and use your hands.</font>

631
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,330
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and dig.</font>

632
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,500
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon.</font>

633
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,610
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon.</font>

634
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,740
<font color="yellow">Be... be careful!</font>

635
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,780
<font color="yellow">Please save me.</font>

636
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,220
<font color="yellow">She's alive. She's alive!</font>

637
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,060
<font color="yellow">Please save me...</font>

638
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,140
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

639
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,960
<font color="yellow">Bo Yeon, you did good.</font>

640
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,200
<font color="yellow">You're okay now.</font>

641
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,340
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Yeon, are you okay?</font>

643
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,800
<font color="yellow">How is she?</font>

644
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,430
<font color="yellow">She just fell asleep.</font>

645
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,700
<font color="yellow">Thankfully, there are no other issues
besides shock and exhaustion.</font>

646
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,450
<font color="yellow">What a relief.</font>

647
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,940
<font color="yellow">What kind of person was her kidnapper?</font>

648
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,160
<font color="yellow">He was just an average guy.</font>

649
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,560
<font color="yellow">Someone you could see anywhere.</font>

650
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,850
<font color="yellow">He graduated from a college in Seoul
and had a pretty good job.</font>

651
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,020
<font color="yellow">He wasn't struggling to make a living.</font>

652
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,110
<font color="yellow">But, he had to give up the things
he really wanted.</font>

653
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,670
<font color="yellow">An average person like that.</font>

654
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,470
<font color="yellow">Why would he have done
something like this?</font>

655
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,920
<font color="yellow">He saw the show.</font>

656
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,220
<font color="yellow">He said he wanted to become special too.</font>

657
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,540
<font color="yellow">I'm determined to find Hyun Woo.</font>

658
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,500
<font color="yellow">I'm determined to
catch his kidnapper too.</font>

659
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,800
<font color="yellow">We'll do ten episodes of this crazy show.</font>

660
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,640
<font color="yellow">Before it ends the way
the kidnapper wants...</font>

661
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,320
<font color="yellow">Before more people
get hurt or destroyed...</font>

662
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,510
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get ahead of
it all and catch him.</font>

663
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,940
<font color="yellow">Why are you staring at someone eating?</font>

664
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,360
<font color="yellow">You can have some
if you didn't eat lunch.</font>

665
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,780
<font color="yellow">Did you hear about today's show?</font>

666
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,950
<font color="yellow">I heard.</font>

667
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,500
<font color="yellow">I heard that Jung Hye In went to the
judge and asked for your release.</font>

668
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,510
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

669
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,010
<font color="yellow">is he going to release me?</font>

670
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,820
<font color="yellow">SG Group's lead counsel position
is vacant at the moment.</font>

671
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:36,310
<font color="yellow">They need a wise legal mind to give
their legal department a new image.</font>

672
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,180
<font color="yellow">I, no...</font>

673
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:47,980
<font color="yellow">SG Group and Hyun Woo's uncle would
like to have a meeting with you.</font>

674
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,090
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In.</font>

675
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,750
<font color="yellow">I truly hope you find your son,
Song Hyun Woo.</font>

676
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,040
<font color="yellow">I mean that.</font>

677
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,910
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

678
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,220
<font color="yellow">I hope that the assistant director
ends up safe, as well.</font>

679
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,770
<font color="yellow">However... I cannot release Ha Dong Min.</font>

680
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,750
<font color="yellow">Judge!</font>

681
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,930
<font color="yellow">I have never made judgments based
on my emotions or for any cause.</font>

682
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:22,140
<font color="yellow">I only look at the law to see whether
Ha Dong Min should be in prison or not.</font>

683
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,930
<font color="yellow">I look only to the basic fundamentals
and principles of law.</font>

684
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,720
<font color="yellow">Using those reasons,
I believe he should be in prison.</font>

685
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,320
<font color="yellow">- But...
- Good luck finding Hyun Woo.</font>

686
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,020
<font color="yellow">I hope his kidnapper ends up receiving
severe punishment under the law.</font>

687
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,420
<font color="yellow"><i>This is the seventh mission.</i></font>

688
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Get Lee Ji Eun to appear on Wanted.</i></font>

689
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,570
<font color="yellow">Last time, you told me that your dad
was the only person who believes you.</font>

690
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:15,290
<font color="yellow">You said that it was the world that
made him a depressed alcoholic.</font>

691
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,840
<font color="yellow">Then before that happened.</font>

692
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,060
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

693
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,700
<font color="yellow">Seven years ago...</font>

694
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:35,410
<font color="yellow">Tell me what happened
to your dad seven years ago.</font>

695
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,660
<font color="yellow">Can we talk about that?</font>

696
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,270
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say.</font>

697
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,910
<font color="yellow">People saw Wanted today.</font>

698
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,660
<font color="yellow">They committed a copycat kidnapping.</font>

699
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,180
<font color="yellow">They kidnapped a member
of the broadcast team</font>

700
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,010
<font color="yellow">and demanded we kill Ha Dong Min.</font>

701
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,160
<font color="yellow">They buried her in the ground.</font>

702
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,030
<font color="yellow">This isn't what you wanted.</font>

703
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,970
<font color="yellow">If you want to tell me something...</font>

704
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,410
<font color="yellow">If something bad happened to you,
tell me about it.</font>

705
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,530
<font color="yellow">Would your dad still believe you
if he saw you like this?</font>

706
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,950
<font color="yellow">Are you okay if he wouldn't?</font>

707
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,880
<font color="yellow">- My dad is dead.
- Is that why it doesn't matter?</font>

708
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,830
<font color="yellow">So, what happened?</font>

709
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,640
<font color="yellow">Did you kill Ha Dong Min?</font>

710
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,840
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

711
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,010
<font color="yellow">We caught the copycat kidnapper.</font>

712
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,740
<font color="yellow">What about the broadcast team member?</font>

713
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,470
<font color="yellow">We saved her right before she died.</font>

714
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,950
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min.</font>

715
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,470
<font color="yellow">Ha Dong Min can't die.</font>

716
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,600
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

717
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,320
<font color="yellow">If he dies now...</font>

718
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,340
<font color="yellow">Let me use your phone.</font>

719
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,010
<font color="yellow">Who are you going to call?</font>

720
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,020
<font color="yellow">You'll know once I call.</font>

721
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,570
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's me, Ha Dong Min.</font>

722
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,130
<font color="yellow">I think it's safer for me
in here for now.</font>

723
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:32,340
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should make it easy
for me to get out once this show is done?</font>

724
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,280
<font color="yellow">Look...</font>

725
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,980
<font color="yellow">The whole world already knows my face
and I'm just a monster now.</font>

726
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,240
<font color="yellow">I was already arrested
and I'm in prison.</font>

727
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,650
<font color="yellow">I can expose that and
it won't destroy me any further.</font>

728
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,310
<font color="yellow">I'm keeping my mouth shut for
the person who needs to be careful.</font>

729
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,130
<font color="yellow">Jung Hye In went to see
the judge to get me released.</font>

730
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:04,680
<font color="yellow">If she keeps that up,
I might as well tell Jung Hye In.</font>

731
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,180
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be better to help
her find the kidnapper quickly?</font>

732
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,190
<font color="yellow">I'm the one in danger of dying.</font>

733
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,380
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Cha, I received the mission.</font>

734
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,940
