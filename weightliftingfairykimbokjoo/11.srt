160
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,530
<font color="yellow">I don't have anything particular on my mind.</font>

161
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,830
<font color="yellow">I'll just help my dad at the restaurant or sleep all day.</font>

162
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,400
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'll go up the mountain and train my spirit.</font>

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,470
<font color="yellow">You can't go up the mountain.</font>

164
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,230
<font color="yellow">Try to stay in town.</font>

165
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,500

166
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,900
<font color="yellow">Don't go too far, either.</font>

175
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,000
<font color="yellow">Call me before you eat and when you go to the bathroom.</font>

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,300
<font color="yellow">Are you a pervert? Why would I call you in the bathroom?</font>

177
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,870
<font color="yellow">Fine. Don't call me in the bathroom.</font>

178
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,870
<font color="yellow">Call me before and after you eat lunch.</font>

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,530
<font color="yellow">Call me before and after you eat dinner, too. Okay?</font>

180
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,270
<font color="yellow">Why should I call you?</font>

181
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,870
<font color="yellow">It's not bad enough to call you and report everything...</font>

182
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,870
<font color="yellow">Call me at 7pm, too. I like 7pm. Okay?</font>

183
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,330
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, you're awesome.</font>

184
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,330
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You never get better.</font>

185

191
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,530
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you.</font>

192
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,900

193
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,130
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

194
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,530
<font color="yellow">Can I ask something about Bok Joo?</font>

195
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,170
<font color="yellow">Why did she leave the dormitory?</font>

196
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,030
<font color="yellow">Did she quit school?</font>

197
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,670
<font color="yellow">Why? Is that what you wish for?</font>

198
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,800
<font color="yellow">No. I don't hate her that much.</font>

199
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,700
<font color="yellow">She's my roommate.</font>

200
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,470
<font color="yellow">You're such a good roommate.</font>

201
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,300
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

202
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,870
<font color="yellow">I didn't let you have a break, so you can mop the floor.</font>

203
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,770
<font color="yellow">While you're at it, have a good rest,</font>

204
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,670
<font color="yellow">or go out and do the things you always wanted to do.</font>

205

<font color="yellow">Give it to me. You should go to the hospital and get a good dialysis.</font>

206
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,730
<font color="yellow">I'll come with you.</font>

207
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,070
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You don't need to.</font>

208
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,600
<font color="yellow">I'll go by myself. I don't need anyone to come.</font>

209

211
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,670
<font color="yellow">studying at a library.</font>

212
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,700

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,000
<font color="yellow">Third,</font>

224
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,100
<font color="yellow">What's the reason?</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

228
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,400
<font color="yellow">I spoke her on the phone, but she didn't say much.</font>

229
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,630
<font color="yellow">Maybe they know.</font>

230

231
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,040

236
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,700
<font color="yellow">I don't need to do anything.</font>

237
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,630
<font color="yellow">Min Young, you cut your hair.</font>

238
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,270

<font color="yellow">Is that so? It looks shorter today.</font>

240

<font color="yellow">Maybe your face grew longer, then.</font>

241
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,100
<font color="yellow">All right. As you know, the winter training finally begins today.</font>

242

<font color="yellow">Okay. Good.</font>

246

355
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,130
<font color="yellow">I noticed that your eyes were sparkling when you were with her.</font>

356
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,800
<font color="yellow">Good luck. She's cute.</font>

357
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,530
<font color="yellow">Is that why you rejected her?</font>

358
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,870
<font color="yellow">You made her cry. You're so slow-witted.</font>

359
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,130
<font color="yellow">You should've known when she was asking you, "Do you like Messi?"</font>

360
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,100
<font color="yellow">I told you. I had no idea that was what she meant.</font>

361
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,470
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

362
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,500
<font color="yellow">When are you going to tell her?</font>

363
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,630
<font color="yellow">I'll have to see.</font>

364
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,630
<font color="yellow">It's not the right time yet.</font>

365

366
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,230
<font color="yellow">She's taking a break from training, too.</font>

367
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,330
<font color="yellow">I'll help her get through the phase and wait for the right time.</font>

368
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, look at you.</font>

369
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,530

<font color="yellow">We sure do share the same blood.</font>

371

<font color="yellow">I can see that you really like her.</font>

372
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,100
<font color="yellow">Yes. Did you think I was making it up?</font>

373
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,270
<font color="yellow">If you make her cry once again,</font>

374
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,470
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kick your...</font>

375
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,900
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so scared.</font>

376
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,730
<font color="yellow">Are you going to punch me?</font>

377
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,000
<font color="yellow">Well, I won't punch you.</font>

378
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,330
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing to be congratulated on.</font>

379
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,900
<font color="yellow">I'll have to work so hard.</font>

380

387
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,900
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? She has huge under-eye dark circles, too.</font>

388

462
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,970
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, what's wrong with you?</font>

463
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

464
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,730
<font color="yellow">but I think he's a little sick.</font>

465
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,370
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now. See you tomorrow.</font>

466
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,200
<font color="yellow">Let's have udon together next time.</font>

467
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,030
<font color="yellow">You're still young. Stay strong.</font>

468
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,870
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Are you allergic to udon?</font>

469
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,830
<font color="yellow">Sometimes...</font>

470
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,400
<font color="yellow">when I'm in bad condition.</font>

471
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,570
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

472
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

473
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,370
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

474
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,670
<font color="yellow">You're too impatient.</font>

475
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,000
<font color="yellow">By the way, who was that arrogant-looking guy?</font>

476
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,200
<font color="yellow">Is he a full-time employee?</font>

477
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
<font color="yellow">That guy?</font>

478
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,900
<font color="yellow">He's a part-time worker.</font>

479
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,170
<font color="yellow">He treats me well like his sister.</font>

480
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,730
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

481
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,670
<font color="yellow">You talk about him as if he's close to you.</font>

482
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,300
<font color="yellow">Don't act friendly with everyone.</font>

483
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,530
<font color="yellow">Except for your dad and uncle, you should keep a distance from men.</font>

484
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,170
<font color="yellow">What about you? Should I also keep a distance since you're a man?</font>

485
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,200
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

486
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,270
<font color="yellow">Let me be an exception.</font>

487
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,770
<font color="yellow">You're ridiculous.</font>

488
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,530
<font color="yellow">How's your part-time job?</font>

489
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,430
<font color="yellow">I heard it's a difficult job even for men.</font>

490
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,130
<font color="yellow">Of course it's difficult. It's different from weightlifting,</font>

491
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,670
<font color="yellow">but it's not so bad.</font>

492
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,270
<font color="yellow">After I work for a while,</font>

493
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,400
<font color="yellow">I start to sweat.</font>

494
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
<font color="yellow">When I drink a cup of instant coffee during break,</font>

495
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,400
<font color="yellow">it feels amazing.</font>

496
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<font color="yellow">You sound like you've been doing physical labor for years.</font>

497
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,530
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you a secret.</font>

498
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,970
<font color="yellow">I'm going to learn how to play the piano with the money I earn.</font>

499
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,330
<font color="yellow">Piano?</font>

500
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,700
<font color="yellow">Is it piano this time instead of cello?</font>

501
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,970
<font color="yellow">I said cello because I saw one of his decorations.</font>

502
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,730
<font color="yellow">I've wanted to play the piano ever since I was young.</font>

503
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,800
<font color="yellow">Every girl in my class could play it except me.</font>

504
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,730
<font color="yellow">All I played was sports when I was young.</font>

505
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,630
<font color="yellow">I also want to learn how to play the cello,</font>

506
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,330
<font color="yellow">but it seems too difficult.</font>

507
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,530
<font color="yellow">It's more expensive than piano lessons.</font>

508
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,370
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I can't wait.</font>

509
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,300
<font color="yellow">Do, re, mi.</font>

510
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,000
<font color="yellow">It'll suit you.</font>

511
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,800
<font color="yellow">You have long fingers, too.</font>

512
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,930
<font color="yellow">I'll play "Wedding March" at your wedding.</font>

513
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

514
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,600
<font color="yellow">You'll only ruin my wedding.</font>

515
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

516
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,870
<font color="yellow">why don't you stand next to me?</font>

517
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,900
<font color="yellow">Why would I stand next to you instead of your wife?</font>

518
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,330
<font color="yellow">Fine, don't.</font>

519
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,800
<font color="yellow">Don't stand next to me.</font>

520
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,500
<font color="yellow">Just eat.</font>

521
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,330
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to that arrogant guy.</font>

522
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,370
<font color="yellow">It makes me feel upset.</font>

523
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you think he's good-looking?</font>

524
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,600
<font color="yellow">Here. I'd like to hear about you.</font>

525
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,330
<font color="yellow">What are you up to these days?</font>

526
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,070
<font color="yellow">I'm helping out my sister.</font>

527
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,630
<font color="yellow">She runs a hair salon in front of a university.</font>

528
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,800
<font color="yellow">Scissorhands?</font>

529
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,070
<font color="yellow">Do you even like it?</font>

530
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,830
<font color="yellow">Who cares about that?</font>

531
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
<font color="yellow">I help out with the chores.</font>

532
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,970
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

533
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,930
<font color="yellow">Let's drink together.</font>

534
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

535
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,170
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,930
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Can you walk?</font>

537
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,770
<font color="yellow">Can you?</font>

538
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,270
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me... - Hey.</font>

539
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,800
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

540
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,470
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

541
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,900
<font color="yellow">Get on my back.</font>

542
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you being good to me?</font>

543
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not being good to you.</font>

544
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,670
<font color="yellow">Offering my back isn't such a big deal. Get on.</font>

545
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,900
<font color="yellow">Mister, do you like me?</font>

546
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,030
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this woman?</font>

547
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

548
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,470
<font color="yellow">Why would I like an old woman...</font>

549
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, I like you.</font>

550
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,400
<font color="yellow">I like you, so what?</font>

551
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,400
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to like you?</font>

552
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,470
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

553
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,870
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with a person liking someone else.</font>

554
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,330
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is it?</font>

555
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,200
<font color="yellow">There's one thing that I can't understand at all.</font>

556
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,830
<font color="yellow">That's love.</font>

557
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,970
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

558
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,900
<font color="yellow">Why don't we date each other?</font>

559
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

560
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,330
<font color="yellow">Let's date each other.</font>

561
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,500
<font color="yellow">Before I become an old granny,</font>

562
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,630
<font color="yellow">let's just date each other like it's not a big deal.</font>

563
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
<font color="yellow">Do you mean it?</font>

564
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,030
<font color="yellow">You're not saying it because you're drunk.</font>

565
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,400
<font color="yellow">Do you really mean it?</font>

566
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,370
<font color="yellow">Are you being serious?</font>

567
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,730
<font color="yellow">Don't you believe me?</font>

568
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,030
<font color="yellow">Shall I prove it to you?</font>

569
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,400
<font color="yellow">You don't have to walk me home.</font>

570
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,570
<font color="yellow">I can defend myself if someone attacks me.</font>

571
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,770
<font color="yellow">No way. Even if you're strong, you can't defeat a man.</font>

572
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,900
<font color="yellow">- Ouch. - What about now?</font>

573
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,830
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

574
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,100
<font color="yellow">You'd better watch what you say.</font>

575
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,030
<font color="yellow">Gosh, the winter smells amazing. It's so refreshing.</font>

576
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,370
<font color="yellow">It's cold. I want it to be spring soon.</font>

577
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,000
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

578
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,000
<font color="yellow">I saw Dr. Jeong today on the street.</font>

579
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,300
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

580
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,170
<font color="yellow">You and Jae Yi bump into each other often.</font>

581
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,670
<font color="yellow">He didn't see me, though.</font>

582
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,600
<font color="yellow">How did you feel seeing him again?</font>

583
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,470
<font color="yellow">Did seeing him again tear you apart?</font>

584
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,530
<font color="yellow">It wasn't like that.</font>

585
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,400
<font color="yellow">It just felt strange.</font>

586
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,330
<font color="yellow">The days I went to the clinic because I was crazy about him...</font>

587
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,900
<font color="yellow">seem long ago.</font>

588
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,370
<font color="yellow">You know when you catch a cold...</font>

589
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,170
<font color="yellow">but can't get rid of it no matter what you try?</font>

590
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,700
<font color="yellow">Now, I feel like I'm at the tail end of the cold.</font>

591
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,800
<font color="yellow">Doesn't that mean you're okay now?</font>

592
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,970
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

593
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,440
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

594
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,200
<font color="yellow">Like you said before, time takes care of everything.</font>

595
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, we're here. You should go home now.</font>

596
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,670
<font color="yellow">Can you walk me to school?</font>

597
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,270
<font color="yellow">I'll walk you home again after that.</font>

598
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,130
<font color="yellow">Just go alone. I need to rest for extra work tomorrow.</font>

599
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,230
<font color="yellow">What? You have extra work?</font>

600
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, they told me to work extra tomorrow.</font>

601
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,130
<font color="yellow">What kind of part-time job is that?</font>

602
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,130
<font color="yellow">Won't you finish late at night?</font>

603
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,670
<font color="yellow">It's okay. If I work with that guy, we'll finish early.</font>

604
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,570
<font color="yellow">- That guy? - See you.</font>

605
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep mentioning him?</font>

606
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,330
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

607
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,630
<font color="yellow">Why does she talk about him as if they're close friends?</font>

608
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,530
<font color="yellow">She's friends with anyone who buys her food.</font>

609
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,100
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what do I do?</font>

610
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,270
<font color="yellow">Should I go there again tomorrow?</font>

611
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,070
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

612
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,670
<font color="yellow">That guy.</font>

613
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,940
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

614
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,900
<font color="yellow">A ghost?</font>

615
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,030
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

616
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,900
<font color="yellow">Last night, a fencer saw a ghost with bare feet and got shocked.</font>

617
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,870
<font color="yellow">Maybe she was dreaming.</font>

618
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,200
<font color="yellow">Not everyone with bare feet is a ghost.</font>

619
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,730
<font color="yellow">That's not it. Pale bare feet...</font>

620
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,630
<font color="yellow">were floating above the floor.</font>

621
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
<font color="yellow">It's called the barefoot ghost.</font>

622
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,330
<font color="yellow">According to people, 15 years ago,</font>

623
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,630
<font color="yellow">she lost her medal for taking drugs.</font>

624
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,870
<font color="yellow">She was a runner who killed herself by jumping off a building.</font>

625
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,800
<font color="yellow">They think the ghost is her.</font>

626
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my gosh. - Is the ghost pretty?</font>

627
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,200
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Continue.</font>

628
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,230
<font color="yellow">She took diet pills that her friend gave her.</font>

629
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,440
<font color="yellow">- Then she failed the drug test. - Goodness.</font>

630
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,630
<font color="yellow">She turned into a ghost and looked for her friend every night.</font>

631
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,500
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - That's so scary.</font>

632
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so scary.</font>

633
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,600
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo, come and eat. - Okay.</font>

634
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,370
<font color="yellow">Why is it sticking to my clothes?</font>

635
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

636
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,940
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm coming.</font>

637
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,030
<font color="yellow">I'll come out after I get dressed.</font>

638
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,600
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. The stew will get cold.</font>

639
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,800
<font color="yellow">It must be soybean paste stew. It smells fantastic.</font>

640
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,130
<font color="yellow">Do you need a bowl?</font>

641
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,500
<font color="yellow">I'll get it.</font>

642
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,170
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I'll mix it for you.</font>

643
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,730
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

644
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,000
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to ask me what kind of a part-time job I got?</font>

645
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,000
<font color="yellow">I don't need to ask...</font>

646
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,230
<font color="yellow">as long as it's not something bad.</font>

647
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,470
<font color="yellow">I won't meddle in everything anymore.</font>

648
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,130
<font color="yellow">You can go back to school if you ever feel up to it.</font>

649
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
<font color="yellow">Do what you want to do.</font>

650
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,200
<font color="yellow">It's your life, not mine.</font>

651
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,170
<font color="yellow">Here. Try it. I mixed it well.</font>

652
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,870
<font color="yellow">It's so salty, Dad.</font>

653
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,330
<font color="yellow">Really? I'm sorry.</font>

654
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,270
<font color="yellow">Where did Dae Ho go so early this morning?</font>

655
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,870
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him all day.</font>

656
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,400
<font color="yellow">My goodness! I must've been crazy.</font>

657
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,070
<font color="yellow">I won't drink alcohol anymore.</font>

658
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Alcohol always gives me trouble.</font>

659
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,100
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - What should I do?</font>

660
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
<font color="yellow">Did you drink alcohol and do something?</font>

661
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,500
<font color="yellow">Whatever. This is all your fault.</font>

662
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,130
<font color="yellow">It's because you borrowed money from me.</font>

663
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,700
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I shouldn't say more.</font>

664
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,940
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

665
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,570
<font color="yellow">That's right. I was drunk. Let's just pretend it never happened.</font>

666
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,400
<font color="yellow">Maybe he was drunk, and he doesn't remember it.</font>

667
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,630
<font color="yellow">Welcome. Please have a seat here.</font>

668
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,700
<font color="yellow">- What can I do for you? - Well...</font>

669
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,570
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there?</font>

670
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,030
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

671
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,300
<font color="yellow">I brought you hangover food.</font>

672
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,000
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Bok Joo.</font>

673
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,900
<font color="yellow">You do your job so well. I like you very much.</font>

674
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,030
<font color="yellow">Right? My dad runs a chicken restaurant,</font>

675
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,630
<font color="yellow">and he said I'm a natural worker.</font>

676
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,000
<font color="yellow">Do you have a boyfriend?</font>

677
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,940
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I'll introduce you to my nephew.</font>

678
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,230
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

679
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
<font color="yellow">Shall I meet him?</font>

680
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,530
<font color="yellow">Hey. You do have a boyfriend.</font>

681
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,800
<font color="yellow">That guy with glaring eyes I saw yesterday.</font>

682
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,900
<font color="yellow">He looks a bit like me.</font>

683
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He's not my boyfriend.</font>

684
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,300
<font color="yellow">Come on. I could tell you were more than just friends.</font>

685
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,800
<font color="yellow">He even glared at me.</font>

686
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,130
<font color="yellow">He's just a friend who is a guy.</font>

687
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,300
<font color="yellow">He's just a guy. A human.</font>

688
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,030
<font color="yellow">Aren't I better than him?</font>

689
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,000
<font color="yellow">You're a lot better.</font>

690
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,570
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Gosh.</font>

691
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,670
<font color="yellow">Sir. When are you going to introduce me to your nephew?</font>

692
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,870
<font color="yellow">Hey. Let's go out.</font>

693
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go to a cyber cafe and play games.</font>

694
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,330
<font color="yellow">No. I don't feel like it.</font>

695
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,970
<font color="yellow">Okay. If you're all determined,</font>

696
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,440
<font color="yellow">I'll just go, then.</font>

697
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,630
<font color="yellow">- Get a good rest by yourself. - Hey!</font>

698
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,870
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

699
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,440
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. You're even working overtime today.</font>

700
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, that guy?</font>

701
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,300
<font color="yellow">He's a part-time worker.</font>

702
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,100
<font color="yellow">He treats me well like his sister.</font>

703
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,500
<font color="yellow">That sly punk. He definitely gave her a dirty look.</font>

704
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,830
<font color="yellow">- I'll get it from the warehouse. - I'll go with you. It's heavy.</font>

705
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,530
<font color="yellow">Keep moving them.</font>

706
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,230
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you later.</font>

707
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,600
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

708
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,230
<font color="yellow">My shoelace. Gosh.</font>

709
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,830
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

710
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,630
<font color="yellow">I can't see it.</font>

711
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,930
<font color="yellow">How did you get in here?</font>

712
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,130
<font color="yellow">How else? I just walked in.</font>

713
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,430
<font color="yellow">Do you still have much to do?</font>

714
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,730
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

715
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,170
<font color="yellow">What brought you here again?</font>

716
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,030
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

717
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,570
<font color="yellow">I went to a club, but the girls weren't pretty.</font>

718
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,770
<font color="yellow">Don't go to clubs so often. You'll hurt your bones.</font>

719
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,430
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I have thick bones.</font>

720
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,330
<font color="yellow">If you have much to do, I can help you.</font>

721
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,870
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Just go before people see you.</font>

722
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,230
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I said it's fine. Hurry up and go.</font>

723
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,430
<font color="yellow">Since I'm here, I'll help you out.</font>

724
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,130
<font color="yellow">You should finish it and go home.</font>

725
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,670
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

726
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,500
<font color="yellow">I just don't want people to misunderstand.</font>

727
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,430
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

728
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,300
<font color="yellow">They think you're my boyfriend.</font>

729
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,300
<font color="yellow">They won't believe you're just a friend.</font>

730
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,000
<font color="yellow">If they see us, they will definitely misunderstand. So just go.</font>

731
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,900
<font color="yellow">They didn't misunderstand.</font>

732
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:54,870
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

733
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,430
<font color="yellow">You're not just a friend.</font>

734
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,730
<font color="yellow">You're a special friend to me.</font>

735
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,630
<font color="yellow">Can't you see what I'm trying to say?</font>

736
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,900
<font color="yellow">What... What are you doing? Are you crazy?</font>

737
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,030
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm crazy.</font>

738
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,330
<font color="yellow">If I wasn't, I wouldn't do this.</font>

739
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,400
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

740
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,700
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

741
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,930
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

742
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,870
<font color="yellow">Not as a friend, but as a girl.</font>

743
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,630
<font color="yellow">If I don't see you, I get curious.</font>

744
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,130
<font color="yellow">If you're depressed, I get upset.</font>

745
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,000
<font color="yellow">If you smile, it makes me happy. If you're sick, I get worried.</font>

746
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,070
<font color="yellow">It's driving me crazy.</font>

747
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,670
<font color="yellow">It means...</font>

748
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,930
<font color="yellow">I like you, doesn't it?</font>

749
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,830
<font color="yellow">Gosh, is he asleep already?</font>

750
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

751
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,030
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung!</font>

752
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,770
<font color="yellow">Who locked this door?</font>

753
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,500
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm freezing.</font>

754
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,430
<font color="yellow">I can't go home right now, Mom. The winter training has started.</font>

755
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,970
<font color="yellow">I get a sleepover next week. I'll go home then.</font>

756
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,200
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just hire someone instead of asking me?</font>

757
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,770
<font color="yellow">I can't keep...</font>

758
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
<font color="yellow">Mom? Mom...</font>

759
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,000
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

760
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,500
<font color="yellow">It's me, Tae Kwon.</font>

761
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,800
<font color="yellow">- What were you doing there? - Well...</font>

762
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,470
<font color="yellow">I went out to play some games, but someone locked the window.</font>

763
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,430
<font color="yellow">The window here was open, and your voice sounded familiar.</font>

764
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,100
<font color="yellow">Did you hear everything?</font>

765
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,370
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't hear what you said. I just heard your voice.</font>

766
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,100
<font color="yellow">Fine. Just go.</font>

767
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,800
<font color="yellow">You're going to get me into trouble.</font>

768
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,800
<font color="yellow">- Well... - Where on earth is Seon Ok?</font>

769
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my stomach hurts.</font>

770
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,630
<font color="yellow">Maybe the chicken feet were too spicy.</font>

771
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,170
<font color="yellow">Why am I the only one with the stomachache?</font>

772
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,770
<font color="yellow">Where did Seon Ok go in the middle of the night?</font>

773
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,000
<font color="yellow">Go! Go away!</font>

774
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,600
<font color="yellow">Go away! Go!</font>

775
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

776
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,700
<font color="yellow">- There's a ghost. - A ghost?</font>

777
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,770
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Seon Ok. There was a ghost there.</font>

778
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,770
<font color="yellow">What? Where? There's nothing.</font>

779
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,470
<font color="yellow">- It was there. Where did it go? - Gosh, calm down.</font>

780
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,370
<font color="yellow">I think it's gone.</font>

781
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,630
<font color="yellow">- It was definitely there. - Calm down.</font>

782
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,800
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Oh, dear.</font>

783
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,700
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

784
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,830
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. Stop punishing me and talk.</font>

785
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,730
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

786
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,100
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

787
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,270
<font color="yellow">Why... Why me?</font>

788
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

789
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,030
<font color="yellow">It just doesn't make sense.</font>

790
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,570
<font color="yellow">It wasn't long ago when I was crying and upset because of your brother.</font>

791
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

792
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,800
<font color="yellow">Is it because you pity me?</font>

793
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,170
<font color="yellow">Guys I like don't like me back, and I've never had a boyfriend.</font>

794
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,270
<font color="yellow">Do you feel bad for me?</font>

795
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,500
<font color="yellow">I don't do charity.</font>

796
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,130
<font color="yellow">- Why then? - I can't explain why.</font>

797
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,530
<font color="yellow">There is no reason for liking someone.</font>

798
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,300
<font color="yellow">I like you because I just do.</font>

799
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,700
<font color="yellow">Besides, I realized that...</font>

800
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,230
<font color="yellow">I started to like you a long time ago.</font>

801
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,470
<font color="yellow">You're my first love.</font>

802
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,700
<font color="yellow">What is it supposed to mean? Do you hate me or something?</font>

803
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,170
<font color="yellow">Well... No, I don't hate you.</font>

804
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,730
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I say... All right. I like you, too.</font>

805
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,870
<font color="yellow">These days, I lean on you more than Seon Ok and Nan Hee at times.</font>

806
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,430
<font color="yellow">You make me feel safe.</font>

807
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,070
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

808
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,930
<font color="yellow">you're... To be honest, you're a little handsome.</font>

809
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,970
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize it at first, but I've come to admit it.</font>

810
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,770
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

811
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,500
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

812
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,470
<font color="yellow">I like you as a friend.</font>

813
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,900
<font color="yellow">I've never felt romantically towards you.</font>

814
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,100
<font color="yellow">Then start now.</font>

815
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,030
<font color="yellow">Go out with me...</font>

816
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,530
<font color="yellow">for just one month.</font>

817
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,200
<font color="yellow">See if you can be attracted to me...</font>

818
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,630
<font color="yellow">and find out how I can be as a boyfriend.</font>

819
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,430
<font color="yellow">Get a full experience and decide whether you want to do it or not.</font>

820
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,200
<font color="yellow">Is this a home shopping channel? That sounds ridiculous.</font>

821
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,730
<font color="yellow">Then are you just going to reject me?</font>

822
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,600
<font color="yellow">We've been through many things together.</font>

823
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,800
<font color="yellow">You should at least give me a chance.</font>

824
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,600
<font color="yellow">I'll take that as a yes.</font>

825
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,430
<font color="yellow">Let's go. It's cold.</font>

826
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,930
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that lunatic.</font>

827
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,770
<font color="yellow">Are you not coming?</font>

828
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,370
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Goodness.</font>

829
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,930
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

830
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,200
<font color="yellow">Keep walking. Why are you staring at me?</font>

831
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,370
<font color="yellow">Go! What do you want?</font>

832
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,270
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep looking at me? Just go.</font>

833
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Kim Bok Joo, you're too much.</font>

834
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

835
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,930
<font color="yellow">Do you know how uncool you are right now?</font>

836
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you being all awkward with me?</font>

837
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,900
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm not being awkward at all.</font>

838
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,770
<font color="yellow">What do I expect? You've probably never had a guy confess to you.</font>

839
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,800
<font color="yellow">Try to stop being so awkward. Be natural.</font>

840
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,600
<font color="yellow">I'm being so natural. Blame your unnatural thoughts.</font>

841
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,130
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Nan Hee. - Bok Joo.</font>

842
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,300
<font color="yellow">I almost died from a heart attack earlier.</font>

843
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,370
<font color="yellow">My heart is still pumping so fast. I'm so scared.</font>

844
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,400
<font color="yellow">I just saw a ghost.</font>

845
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,500
<font color="yellow">I can't explain it over the phone.</font>

846
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,530
<font color="yellow">I'd be less scared if you were here.</font>

847
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,000
<font color="yellow">- Come back soon. I'm terrified. - Hey.</font>

848
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,470
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll go home first and head over there. Okay.</font>

849
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,170
<font color="yellow">- Do your friends need you? - Yes.</font>

850
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,200
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee said she saw a ghost or something. Who knows what happened?</font>

851
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,030
<font color="yellow">I should hurry, though. See you.</font>

852
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll walk you home.</font>

853
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,300
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's right there. Just get going.</font>

854
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,200
<font color="yellow">She sure loves her friends.</font>

855
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,200
<font color="yellow">She's so loyal to her friends.</font>

856
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,630
<font color="yellow">She rejected me just as I expected.</font>

857
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,870
<font color="yellow">It's all that weasel's fault.</font>

858
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,170
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

859
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,400
<font color="yellow">Is this Bok Joo's?</font>

860
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,030
<font color="yellow">It is her wallet.</font>

861
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why does she carry so much cash?</font>

862
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,670
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's probably her pay from today.</font>

863
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,030
<font color="yellow">How can she be so clumsy about her hard-earned money?</font>

864
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,700
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

865
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,530
<font color="yellow">What else is in Bok Joo's wallet?</font>

866
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh, look at that face. Is she on a most-wanted list or what?</font>

867
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,030
<font color="yellow">From her eyes and nose...</font>

868
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,500
<font color="yellow">to her lips, everything is mediocre.</font>

869
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:25,170
<font color="yellow">But together, they look harmonious and cute.</font>

870
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,800
<font color="yellow">What is this? What on earth is this? Goodness gracious.</font>

871
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,970
<font color="yellow">Jeong Jae Yi.</font>

872
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,270
<font color="yellow">Jeong Jae Yi, this...</font>

873
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,730
<font color="yellow">What's this now?</font>

874
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,470
<font color="yellow">"Things that I want to do".</font>

875
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,130
<font color="yellow">It must be her bucket list.</font>

876
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,030
<font color="yellow">"First. Studying at a library."</font>

877
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,370
<font color="yellow">You wish.</font>

878
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,470
<font color="yellow">You'll fall asleep in 5 minutes. I bet you 100 dollars.</font>

879
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,200
<font color="yellow">"Second. Learning how to play an instrument. Piano, maybe."</font>

880
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,700
<font color="yellow">Piano? That I heard.</font>

881
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,770
<font color="yellow">"Third. Going to an amusement park on a weekday..."</font>

882
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,430
<font color="yellow">"and riding five attractions."</font>

883
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,470
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

884
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,000
<font color="yellow">On weekends, you waste so much time waiting in the lines.</font>

885
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,700
<font color="yellow">"Fourth".</font>

886
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,800
<font color="yellow">This is the most important one.</font>

887
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,330
<font color="yellow">This is it. This is key.</font>

888
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,630
<font color="yellow">Her wishes are so humble even when it comes down to her boyfriend.</font>

889
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,000
<font color="yellow">Gosh, be quiet.</font>

890
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,900
<font color="yellow">Okay. I obtained key information at a very important moment.</font>

891
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,170
<font color="yellow">The universe is helping me.</font>

892
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,470
<font color="yellow">I got out of the bathroom,</font>

893
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,670
<font color="yellow">then I saw something black and white passing by.</font>

894
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,070
<font color="yellow">I took a look at it again...</font>

895
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,900
<font color="yellow">and saw that her hair was let loose and unkempt.</font>

896
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,870
<font color="yellow">You know those white nightdresses, right?</font>

897
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,530
<font color="yellow">Then she went back into the washroom.</font>

898
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:09,970
<font color="yellow">I was seriously so scared.</font>

899
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,930
<font color="yellow">I would've wet my pants if I hadn't relieved myself already.</font>

900
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. And you would've become a legend...</font>

901
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,230
<font color="yellow">as a girl who wet her pants because of a ghost.</font>

902
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,400
<font color="yellow">You fool. I like you.</font>

903
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
<font color="yellow">Isn't it so scary? Doesn't it give you goose bumps?</font>

904
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,300
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it, no matter how many times I hear the story.</font>

905
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,300
<font color="yellow">I don't believe in ghosts.</font>

906
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:35,000
<font color="yellow">But I'm glad that the incident helped us get together like this.</font>

907
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,730
<font color="yellow">When will you return to training, Bok Joo?</font>

908
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,670
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

909
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,830
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

910
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,230
<font color="yellow">Come back soon, Bok Joo.</font>

911
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,330
<font color="yellow">I need you to knock out that ghost.</font>

912
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,230
<font color="yellow">Right. Only Bok Joo is strong and fearless enough to catch that ghost.</font>

913
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,700
<font color="yellow">Why is your face so red by the way?</font>

914
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,500
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a fever? - What?</font>

915
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,970
<font color="yellow">No. Why? I don't have a fever.</font>

916
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,170
<font color="yellow">You're right. Her face is beet red.</font>
