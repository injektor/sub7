<font color="yellow">That's quite a look on your face you got there.</font>

307
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,719
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You're crazy.</font>

308
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,849
<font color="yellow">Hey! That was so sudden. I'm just startled.</font>

309
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:49,589
<font color="yellow">I don't want this. You drink it all.</font>

310
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:53,489
<font color="yellow">All right, sorry. You can have it all. I won't drink any.</font>

311
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:05,189
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Nan Hee. - Where are you guys now?</font>

312
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,749
<font color="yellow">Come to the square right now. There will be fireworks.</font>

313
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,149
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

314
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,619
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go watch the fireworks!</font>

315
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,749
<font color="yellow">I'd recommend you to stop taking the pills first.</font>

316
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,889
<font color="yellow">Please come to the hospital and get checked up as soon as possible.</font>

317
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,149
<font color="yellow">I think it already started.</font>

318
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,489
<font color="yellow">My gosh, it's so beautiful!</font>

319
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:58,719
<font color="yellow">How pretty.</font>

320
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:14,049
<font color="yellow">It's cold. Use what you can.</font>

321
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:23,649
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

322
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,289
<font color="yellow">Is your heart fluttering again?</font>

323
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,049
<font color="yellow">It is, isn't it?</font>

324
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,389
<font color="yellow">Will you be in need of emergency cardiac care soon or what?</font>

325
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,689
<font color="yellow">I won't stop you if you want to experience it,</font>

326
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,489
<font color="yellow">but your safety is my priority.</font>

327
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,149
<font color="yellow">I'm very worried about you now.</font>

328
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,689
<font color="yellow">You... You're such a lunatic!</font>

329
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,689
<font color="yellow">You've been going on about it all day long. You're too much.</font>

330
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,919
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way! I can't stand you because you're so annoying.</font>

331
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,989
<font color="yellow">Where did these guys go? Goodness.</font>

332
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,419
<font color="yellow">Gosh, was I too forward with her?</font>

333
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,419
<font color="yellow">She was already feeling uncomfortable.</font>

334
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,249
<font color="yellow">I thought going by her bucket list was a great strategy.</font>

335
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,519
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, this is amazing. - Nan Hee, let's take a photo.</font>

336
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,959
<font color="yellow">- It looks so pretty from here. - Hey, guys.</font>

337
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,719
<font color="yellow">- What took you so long? - Where have you been?</font>

338
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,649
<font color="yellow">- It looked even cooler earlier. - I missed out.</font>

339
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,459
<font color="yellow">- I want to take photos of it. - You should.</font>

340
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,989
<font color="yellow">- Just enjoy it with your eyes. - It's so pretty.</font>

341
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,459
<font color="yellow">It's mesmerizing.</font>

342
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,219
<font color="yellow">My gosh, it's so beautiful.</font>

343
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:37,959
<font color="yellow">Isn't it so pretty, guys?</font>

344
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:41,819
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so happy to be here.</font>

345
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:56,049
<font color="yellow">My crazy heart.</font>

346
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:59,319
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you today?</font>

347
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,249
<font color="yellow">Please come to your senses, okay?</font>

348
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,719
<font color="yellow">All right, it's time to practice.</font>

349
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,849
<font color="yellow">You're doing that again.</font>

350
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:57,689
<font color="yellow">You're going too fast. You have to follow the beat.</font>

351
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:59,019
<font color="yellow">Try it again.</font>

352
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,889
<font color="yellow">No, be gentle.</font>

353
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,319
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm used to doing things with all of my might.</font>

354
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,189
<font color="yellow">Repeat it 10 times. If you don't get this right,</font>

355
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,149
<font color="yellow">- we won't be able to progress. - Okay.</font>

356
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,949
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why can't I do this? Do I have no sense of rhythm or what?</font>

357
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:27,189
<font color="yellow">He hasn't called me at all today. Were you all talk?</font>

358
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,249
<font color="yellow">Or are you taking today off?</font>

359
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,419
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Nan Hee. - Bok Joo.</font>

360
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,019
<font color="yellow">Are you back at school now? Did you get some rest at home?</font>

361
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,619
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm back at school now.</font>

362
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,349
<font color="yellow">But Seon Ok isn't back yet.</font>

363
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,889
<font color="yellow">I think she can't leave home for some reason.</font>

364
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:46,789
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

365
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:49,449
<font color="yellow">- you want to go to Seon Ok's place? - Yes.</font>

366
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,019
<font color="yellow">I think I should.</font>

367
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,489
<font color="yellow">Her phone is off, too. I'm worried about her.</font>

368
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,749
<font color="yellow">All right. Then...</font>

369
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,519
<font color="yellow">you should go.</font>

370
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,289
<font color="yellow">You're getting dialysis today, right?</font>

371
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:09,519
<font color="yellow">- Did Uncle go out again? - Yes. He said that...</font>

372
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,849
<font color="yellow">his friend is throwing a birthday party for his daughter today.</font>

373
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:13,419
<font color="yellow">It's probably a lie, though.</font>

374
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,819
<font color="yellow">- Get going. - I'll see you later, Dad.</font>

375
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,419
<font color="yellow">Make sure you take a taxi, okay?</font>

376
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:20,449
<font color="yellow">Bye, Dad.</font>

377
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,689
<font color="yellow">(Cheonji Motel)</font>

378
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,089
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

379
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,819
<font color="yellow">This place is in the middle of nowhere. It was so hard to find it.</font>

380
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,519
<font color="yellow">Why did you come all the way here?</font>

381
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,989
<font color="yellow">Hello. Just a second, okay?</font>

382
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,419
<font color="yellow">- For half a day or overnight stay? - Half a day, please.</font>

383
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:20,449
<font color="yellow">It'll be 20 dollars.</font>

384
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,249
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, wait for me in this room. I'll be right back.</font>

385
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,319
<font color="yellow">This way, please.</font>

386
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,689
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing up? Have a seat.</font>

387
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:08,419
<font color="yellow">Do you want some yogurt?</font>

388
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,919
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

389
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,519
<font color="yellow">Drink it. It's the only drink we have here.</font>

390
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,119
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Okay.</font>

391
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:17,949
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

392
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,389
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

393
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,519
<font color="yellow">I guess you were worried.</font>

394
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,449
<font color="yellow">Did Nan Hee call you?</font>

395
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,049
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

396
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,349
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

397
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:36,589
<font color="yellow">My parents want me to drop out of school.</font>

398
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:39,389
<font color="yellow">They think I'll never make the national team,</font>

399
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,819
<font color="yellow">and I won't earn much money in a semi-professional team.</font>

400
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:44,419
<font color="yellow">I may not even get into one.</font>

401
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,749
<font color="yellow">They want me to work here and not waste the tuition.</font>

402
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,519
<font color="yellow">They're short of hands here.</font>

403
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:53,519
<font color="yellow">My parents even do wall papering as a part-time job.</font>

404
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,519
<font color="yellow">I also have a younger sibling.</font>

405
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,749
<font color="yellow">I didn't know how to answer my parents.</font>

406
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:02,519
<font color="yellow">It's true that I have no talents for weightlifting.</font>

407
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,189
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? When you were in high school, you won a prize...</font>

408
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,649
<font color="yellow">- at a provincial tournament... - That was effort, not talent.</font>

409
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:12,449
<font color="yellow">Guess what my nickname was in high school.</font>

410
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,089
<font color="yellow">Weightlifting Ghost.</font>

411
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,949
<font color="yellow">It's because I never left the gym just like the ghost in the story.</font>

412
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,089
<font color="yellow">Back then, I stayed there not because I liked weightlifting,</font>

413
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,519
<font color="yellow">but because I hated to be home.</font>

414
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,249
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to be at the front desk in our motel.</font>

415
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,149
<font color="yellow">Weightlifting was the only excuse I could give to escape here.</font>

416
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:36,789
<font color="yellow">But somewhere along the way,</font>

417
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,389
<font color="yellow">I actually started to like weightlifting.</font>

418
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,719
<font color="yellow">It's an honest sport.</font>

419
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,789
<font color="yellow">People appreciate exactly how much I lift.</font>

420
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:52,249
<font color="yellow">I envy you, Bok Joo.</font>

421
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:54,419
<font color="yellow">You have talents,</font>

422
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,489
<font color="yellow">and a father who heartily supports you.</font>

423
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,789
<font color="yellow">I'd be grateful if my parents wouldn't be so opposed to it.</font>

424
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,589
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok.</font>

425
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,149
<font color="yellow">I told you to take out the trash.</font>

426
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,119
<font color="yellow">Don't leave it lying around outside like that.</font>

427
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,519
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

428
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,319
<font color="yellow">Mom, this is my friend, Bok Joo.</font>

429
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:25,949
<font color="yellow">I've mentioned her before. She's my best friend at school.</font>

430
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,219
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

431
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,649
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way here?</font>

432
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,919
<font color="yellow">- Did you give Seon Hee dinner? - Not yet.</font>

433
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,389
<font color="yellow">Can't you just let her eat ramyeon?</font>

434
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,819
<font color="yellow">Why would you let her eat ramyeon when we have food here?</font>

435
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:37,819
<font color="yellow">Go and prepare dinner for her.</font>

436
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,019
<font color="yellow">While you're at it, hang out the laundry as well.</font>

437
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:47,819
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok. I should get going now.</font>

438
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,519
<font color="yellow">No. You came all the way here. Let's go together.</font>

439
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,989
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner, spend the tonight, and go back tomorrow.</font>

440
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,689
<font color="yellow">No. My dad will worry. I'll just go.</font>

441
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:57,819
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

442
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,219
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - All right. Goodbye.</font>

443
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,389
<font color="yellow">Sir. Are you okay?</font>

444
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,219
<font color="yellow">Can I get some help over here?</font>

445
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:50,289
<font color="yellow">The girl who will receive these will be so happy.</font>

446
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:52,119
<font color="yellow">It's for your girlfriend, right?</font>

447
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,389
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

448
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,089
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thank you.</font>

449
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:57,349
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

450
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:58,489
<font color="yellow">Please come again.</font>

451
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,819
<font color="yellow">I hope this will work.</font>

452
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,649
<font color="yellow">I guess Bok Joo is a girl after all.</font>

453
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,819
<font color="yellow">I thought she would hate flowers because she can't eat them.</font>

454
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:25,689
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Hyung.</font>
