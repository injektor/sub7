98

00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,161
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

104
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,531
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt?</font>

105
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,461
<font color="yellow">It hurts. I think I got a bruise.</font>

106
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,261
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot? Do you want to go to the infirmary?</font>

107
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,491
<font color="yellow">You're the one who hurt me.</font>

108
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,531
<font color="yellow">Why did you take my hand around our friends?</font>

109
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,591
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that? We weren't doing anything wrong.</font>

110
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:22,191
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, let's talk about it.</font>

111
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,561
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask you why we should see each other in secret.</font>

112
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,961
<font color="yellow">Are you underage or married?</font>

113
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,861
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

114
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,531
<font color="yellow">do I...</font>

115
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:33,931
<font color="yellow">embarrass you?</font>

116
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,431
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

117
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:37,861
<font color="yellow">Then why?</font>

118
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,031
<font color="yellow">Will you break up with me after a little while?</font>

119
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,831
<font color="yellow">Do I embarrass you? Are you testing me?</font>

120
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,561
<font color="yellow">Don't say things like that.</font>

121
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,691
<font color="yellow">If my friends find out, they'll call me a traitor.</font>

122
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,761
<font color="yellow">After Dr. Jeong, I said I wouldn't ever see men again.</font>

123
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,591
<font color="yellow">This makes me look nuts.</font>

124
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,361
<font color="yellow">Usually, you get over men by seeing other men.</font>

125
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,761
<font color="yellow">They don't know anything.</font>

126
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,961
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that it isn't the right time.</font>

127
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,761
<font color="yellow">Let's keep it a secret for now.</font>

128
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:05,091
<font color="yellow">Why don't we tell them when we get a chance?</font>

129
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:06,861
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay?</font>

130
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,031
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

131
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,691
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to act cute?</font>

132
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:16,791
<font color="yellow">If not, forget it.</font>

133
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,331
<font color="yellow">Do it one more time.</font>

134
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,431
<font color="yellow">Then I'll consider it.</font>

135
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,891
<font color="yellow">I can't do it again. Forget it.</font>

136
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,661
<font color="yellow">Come on, do it once more.</font>

137
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,391
<font color="yellow">It's because it was so cool.</font>

138
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,161
<font color="yellow">Do it one more time.</font>

139
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:41,131
<font color="yellow">- What? - Act cute like how you did before.</font>

140
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,531
<font color="yellow">I couldn't hear you.</font>

141
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,691
<font color="yellow">Do it one more time. It was so cool.</font>

142
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:47,591
<font color="yellow">Do it one more time, please?</font>

143
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:50,731
<font color="yellow">Please do it just one more time.</font>

144
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,361
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

145
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,731
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

146
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,131
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

147
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,491
<font color="yellow">- Are you just getting off work? - Yes.</font>

148
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,031
<font color="yellow">I almost missed you.</font>

149
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,761
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me in advance?</font>

150
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:09,491
<font color="yellow">I got two tickets to a concert.</font>

151
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,031
<font color="yellow">Remember the CD of mine that you liked?</font>

152
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,591
<font color="yellow">The violinist came to Korea.</font>

153
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,891
<font color="yellow">I wanted to take you to his concert if you were free.</font>

154
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,261
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi.</font>

155
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,031
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm not interested in classical music.</font>

156
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,761
<font color="yellow">I only pretended to like it because of you.</font>

157
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,331
<font color="yellow">I don't even remember that violinist.</font>

158
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,391
<font color="yellow">How about dinner?</font>

159
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,161
<font color="yellow">You need to eat anyway, right?</font>

160
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,631
<font color="yellow">You didn't pretend to like steak when you don't, right?</font>

161
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,431
<font color="yellow">No, I do like steak.</font>

162
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:58,791
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

163
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,561
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

164
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,731
<font color="yellow">Please go ahead and eat.</font>

165
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,231
<font color="yellow">Ah Young, what are you doing this weekend?</font>

166
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:17,031
<font color="yellow">If you're free, let's do something you want to do.</font>

167
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:18,791
<font color="yellow">Not what I want to do.</font>

168
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,361
<font color="yellow">No thank you, Jae Yi.</font>

169
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,531
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep this weekend. I'm tired these days.</font>

170
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:26,331
<font color="yellow">Shall I come to your house?</font>

171
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,231
<font color="yellow">I'll make you spaghetti.</font>

172
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,931
<font color="yellow">You can go back to sleep after eating what I cook for you.</font>

173
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,091
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi.</font>

174
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,091
<font color="yellow">Don't try too hard.</font>

175
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,261
<font color="yellow">It could be worth it, don't you think?</font>

176
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,431
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

177
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,891
<font color="yellow">Trying hard won't make you fall in love with me after 10 years.</font>

178
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,161
<font color="yellow">You can't force someone to fall in love.</font>

179
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,761
<font color="yellow">I know based on experience.</font>

180
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,891
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you guys.</font>

181
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:12,161
<font color="yellow">You're always here. Why don't you switch rooms with me?</font>

182
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,331
<font color="yellow">Getting rid of dead skin is easier in your room.</font>

183
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,691
<font color="yellow">Same here. For some reason, your room is more comfortable.</font>

184
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,461
<font color="yellow">- Is that made with potatoes? - Yes.</font>

185
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:24,231
<font color="yellow">Don't eat it. Yield it to the skin.</font>

186
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,161
<font color="yellow">It's made with flour, potatoes, and honey.</font>

187
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,461
<font color="yellow">It's my special facial mask.</font>

188
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,561
<font color="yellow">It moisturizes and whitens the skin right away.</font>

189
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:39,161
<font color="yellow">How do I look? Doesn't my skin look clear?</font>

190
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,531
<font color="yellow">Wow, your skin got so soft.</font>

191
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:43,631
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try it?</font>

192
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,001
<font color="yellow">I've never done it before.</font>

193
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:47,761
<font color="yellow">Shall I try it for fun?</font>

194
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,501
<font color="yellow">I'll do it for you.</font>

195
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:57,031
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you, Bok Joo?</font>

196
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,961
<font color="yellow">You were never interested in facial masks.</font>

197
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,361
<font color="yellow">It's about time that she changed.</font>

198
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,691
<font color="yellow">If your skin gets clear because of the facial mask,</font>

199
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,891
<font color="yellow">buy me a packet of sausages, okay?</font>

200
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,031
<font color="yellow">- Adjust it so that it fits. - Close your eyes.</font>

201
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,761
<font color="yellow">Take it off after 20 minutes.</font>

202
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,561
<font color="yellow">Don't fall asleep.</font>

203
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,861
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

204
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:14,861
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

205
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:16,991
<font color="yellow">How do you bother to do such a thing every day?</font>

206
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:18,791
<font color="yellow">- For how long? - 20 minutes.</font>

207
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,231
<font color="yellow">- Hold it still. - I'll do it.</font>

208
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:22,261
<font color="yellow">Make it fit on my face.</font>

209
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:24,231
<font color="yellow">Do you do it four times a week?</font>

210
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,531
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

211
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,591
<font color="yellow">Your skin got so young that it's back to adolescent days.</font>

212
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:36,631
<font color="yellow">Why did you get a big pimple at your age?</font>

213
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,561
<font color="yellow">Isn't it because of that facial mask?</font>

214
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,661
<font color="yellow">That's strange. I never had any side effects...</font>

215
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:42,431
<font color="yellow">from the facial mask.</font>

216
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,131
<font color="yellow">You told me to yield it to the skin instead of eating it.</font>

217
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,731
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with the mask on?</font>

218
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,161
<font color="yellow">Did you take it off after 20 minutes?</font>

219
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,631
<font color="yellow">I fell asleep,</font>

220
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,261
<font color="yellow">so I took it off in the early morning.</font>

221
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,891
<font color="yellow">That's why, silly.</font>

222
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:59,161
<font color="yellow">Facial masks are effective only if you put it on for...</font>

223
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,531
<font color="yellow">the right amount of time. Otherwise, it's not worth it.</font>

224
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:03,761
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

225
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:06,791
<font color="yellow">How do I even go outside like this?</font>

226
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:10,091
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal. It's not like you have a boyfriend.</font>

227
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,391
<font color="yellow">Hang in there for a few days.</font>

228
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,261
<font color="yellow">It looks as if you got the pimple...</font>

229
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:16,631
<font color="yellow">because you didn't wash properly.</font>

230
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,961
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it seems dirty.</font>

231
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:24,431
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, weightlifting. - Let's go.</font>

232
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,661
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

233
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:27,891
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

234
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:28,931
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

235
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:31,661
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello, Bok Joo.</font>

236
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:37,061
<font color="yellow">Did you catch a cold?</font>

237
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,631
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

238
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:40,661
<font color="yellow">Is it bad?</font>

239
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,391
<font color="yellow">It's contagious.</font>

240
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,031
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

241
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:52,991
<font color="yellow">You seemed fine yesterday. Are you very sick?</font>

242
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:55,831
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

243
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:00,361
<font color="yellow">I started to cough and got a fever last night.</font>

244
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,731
<font color="yellow">It's tough.</font>

245
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,161
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

246
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,531
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you see a doctor?</font>

247
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:09,491
<font color="yellow">When I have a cold,</font>

248
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,861
<font color="yellow">I cover myself in a blanket and rest.</font>

249
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,231
<font color="yellow">Then I get better.</font>

250
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,391
<font color="yellow">I'll get some rest after training.</font>

251
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,431
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can see you today because I'm sick.</font>

252
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,431
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

253
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,231
<font color="yellow">Take it easy.</font>

254
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:28,931
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again.</font>

255
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,691
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what am I doing?</font>

256
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,261
<font color="yellow">I can't see Joon Hyung because of this huge pimple.</font>

257
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,961
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo.</font>

258
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,131
<font color="yellow">You look like someone from the countryside.</font>

259
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,561
<font color="yellow">One pimple is good enough to make you look silly.</font>

260
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,731
<font color="yellow">Rhinoceros, look away.</font>

261
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:00,531
<font color="yellow">I can't work out because you make me laugh.</font>

262
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,161
<font color="yellow">You look terrible.</font>

263
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,791
<font color="yellow">I have an idea.</font>

264
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,161
<font color="yellow">If you eat a lot of oily food, it'll get inflamed.</font>

265
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,461
<font color="yellow">Why don't you pop it when it does?</font>

266
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:11,761
<font color="yellow">That makes sense.</font>

267
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,831
<font color="yellow">Shall I touch it with my dirty hand?</font>

268
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:15,331
<font color="yellow">You're annoying me. Go away.</font>

269
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,961
<font color="yellow">- Shall I put on some chalk? - Gosh.</font>

270
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,991
<font color="yellow">- It looks terrible. - Go away.</font>

271
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:23,931
<font color="yellow">You're being very considerate.</font>

272
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,831
<font color="yellow">Who has a cold?</font>

273
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,831
<font color="yellow">You came all the way home to get medicine.</font>

274
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,531
<font color="yellow">It's a close friend of mine.</font>

275
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,561
<font color="yellow">- Do you know these are expensive? - Of course.</font>

276
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,661
<font color="yellow">I picked out the herbs myself to give them to you.</font>

277
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,261
<font color="yellow">- Tell your friend not to waste any. - Okay, thank you.</font>

278
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:40,631
<font color="yellow">That's it?</font>

279
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:44,231
<font color="yellow">You haven't kissed me much these days.</font>

280
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:46,431
<font color="yellow">Do you have to be explicit?</font>

281
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,661
<font color="yellow">Ask Dad for the rest.</font>

282
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,431
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - See you.</font>

283
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,931
<font color="yellow">He's so cute.</font>

284
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,131
<font color="yellow">It's suffocating.</font>

285
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,461
<font color="yellow">I can't go to the cafeteria in case I bump into Joon Hyung.</font>

286
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,361
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

287
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:19,031
<font color="yellow">Hello, Joon Hyung.</font>

288
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,461
<font color="yellow">You sound worse.</font>

289
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:23,231
<font color="yellow">Are you in your room?</font>

290
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,161
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

291
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,431
<font color="yellow">I'm in my room.</font>

292
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:28,261
<font color="yellow">Come to the lobby.</font>

293
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,491
<font color="yellow">I brought medicine from home.</font>

294
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:33,391
<font color="yellow">What? No! No, I can't. I mean...</font>

295
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,031
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can.</font>

296
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:41,261
<font color="yellow">My legs are all wobbly because I've been coughing too much.</font>

297
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,731
<font color="yellow">Also, I don't want to get you sick.</font>

298
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,961
<font color="yellow">You're a swimmer.</font>

299
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:50,891
<font color="yellow">That doesn't matter.</font>

300
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:55,161
<font color="yellow">You sound so sick. Can you come down for just a few seconds?</font>

301
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,731
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm too sleepy right now.</font>

302
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,561
<font color="yellow">I should get some sleep.</font>

303
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,731
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

304
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,991
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep. I'll call you later.</font>

305
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,391
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

306
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:14,261
<font color="yellow">Why did he go all the way home for me? I feel terrible.</font>

307
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,991
<font color="yellow">It sounds like her cold is getting worse.</font>

308
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:22,461
<font color="yellow">Taking medication before sleep will help.</font>

309
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,261
<font color="yellow">Can I pop this now?</font>

310
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,591
<font color="yellow">I don't think it has come to a head yet.</font>

311
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,391
<font color="yellow">What if I die from excessive bleeding while popping this pimple?</font>

312
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,091
<font color="yellow">Ouch, it hurts so much. What should I do?</font>

313
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,861
<font color="yellow">Gosh, whatever.</font>

314
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,391
<font color="yellow">You drive me crazy, Bok Joo.</font>

315
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,261
<font color="yellow">A pimple is no big deal. You didn't have to lie.</font>

316
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,361
<font color="yellow">I was so worried about you.</font>

317
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,331
<font color="yellow">I even went home and brought special medicine made by my mom.</font>

318
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,591
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

319
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,531
<font color="yellow">It actually looks a bit funny now that I'm seeing it from up close.</font>

320
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,561
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to cover it? I already saw it. Don't bother.</font>

321
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,591
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want you to see it. I look so ugly now.</font>

322
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,591
<font color="yellow">You're such a girl, Bok Joo.</font>

323
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,431
<font color="yellow">You're seriously so charming.</font>

324
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,561
<font color="yellow">This was fruitful, though.</font>

325
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,201
<font color="yellow">I finally get to see your room.</font>

326
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,491
<font color="yellow">It really is a girl's room. It feels different from my room.</font>

327
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,361
<font color="yellow">You have girly things, too.</font>

328
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,961
<font color="yellow">That's your ex-girlfriend's.</font>

329
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,661
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

330
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,791
<font color="yellow">I was thinking it's not my style.</font>

331
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,891
<font color="yellow">Where's your closet? Is this it?</font>

332
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,201
<font color="yellow">No, no. You can't open it. I didn't organize it.</font>

333
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,061
<font color="yellow">- No, no. - Come on.</font>

334
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,331
<font color="yellow">- I'm messy, too. Let me see. - No, you can't.</font>

335
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,891
<font color="yellow">- No, no, no. - Hey. My gosh!</font>

336
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,231
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing? We can't do this.</font>

337
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,331
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I didn't even do anything.</font>

338
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,261
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, the super supreme family size is here.</font>

339
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,431
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, we're coming in.</font>

340
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:17,761
<font color="yellow">- What were you doing? - I was just stretching.</font>

341
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,561
<font color="yellow">- You must be hungry. Let's eat. - What is that?</font>

342
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:22,591
<font color="yellow">I've been craving this so much. Let's eat.</font>

343
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,231
<font color="yellow">No, eat it in the lounge.</font>

344
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,891
<font color="yellow">I have a roommate, you know. I can't smell up the room.</font>

345
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:29,631
<font color="yellow">Those skinny gymnasts are there. We can just open the window after.</font>

346
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:32,161
<font color="yellow">- Since when did you care? - My goodness. You girls...</font>

347
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,991
<font color="yellow">Hey, sit here. This chair!</font>

348
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,261
<font color="yellow">- Sit here. - Okay.</font>

349
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,631
<font color="yellow">Don't dirty my blanket. It's so clean now...</font>

350
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:40,591
<font color="yellow">- because I just washed it. - My goodness.</font>

351
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,261
<font color="yellow">- What's with you today? - I'm cold.</font>

352
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,761
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat. - Pizza! Let's eat this pizza.</font>

353
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:51,791
<font color="yellow">- Doesn't this look so delicious? - Why can't you eat it in your room?</font>

354
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,661
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to come here?</font>

355
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,631
<font color="yellow">Hey, why aren't you eating? You're underperforming today.</font>

356
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:25,131
<font color="yellow">I know, right? She usually eats two pizzas by herself.</font>

357
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:27,761
<font color="yellow">- I'm just... - Is it because of that huge pimple?</font>

358
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:29,931
<font color="yellow">I'm just feeling a little queasy.</font>

359
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:31,991
<font color="yellow">Is it indigestion? Drink this soda.</font>

360
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,431
<font color="yellow">I want it, too.</font>

361
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:41,531
<font color="yellow">That's delicious.</font>

362
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:43,661
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

363
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:49,091
<font color="yellow">Girls! Seriously. Do you really have...</font>

364
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,231
<font color="yellow">to burp like that? You're disgusting.</font>

365
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,091
<font color="yellow">Who cares? It's just us. I thought it was about something else.</font>

366
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:56,731
<font color="yellow">You burp all the time, too. What's the matter with you?</font>

367
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:59,431
<font color="yellow">Hey, when did I burp?</font>

368
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,731
<font color="yellow">That's not everything. Even after running,</font>

369
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,331
<font color="yellow">she doesn't take a shower.</font>

370
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,431
<font color="yellow">Exactly. Even when she has to wash her hair,</font>

371
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,161
<font color="yellow">she only washes her bangs.</font>

372
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:10,531
<font color="yellow">When did I do that? Take this pizza and go to your room.</font>

373
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:13,201
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

374
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,361
<font color="yellow">We'll finish this quickly and open the window.</font>

375
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,261
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't worry about me and take your time.</font>

376
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:20,661
<font color="yellow">This pizza is so good.</font>

377
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,661
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

378
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,931
<font color="yellow">Girls. I'm sorry to say this,</font>

379
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,861
<font color="yellow">but I feel so tired all of a sudden.</font>

380
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:45,991
<font color="yellow">Can you guys finish soon?</font>

381
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:49,731
<font color="yellow">- All of a sudden? - She said we could stay.</font>

382
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,461
<font color="yellow">You're so erratic.</font>

383
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,931
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Bye, Bok Joo.</font>

384
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,431
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden.</font>

385
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,061
<font color="yellow">Bye, girls. I'm sorry.</font>

386
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,491
<font color="yellow">My goodness, you guys.</font>

387
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,591
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

388
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,091
<font color="yellow">The night view here is amazing.</font>

389
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,091
<font color="yellow">The view from here is better at night. I should've come here sooner.</font>

390
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,761
<font color="yellow">What have I been doing at school?</font>

391
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,261
<font color="yellow">- I didn't know so many things. - Now, you know.</font>

392
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,491
<font color="yellow">Thanks for earlier.</font>

393
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:28,891
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Si Ho. Ta-da!</font>

394
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,261
<font color="yellow">Is that your hiding place?</font>

395
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:34,431
<font color="yellow">Since you're offering it to me, I shall have a sip.</font>

396
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,861
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. - Cheers.</font>

397
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:48,931
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

398
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:52,991
<font color="yellow">But the competition is around the corner, so I should stop now.</font>

399
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:58,631
<font color="yellow">Weightlifting and swimming is much easier than gymnastics.</font>

400
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,761
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be able to live if I had to watch my weight like that.</font>

401
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:05,591
<font color="yellow">You had to put on weight, which is more difficult to do.</font>

402
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,991
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing right now? I'm not used to this.</font>

403
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:12,191
<font color="yellow">What's the problem? We would've been so close if you didn't get involved.</font>

404
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,261
<font color="yellow">Si Ho. When is your competition? We'll be there to cheer you.</font>

405
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,691
<font color="yellow">This weekend.</font>

406
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:20,631
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. We should cheer her. - Hey, we can't.</font>

407
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:23,661
<font color="yellow">- It'd be great if we can be there. - We can't.</font>

408
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,091
<font color="yellow">Why not? It'll make Si Ho so happy.</font>

409
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:27,191
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I should head in now.</font>

410
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:30,691
<font color="yellow">I guess I stayed for too long. Don't stay out until too late.</font>

411
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:33,561
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - See you.</font>

412
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,261
<font color="yellow">Si Ho, are you not going to take that?</font>

413
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,091
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I got to hide in a closet today.</font>

414
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,691
<font color="yellow">We had quite a day today, didn't we?</font>

415
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,861
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

416
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:53,461
<font color="yellow">- did you not wash your hair today? - Hey.</font>

417
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:55,931
<font color="yellow">That was only when I was too tired from the extra training.</font>

418
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,461
<font color="yellow">I'm usually very clean.</font>

419
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:01,731
<font color="yellow">- All right. I'll believe you. - Why do you sound so doubtful?</font>

420
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,991
<font color="yellow">- I am really clean. - Okay.</font>

421
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,491
<font color="yellow">By the way, until when do we have to hide it from everybody?</font>

422
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,761
<font color="yellow">Let's keep it a secret just until the new semester begins.</font>

423
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:17,091
<font color="yellow">Especially your best friend, Tae Kwon. He's dangerous.</font>

424
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,791
<font color="yellow">Be careful, okay?</font>

425
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,931
<font color="yellow">He's a nice guy. Are you badmouthing him or what?</font>

426
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,531
<font color="yellow">I'm just telling you to be careful.</font>

427
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:23,961
<font color="yellow">I'm always careful.</font>

428
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:26,561
<font color="yellow">- Are you getting annoyed with me? - No, I'm not.</font>

429
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,531
<font color="yellow">- I'm always careful. - Do you want to punch me?</font>

430
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:31,391
<font color="yellow">How could I punch you? You're too adorable.</font>

431
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,831
<font color="yellow">My gosh, don't say things like that!</font>

432
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:39,261
<font color="yellow">It makes you look too cute.</font>

433
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:51,791
<font color="yellow">There!</font>

434
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:26,261
<font color="yellow">Are you done with your training?</font>

435
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,231
<font color="yellow">(Are you done with your training?)</font>

436
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:30,731
<font color="yellow">It just ended. I will call you when I go out.</font>

437
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,661
<font color="yellow">(It just ended. I will call you when I go out.)</font>

438
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:41,091
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung. Joon Hyung!</font>

439
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,861
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What is it?</font>

440
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:44,591
<font color="yellow">Hey. It's an emergency.</font>

441
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,991
<font color="yellow">I need you to come with me now.</font>

442
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:49,491
<font color="yellow">- What? Come where? - I'll explain when we get there.</font>

443
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:51,261
<font color="yellow">- Come on now! - My gosh.</font>

444
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,731
<font color="yellow">Hey. Where are you going?</font>

445
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:57,031
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing?</font>

446
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:59,331
<font color="yellow">Listen. She suddenly called me...</font>

447
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,961
<font color="yellow">and said she wanted to see me.</font>

448
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,831
<font color="yellow">She told me to bring you as well.</font>

449
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,491
<font color="yellow">You just left the last time without saying anything.</font>

450
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,591
<font color="yellow">So Hee was so disappointed that you left.</font>

451
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,531
<font color="yellow">She would be upset if I don't bring you.</font>

452
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,061
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I just...</font>

453
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:14,961
<font color="yellow">- can't do this. - Look.</font>

454
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:17,361
<font color="yellow">How can I send away such pretty girls?</font>

455
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:25,561
<font color="yellow">Hi. Gosh, you look even prettier than when I saw you the last time.</font>

456
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,761
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - It's been a long time.</font>

457
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,491
<font color="yellow">Well, yes. Hello.</font>

458
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:30,931
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

459
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,731
<font color="yellow">Did you guys order?</font>

460
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:34,461
<font color="yellow">He's the handsome guy from the swimming team.</font>

461
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:36,031
<font color="yellow">Hyung Chul.</font>

462
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,561
<font color="yellow">What would you like to drink?</font>

463
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,131
<font color="yellow">- Coffee, please. - Me, too.</font>

464
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,261
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll get it for you.</font>

465
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,331
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

466
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,891
<font color="yellow">He said he'd call me when he goes out. Why isn't he calling me?</font>

467
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:58,031
<font color="yellow">Hello, Bok Joo.</font>

468
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:01,091
<font color="yellow">Hey. Where is your dear boyfriend?</font>

469
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:02,861
<font color="yellow">He went to the bathroom.</font>

470
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:04,091
<font color="yellow">He will be here soon.</font>

471
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:06,561
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right. Bok Joo.</font>

472
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,361
<font color="yellow">It's about the guy from the swimming team who put a scarf...</font>

473
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:11,961
<font color="yellow">and a jacket on you.</font>

474
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:13,961
<font color="yellow">You mean Joon Hyung?</font>

475
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,091
<font color="yellow">I guess you two are really just friends.</font>

476
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:19,691
<font color="yellow">I thought there was something between you and him.</font>

477
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,991
<font color="yellow">He was on a blind date at a cafe nearby.</font>

478
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,361
<font color="yellow">A blind date?</font>

479
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:30,091
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

480
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:33,131
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

481
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,891
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. I'm starving.</font>

482
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,861
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to drink coffee?</font>

483
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:40,761
<font color="yellow">You don't even like coffee.</font>

484
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,391
<font color="yellow">And you can just drink from any cafe.</font>

485
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:44,591
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to go around looking for certain coffee?</font>

486
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:46,491
<font color="yellow">They all taste the same.</font>

487
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,331
<font color="yellow">I can't do this. I should go in and eat some tteokbokki or something.</font>

488
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,031
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so hungry.</font>

489
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:56,091
<font color="yellow">What? Aren't those Tae Kwon and Joon Hyung?</font>

490
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,091
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

491
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:02,461
<font color="yellow">She's right. They're obviously on a blind date.</font>

492
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,691
<font color="yellow">What are they doing? Those girls aren't even that pretty.</font>

493
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,461
<font color="yellow">We're much better. Let's go.</font>

494
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,061
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside and watch them.</font>

495
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,561
<font color="yellow">I think this place would make the best coffee.</font>

496
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,791
<font color="yellow">All right. It'll be fun.</font>

497
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,261
<font color="yellow">How spicy?</font>

498
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,131
<font color="yellow">I thought you liked spicy food.</font>

499
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,131
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey. Stop watching and eat first.</font>

500
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,461
<font color="yellow">Eating always comes first.</font>

501
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,661
<font color="yellow">That's right. You should watch with your eyes, and eat with your mouth.</font>

502
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:39,791
<font color="yellow">Look at those girls.</font>

503
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:43,491
<font color="yellow">They're all dressed up. It means they're determined to allure them.</font>

504
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,361
<font color="yellow">Do you see that foxlike girl?</font>

505
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:48,761
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that she's after Joon Hyung.</font>

506
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:50,931
<font color="yellow">I'm not really good at this, but I think so, too.</font>

507
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,331
<font color="yellow">Look at her smiling.</font>

508
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:55,161
<font color="yellow">She's even touching him on the sly.</font>

509
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,161
<font color="yellow">You will die. I will kill you!</font>

510
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,531
<font color="yellow">You'd better finish up within five minutes.</font>

511
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:07,061
<font color="yellow">(You'd better finish up within five minutes.)</font>

512
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:09,661
<font color="yellow">- Look at you two. - Look at you.</font>

513
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:11,961
<font color="yellow">Do you like spicy food?</font>

514
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:14,191
<font color="yellow">I love spicy food.</font>

515
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,731
<font color="yellow">I like eating extremely spicy food while sweating.</font>

516
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:33,791
<font color="yellow">- Look, Tae Kwon. - Yes?</font>

517
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:36,561
<font color="yellow">I think we should hurry up and go.</font>

518
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:38,931
<font color="yellow">I just got...</font>

519
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,661
<font color="yellow">a text message saying all sophomores should gather up now.</font>

520
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,131
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What are you talking about?</font>

521
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,931
<font color="yellow">I'm the leader. I didn't get any messages.</font>

522
00:29:45,691 --> 00:29:47,691
<font color="yellow">No. I did get a message just now.</font>

523
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:50,031
<font color="yellow">- Don't be absurd. - Hey!</font>

524
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,331
<font color="yellow">We're having a tournament soon.</font>

525
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:55,161
<font color="yellow">We should go now and practice.</font>

526
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,861
<font color="yellow">I won't make it to the championship.</font>

527
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,431
<font color="yellow">I messed up at the last tournament.</font>

528
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,761
<font color="yellow">He's just bragging about himself.</font>

529
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,361
<font color="yellow">He sometimes messes up the start,</font>

530
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,591
<font color="yellow">but he's the ace of our team.</font>

531
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,531
<font color="yellow">No wonder. I thought he had the build of Michael Phelps.</font>

532
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:12,691
<font color="yellow">You have such broad shoulders.</font>

533
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:14,761
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

534
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:18,161
<font color="yellow">Your shoulders are so broad.</font>

535
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:20,461
<font color="yellow">- What are you... - They're just so broad.</font>

536
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,831
<font color="yellow">Get that filthy hand off of him.</font>

537
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,791
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

538
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:39,561
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

539
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:42,631
<font color="yellow">I'm the girlfriend of the guy you just touched!</font>

540
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:03,261
<font color="yellow">I just can't believe this.</font>

541
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,791
<font color="yellow">I feel so betrayed, Bok Joo.</font>

542
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:08,061
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

543
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:09,491
<font color="yellow">Since when did you...</font>

544
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,631
<font color="yellow">It's not since we went to the amusement park, is it?</font>

545
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:15,061
<font color="yellow">No. We were just friends back then.</font>

546
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,561
<font color="yellow">I had a crush on Bok Joo then.</font>

547
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:18,691
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

548
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:24,461
<font color="yellow">So since when did you start dating exactly?</font>

549
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:27,631
<font color="yellow">Yesterday? Last week? The week before that?</font>

550
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,861
<font color="yellow">It's the day I came back to school. It was since then.</font>

551
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,861
<font color="yellow">Then when we were on the hunger strike,</font>

552
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:36,261
<font color="yellow">he gave you a scarf and a jacket...</font>

553
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,531
<font color="yellow">I get it now. If I had known,</font>

554
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,791
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been so jealous of her having such a sweet friend.</font>

555
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,591
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

556
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:46,891
<font color="yellow">He gave her such a significant look.</font>

557
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:49,491
<font color="yellow">Why did you keep it a secret from us again?</font>

558
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:51,861
<font color="yellow">You had many chances to tell us the truth.</font>

559
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,031
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you to think of me as a betrayer.</font>

560
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:57,761
<font color="yellow">It also hasn't been that long since I made a fuss about a guy.</font>

561
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:00,261
<font color="yellow">We said it would be a betrayal, but we didn't really mean it.</font>

562
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:01,631
<font color="yellow">How could you secretly date him?</font>

563
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:05,361
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo is such a dishonest girl.</font>

564
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:07,391
<font color="yellow">She keeps lying to us.</font>

565
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:08,761
<font color="yellow">That's not fair.</font>

566
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,361
<font color="yellow">You two kept pressuring her.</font>

567
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:12,661
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo had no choice... - Hey.</font>

568
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,261
<font color="yellow">I guess you're siding with her as her boyfriend,</font>

569
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:16,831
<font color="yellow">but can't you see that it's not the time?</font>

570
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:20,191
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

571
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:24,131
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm so sorry I didn't tell you, guys.</font>

572
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:26,891
<font color="yellow">- Saying you're sorry won't cut it. - Apologizing is not enough.</font>

573
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:28,831
<font color="yellow">What, then?</font>

574
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:32,191
<font color="yellow">Your boyfriend will have to pay for what you've done.</font>

575
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:33,931
<font color="yellow">Think of it as hazing.</font>

576
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:36,161
<font color="yellow">Hazing?</font>

577
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:38,861
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are they going to beat me up?</font>

578
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,891
<font color="yellow">You took away our Bok Joo. You should treat us.</font>

579
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:44,061
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'd love it if you buy us meat.</font>

580
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,791
<font color="yellow">Meat? I see.</font>

581
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,591
<font color="yellow">All right. If I buy you meat,</font>

582
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,731
<font color="yellow">are you going to forgive us?</font>

583
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:53,791
<font color="yellow">Can we now...</font>

584
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,091
<font color="yellow">see each other without sneaking around?</font>

585
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,031
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't buy them meat.</font>

586
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,161
<font color="yellow">Let's go home, Coach Choi.</font>

587
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:13,631
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I feel so tired today.</font>

588
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:14,761
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon.</font>

589
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,491
<font color="yellow">If you don't have any plans,</font>

590
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,091
<font color="yellow">let's have a drink.</font>

591
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,791
<font color="yellow">Can I take a rain check? I'm so tired today.</font>

592
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,891
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

593
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:25,391
<font color="yellow">It has to be today.</font>

594
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:29,461
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Let's go.</font>

595
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:37,761
<font color="yellow">(Weightlifting Team)</font>

596
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:39,461
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

597
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,531
<font color="yellow">I'm right on time, aren't I?</font>

598
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,731
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be getting off work around now.</font>

599
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:46,931
<font color="yellow">Let me take you home.</font>

600
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:50,561
<font color="yellow">I have something I want to talk to Professor Yoon about.</font>

601
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,131
<font color="yellow">I see. Are you going to have a drink?</font>

602
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,331
<font color="yellow">That's great. I wanted to have a drink with Professor Yoon, too.</font>

603
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,931
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat some food and take you home afterwards.</font>

00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:01,531
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho...</font>

605
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,791
<font color="yellow">- Listen, Dae Ho. - Coach Choi.</font>

606
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,961
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to go. I'll see you.</font>

607
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,661
<font color="yellow">No, Professor Yoon. I must tell you today.</font>

608
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:12,531
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Seong Eun?</font>

609
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:14,391
<font color="yellow">You can tell him another day.</font>

610
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:15,731
<font color="yellow">He says he wants to go home.</font>

611
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:17,991
<font color="yellow">- That's... - We can talk another time.</font>

612
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:19,731
<font color="yellow">- I'll go now. - Wait...</font>

613
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,831
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

614
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:23,731
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho.</font>

615
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,261
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

616
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,931
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

617
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,261
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

618
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:33,561
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

619
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:35,231
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon?</font>

620
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:39,261
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

621
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,391
<font color="yellow">We're here, Professor Yoon. Hang in there.</font>

622
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,161
<font color="yellow">Hold on for a second.</font>

623
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,231
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

624
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:50,731
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Take it slow.</font>

625
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:53,191
<font color="yellow">- You're doing great, Professor. - How do I turn on the lights?</font>

626
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:55,791
<font color="yellow">Oh, the lights.</font>

627
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:58,891
<font color="yellow">- Go easy. Easy. - All right.</font>

628
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:01,161
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take one step at a time.</font>

629
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,061
<font color="yellow">You're okay, right?</font>

630
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:04,631
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not okay.</font>

631
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:07,161
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, what should I do? - It's a bit messy...</font>

632
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,331
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it stinks.</font>

633
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,191
<font color="yellow">Wait. Hold on a second.</font>

634
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,761
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

635
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,461
<font color="yellow">I got you.</font>

636
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,531
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

637
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:20,691
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

638
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,961
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it hurts.</font>

639
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,061
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

640
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,761
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

641
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:31,791
<font color="yellow">It'll hurt more when the painkiller wears out. I feel so terrible.</font>

642
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,261
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

643
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,261
<font color="yellow">I didn't break any bones.</font>

644
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,931
<font color="yellow">I'll get better after the weekend.</font>

645
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,331
<font color="yellow">You got a fracture in your tailbone.</font>

646
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,791
<font color="yellow">I can't leave you like this.</font>

647
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,131
<font color="yellow">You can't wash properly and need to eat before taking medicine.</font>

648
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,661
<font color="yellow">- I return with groceries tomorrow. - You'd better not!</font>

649
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,491
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that...</font>

650
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:59,031
<font color="yellow">if a woman visits a man who lives alone, rumors might spread...</font>

651
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,461
<font color="yellow">in the neighborhood.</font>

652
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:03,361
<font color="yellow">I'm completely against the idea.</font>

653
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,661
<font color="yellow">What else can I do?</font>

654
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:07,531
<font color="yellow">He can't even get a glass of water by himself.</font>

655
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:09,261
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

656
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:13,791
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll do it.</font>

657
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,031
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of him.</font>

658
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,391
<font color="yellow">I'll get his groceries and make porridge.</font>

659
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:21,331
<font color="yellow">I'll support him when he goes to the bathroom.</font>

660
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:24,631
<font color="yellow">I might as well sleep here.</font>

661
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:28,101
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about a thing and leave. I'll take care of him.</font>

662
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,601
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

663
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,631
<font color="yellow">I can't eat fast because it's hot.</font>

664
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,101
<font color="yellow">Two more orders of seasoned meat, please.</font>

665
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:44,931
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee, you're eating quickly today.</font>

666
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,931
<font color="yellow">I was hungry because I only had bread today.</font>

667
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:50,101
<font color="yellow">Meat is the best when someone else is buying it.</font>

668
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,791
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Calm down.</font>

669
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:58,831
<font color="yellow">You need to chew more instead of swallowing it.</font>

670
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:01,431
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't you know we have a stomach made of steel?</font>

671
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,391
<font color="yellow">- Stomach made of steel is awesome. - Awesome.</font>

672
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:06,661
<font color="yellow">Isn't the seasoned meat too salty? Do you want some rice?</font>

673
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:08,791
<font color="yellow">You're acting like an amateur.</font>

674
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:12,231
<font color="yellow">We'll fry the rice later. Don't you know it's FSRN?</font>

675
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:15,101
<font color="yellow">What's FSRN?</font>

676
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,891
<font color="yellow">Fresh meat, seasoned meat, rice, and noodles are the basic course meal.</font>

677
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,791
<font color="yellow">I've never had such a meal, but seeing you two eat...</font>

678
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,931
<font color="yellow">awakens my appetite.</font>

679
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,361
<font color="yellow">- You should join us. - Join us.</font>

680
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,261
<font color="yellow">I'm in. Two additional orders of seasoned meat, please.</font>

681
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,991
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - What are you doing?</font>

682
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:35,761
<font color="yellow">Is Bok Joo's boyfriend giving us a look for being tactless?</font>

683
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:38,931
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I won't eat anymore.</font>

684
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,961
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo kept giving me a look, too.</font>

685
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:43,791
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Help yourselves.</font>

686
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,761
<font color="yellow">You should help yourselves.</font>

687
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:47,931
<font color="yellow">You won't get this chance again.</font>

688
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:52,691
<font color="yellow">You already had a lot of fresh and seasoned meat.</font>

689
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:55,031
<font color="yellow">How will you finish fried rice and cold noodles?</font>

690
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:56,791
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Joon Hyung.</font>

691
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,331
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

692
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:00,391
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

693
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,731
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

694
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,661
<font color="yellow">It's 128 dollars.</font>

695
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,131
<font color="yellow">- 128 dollars? - Yes.</font>

696
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,061
<font color="yellow">128...</font>

697
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,431
<font color="yellow">I'll pay with this.</font>

698
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,761
<font color="yellow">Did you get a new mobile phone? It's the new color.</font>

699
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,161
<font color="yellow">Was it expensive?</font>

700
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,691
<font color="yellow">No, it was only half of my monthly allowance.</font>

701
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:33,331
<font color="yellow">Gosh, we should have said we'd treat them next time.</font>

702
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,491
<font color="yellow">I had to treat them at some point.</font>

703
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:37,491
<font color="yellow">I'll consider that today.</font>

704
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:41,761
<font color="yellow">Eating with professional eaters was nice and strategic.</font>

705
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:43,791
<font color="yellow">I ate twice as more than I normally do.</font>

706
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,031
<font color="yellow">Right? I told you.</font>

707
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:48,461
<font color="yellow">- Are we going to karaoke next? - Karaoke?</font>

708
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,961
<font color="yellow">- Karaoke? - Are you being serious?</font>

709
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,961
<font color="yellow">You had a lot of meat already.</font>

710
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,461
<font color="yellow">- Karaoke! - Karaoke!</font>

711
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,691
<font color="yellow">- Karaoke! - We aren't going to karaoke.</font>

<font color="yellow">I have so many questions to ask you.</font>

748
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,731

<font color="yellow">You cunning girl. You won't get any sleep tonight. Let's go.</font>

750
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,431
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

751
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:21,431
<font color="yellow">Tell us how far you two went.</font>

752
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,331

756
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,831
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee asked how far you two went.</font>

757
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,101
<font color="yellow">This is how far we went.</font>

758
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:42,491
<font color="yellow">We went to the movie theater and the sea.</font>

759
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,991
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

760
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,161
<font color="yellow">You two.</font>

761
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:50,691
<font color="yellow">Did you two kiss? There's no way you didn't.</font>

762
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:53,461
<font color="yellow">That's private. I won't make any comment.</font>

763
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:56,931
<font color="yellow">They definitely did it. My goodness.</font>

764
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:00,391
<font color="yellow">I can't imagine Bok Joo and Joon Hyung kissing.</font>

765
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,361
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be jealous.</font>

766
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,601
<font color="yellow">I don't want to admit it, but I'm really jealous.</font>

767
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,931
<font color="yellow">When did you kiss? Where and how did it happen?</font>

768
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,561
<font color="yellow">Tell us in detail.</font>

769
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,231
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the first or the second?</font>

770
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,391
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

771
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:23,601
<font color="yellow">- Why you... - Goodness.</font>

772
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,161
<font color="yellow">You're the ones who asked.</font>

773
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:27,231
<font color="yellow">Look at her bragging.</font>

774
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,631
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous of you.</font>

775
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:31,601
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh!</font>

776
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,531
<font color="yellow">Come to your senses.</font>

777
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:37,691
<font color="yellow">You're basically destroying yourself. Don't live that way.</font>

778
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:40,131
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Bok Joo?</font>

779
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:43,561
<font color="yellow">I also really like her. She has a great personality.</font>

780
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:46,261
<font color="yellow">However, your girlfriend is a completely different matter...</font>

781
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:47,891
<font color="yellow">from someone with a great personality.</font>

782
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,431
<font color="yellow">More than anything,</font>

783
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,191
<font color="yellow">she eats too much, and she's too strong.</font>

784
00:43:54,191 --> 00:43:55,391
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

785
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:57,231
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

786
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,431
<font color="yellow">she's sexier that way.</font>

787
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:01,191
<font color="yellow">Sexy?</font>

788
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:04,261
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy. This is game over.</font>

789
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:07,861
<font color="yellow">You're head over heels for her, aren't you?</font>

790
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:25,261
<font color="yellow">Is your competition today? How do you feel?</font>

791
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:27,561
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

792
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,391
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm not.</font>

793
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,031
<font color="yellow">I've competed a lot since I was a child.</font>

794
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:36,361
<font color="yellow">I'm the most nervous today.</font>

795
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:39,931
<font color="yellow">Do you have a moment?</font>

796
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:46,191
<font color="yellow">I don't show it to anyone.</font>

797
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:48,191
<font color="yellow">I'm showing it to you since today is special.</font>

798
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,361
<font color="yellow">Make your wish.</font>

799
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,031
<font color="yellow">- Does it grant your wish? - Of course.</font>

800
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,891
<font color="yellow">I always pray here before competitions.</font>

801
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,331
<font color="yellow">- I won, remember? - Okay.</font>

802
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,761
<font color="yellow">Do you feel much better?</font>

803
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:16,191
<font color="yellow">- Did you wish for the nationals? - No.</font>

804
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:18,231
<font color="yellow">I wished for a competition without regrets.</font>

805
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:23,131
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung and I will come see you at the competition. You can do it.</font>

806
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:25,491
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you guys if things go well.</font>

807
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:26,861
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

808
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:28,791
<font color="yellow">I should be gentle because you're so delicate.</font>

809
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:37,161
<font color="yellow">You should eat.</font>

810
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,261
<font color="yellow">Come on. This is a pretty good meal.</font>

811
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:46,031
<font color="yellow">Did you expect a feast or what?</font>

812
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,191
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

813
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:52,331
<font color="yellow">I can't eat eggs without ketchup.</font>

814
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,031
<font color="yellow">Come again?</font>

815
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:55,831
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

816
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:57,691
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat it.</font>

817
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:32,131
<font color="yellow">I should go get a new one.</font>

818
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:34,431
<font color="yellow">Here. Take this.</font>

819
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:36,331
<font color="yellow">I have money.</font>

820
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:49,391
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

821
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:53,491
<font color="yellow">Can you... Can you also get mayonnaise?</font>

822
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:57,331
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

823
00:46:59,861 --> 00:47:01,031
<font color="yellow">The door was open.</font>

824
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:07,831
<font color="yellow">Is he a kid or what?</font>

825
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,031
<font color="yellow">Why can't he eat eggs without ketchup?</font>

826
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:20,431
<font color="yellow">- It's so cold. - Just stay still.</font>

827
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,531
<font color="yellow">Warm compresses will help you recover quickly.</font>

828
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,031
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's okay.</font>

829
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,931
<font color="yellow">I'll do it later, so don't worry about it.</font>

830
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:28,431
<font color="yellow">You should leave.</font>

831
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:30,561
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho is right.</font>

832
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:33,791
<font color="yellow">People will get the wrong idea if they see you here. Get going now.</font>

833
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:34,961
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

834
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,131
<font color="yellow">Who cares about what people think?</font>

835
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,831
<font color="yellow">You know...</font>

836
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:47,531
<font color="yellow">that I've had...</font>

837
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:51,231
<font color="yellow">a crush on you for a long time.</font>

838
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,431
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

839
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:58,761
<font color="yellow">Why would you?</font>

840
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:01,461
<font color="yellow">Why on earth would a woman like you have a crush...</font>

841
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:05,531
<font color="yellow">- on an old divorced man? - Don't think about those things.</font>

842
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,361
<font color="yellow">As a woman,</font>

843
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:11,031
<font color="yellow">what do you think of me?</font>

844
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:15,131
<font color="yellow">Is that a no?</font>

845
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:18,991
<font color="yellow">You don't find me attractive at all?</font>

846
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:32,731
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

847
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,361
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

848
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:37,831
<font color="yellow">I will never...</font>

849
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:41,461
<font color="yellow">put you in an awkward position again.</font>

850
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:42,761
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

851
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:01,191
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

852
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,761
<font color="yellow">- Gosh... - Are you all right?</font>

853
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:06,691
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that? - Leave it. I'm okay. Gosh...</font>

854
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,191
<font color="yellow">It's my fault, isn't it? I'm sorry.</font>

855
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:11,191
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

856
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:41,961
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so nervous for her.</font>

857
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:43,491
<font color="yellow">I hope Si Ho does a good job today.</font>

858

860
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:53,261
<font color="yellow">Are you being sarcastic? You're mocking me now, aren't you?</font>

861
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,431
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

862
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:58,331
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying that you girls are very broad-minded.</font>

863
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:00,791
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm so happy.</font>

864
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,661
<font color="yellow">We no longer have to see each other in secret.</font>

865
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,261
<font color="yellow">We should've told everyone a long time ago.</font>

866
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:08,031
<font color="yellow">How can you say that? They gave you such a hard time yesterday.</font>

867
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,061
<font color="yellow">Exactly. I've paid my dues,</font>

868
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:11,931
<font color="yellow">so I can now be open about how much I like you.</font>

869

872

<font color="yellow">"Did she threaten Joon Hyung?"</font>

873

<font color="yellow">"Bok Joo hit the jackpot."</font>

874
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:27,091
<font color="yellow">"She's not good enough for Joon Hyung." They will go on about it.</font>

875
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,491
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't say that.</font>

876
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:29,961
<font color="yellow">You're such a pretty girl.</font>

877
