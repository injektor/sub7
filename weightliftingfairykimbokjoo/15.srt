<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,730
<font color="yellow">Can you recognize me?</font>

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,660
<font color="yellow">It's me, Mom.</font>

8
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,460
<font color="yellow">Are you really Joon Hyung?</font>

9
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,690
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

10
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,960
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to know...</font>

11
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,290
<font color="yellow">how you'd turn out after growing up.</font>

12
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,530
<font color="yellow">You grew up to be much better than I thought.</font>

13
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,860
<font color="yellow">I wonder if...</font>

14
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,160
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung met his mom by now.</font>

15
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,930
<font color="yellow">I think so. She went to his school today.</font>

16
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,090
<font color="yellow">I hope she doesn't mention the postcards.</font>

17
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,390
<font color="yellow">I begged her not to.</font>

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,090
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung's mom isn't dumb.</font>

19
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,790
<font color="yellow">Why would she mention that? It'd only hurt Joon Hyung.</font>

20
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,530
<font color="yellow">I wonder if she'll recognize him.</font>

21
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,290
<font color="yellow">I don't know the area.</font>

22
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,860
<font color="yellow">I got lost, so I asked someone.</font>

23
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,230
<font color="yellow">Coincidentally, she turned out to be your friend.</font>

24
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,060
<font color="yellow">Are you very close to her?</font>

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,630
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,060
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

27
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,930
<font color="yellow">- If you're hungry, let's get... - No.</font>

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry.</font>

29
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,530
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,390
<font color="yellow">How's swimming?</font>

31
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,060
<font color="yellow">Isn't it difficult?</font>

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,690
<font color="yellow">Is it okay?</font>

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, I guess.</font>

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,160
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

35
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,130
<font color="yellow">I have this.</font>

36
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,960
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,390
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what you needed.</font>

38
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,260
<font color="yellow">It's a pair of sneakers.</font>

39
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,730
<font color="yellow">I thought you could use a pair.</font>

40
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,560
<font color="yellow">I hope they fit you.</font>

41
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,330
<font color="yellow">I guessed your size.</font>

42
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,390
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

43
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,590
<font color="yellow">I'll make good use of them.</font>

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,430
<font color="yellow">While buying the present,</font>

45
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,160
<font color="yellow">I thought about you very much.</font>

46
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,330
<font color="yellow">I wondered how much taller you got.</font>

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,990
<font color="yellow">I wondered how your face changed.</font>

50
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,490
<font color="yellow">I should have come earlier to see you.</font>

51

57
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,660
<font color="yellow">It's very delicious.</font>

58
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,990
<font color="yellow">Your cooking is amazing as always.</font>

59
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,930

<font color="yellow">The fish is very plump.</font>

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,460
<font color="yellow">You made a great choice.</font>

64
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,800
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

65
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,460

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,830
<font color="yellow">Mom. Water, please.</font>

67
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,930
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

68
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,160
<font color="yellow">Pardon me.</font>

69
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,460
<font color="yellow">You can give it to him.</font>

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

71
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,860

73
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

74
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,560
<font color="yellow">I can catch the taxi by myself.</font>

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,690

<font color="yellow">Before I leave,</font>

79
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,090
<font color="yellow">I want to make you a meal.</font>

80
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,630
<font color="yellow">- If you aren't free... - I'll come.</font>

<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow, my son.</font>

84
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,560

85
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

86
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,730
<font color="yellow">You look happy.</font>

87
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,160
<font color="yellow">How was it with your mom?</font>

88
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,460
<font color="yellow">There's not much to say.</font>

89
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,330
<font color="yellow">Yes, there is. You look much happier than before.</font>

90
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,390
<font color="yellow">Is it obvious?</font>

91
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,090
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's very obvious.</font>

92
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,860
<font color="yellow">What did you do with your mom?</font>

93
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,160
<font color="yellow">We went home and had dinner.</font>

94
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,060
<font color="yellow">I walked her to the taxi home.</font>

95
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,860
<font color="yellow">That's it?</font>

96
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,130
<font color="yellow">I'll go see her again tomorrow.</font>

97
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,490
<font color="yellow">What else?</font>

98
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,760
<font color="yellow">I held my mom's hand.</font>

99
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,460
<font color="yellow">It was very warm.</font>

100
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,290
<font color="yellow">I'm getting jealous, but I'll let it go this time...</font>

101
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,460
<font color="yellow">since she's your mom.</font>

102
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,400
<font color="yellow">I think your mom missed you very much.</font>

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,690
<font color="yellow">She came all the way here from Canada.</font>

104
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,690
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

105
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,990
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't she want to see a handsome son like me?</font>

106
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,400
<font color="yellow">You seem very confident after seeing your mom.</font>

107
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,590
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be jealous.</font>

108
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,690
<font color="yellow">I'd love to have a mom who came to visit me at school.</font>

109
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,560
<font color="yellow">You have a dad who supports you.</font>

110
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,030
<font color="yellow">You also have a great uncle.</font>

111
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,530
<font color="yellow">More importantly, you have me.</font>

112
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,330
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
<font color="yellow">I forgot about that.</font>

114
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,130
<font color="yellow">Is it Spring Residence room number 1803?</font>

115
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,930
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving now. It'll take about 30 minutes.</font>

116
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,160
<font color="yellow">Okay, see you soon.</font>

117
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,900
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

118
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,400
<font color="yellow">can you bring a photo album if you have one?</font>

119
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,130
<font color="yellow">I want to see your photos...</font>

120
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,090
<font color="yellow">when you were young.</font>

121
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,900
<font color="yellow">I'll bring some from home.</font>

122
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,490
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you later.</font>

123
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's too small.</font>

124
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,830
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to squeeze my feet into them.</font>

125
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,160
<font color="yellow">I sent 10,000 dollars to Mom's bank account.</font>

126
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,960
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

127
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,960
<font color="yellow">If I put that together with the money I have,</font>

128
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,060
<font color="yellow">it'd be 20,000 dollars.</font>

129
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'm sure you need money for other things, too.</font>

130
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's not like I need the money right now.</font>

131
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,160
<font color="yellow">By the way, is her child in a serious condition?</font>

132
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,360
<font color="yellow">Can she get her child a surgery if she goes back with the money?</font>

133
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

134
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,260
<font color="yellow">She has to get enough money for the surgery first.</font>

135
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,230
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that...</font>

136
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,790
<font color="yellow">her young child got a rare disease.</font>

137
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,990
<font color="yellow">I guess she thought her brother could give her the money,</font>

138
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,030
<font color="yellow">but selling land takes time.</font>

139
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,860
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have asked us for money if she had a choice.</font>

140
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,030
<font color="yellow">What money?</font>

141
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,360
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

142
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,060
<font color="yellow">When did you get here? We didn't hear you come in.</font>

143
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,030
<font color="yellow">Money?</font>

144
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,460
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

145
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,160
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung. Let's sit down and...</font>

146
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,990
<font color="yellow">Is my mom here for money?</font>

147
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,960
<font color="yellow">Did she need money?</font>

148
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,890
<font color="yellow">Is that why she suddenly...</font>

149
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,360
<font color="yellow">But why is she...</font>

150
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,490
<font color="yellow">asking you for the money?</font>

151
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,330
<font color="yellow">She should be grateful that you've fed me and raised me so far.</font>

152
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,930
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

153
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,790
<font color="yellow">How could she ask you two for such a favor?</font>

154
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,360
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung. It's not that. She had a reason for it.</font>

155
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,330
<font color="yellow">Even if she did, this is not right.</font>

156
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,790
<font color="yellow">It's so brazen to do that.</font>

157

309
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,390

<font color="yellow">Hey, his family owns a pharmacy.</font>

317
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,230
<font color="yellow">Why would a pharmacy go bankrupt?</font>

318
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,860

320

333
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,630

<font color="yellow">Hey, Ye Bin.</font>

335
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,690
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You can dislocate your shoulders that way.</font>

336
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,530
<font color="yellow">Watch your shoulders.</font>

337

341
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,060
<font color="yellow">I actually heard you went through a slump after winning the match.</font>

342
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,560
<font color="yellow">May I ask you how you managed to overcome it?</font>

343
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,160
<font color="yellow">I took some time off from training and did a lot of thinking.</font>

344
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,260
<font color="yellow">I also got help from people around me.</font>

345

374
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,430

390
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,590
<font color="yellow">I think I'm a little too old to be called cute.</font>

391
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,160
<font color="yellow">But you are really cute.</font>

392

<font color="yellow">No, my brother owns it.</font>

397
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,630
<font color="yellow">I'm actually an actor. I've only played minor roles, though.</font>

398

399
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,860
<font color="yellow">Oh, you know. I played one of the crewmen...</font>

400
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,390

405

<font color="yellow">That scene was so scary.</font>

406
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,590
<font color="yellow">That wasn't even one of my best performances.</font>

407

<font color="yellow">Thanks for remembering it.</font>

408
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,230

409
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,660
<font color="yellow">I was so impressed by it.</font>

410
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,130

612
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,560

622
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,230
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

628
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,930
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's enough to smash this desk, though.</font>

629
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,560
<font color="yellow">What brings you here? When did you get here?</font>

630
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,530
<font color="yellow">I was in the area,</font>

631
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,590
<font color="yellow">so I thought I should just stop by.</font>

632
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,590
<font color="yellow">You probably won't believe that.</font>

633

<font color="yellow">Let's go grab some food.</font>

639
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,330
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

640
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,390
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here for food?</font>

641
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:08,830
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

642
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,030

645
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,330
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - He's so good-looking.</font>

646
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,160
<font color="yellow">- He's so handsome. - That must be his girlfriend.</font>

647
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,130
<font color="yellow">- Whatever. He's seriously so cute. - I'm really jealous.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hey, ouch. What are you doing?</font>

651
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,560
<font color="yellow">You have to cover your face as much as possible from now on, okay?</font>

652
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,730
<font color="yellow">Nothing can really mask my good looks, all right?</font>

653
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,760
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to be this handsome?</font>

654
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,260
<font color="yellow">How about you shave your head?</font>

655
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,060
<font color="yellow">I'll do it if you want me to.</font>

656
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,060
<font color="yellow">I can't go away...</font>

657
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,630

<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung,</font>

659
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,330
<font color="yellow">I haven't told you because I didn't want to upset you.</font>

660
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,790

00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,590
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

666
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,090
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

667
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,260
<font color="yellow">Really? My gosh...</font>

668
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,160
<font color="yellow">Hey, congratulations.</font>

669
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,160
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to do that with those heavy weights?</font>

670
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,390
<font color="yellow">I'm more amazed by you because you can float in water.</font>

671
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,260
<font color="yellow">You're not sad about it?</font>

672
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,890
<font color="yellow">We just started going out, and we'll be a long-distance couple now.</font>

673

<font color="yellow">I won't be able to visit you often.</font>

674
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,830
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll follow you there soon.</font>

675

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

676
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,730
<font color="yellow">I have a match next week.</font>

677
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,430
<font color="yellow">They'll pick members for the national team, too.</font>

678
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,990
<font color="yellow">If I win the first place, I can go straight to Taereung.</font>

679
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,330
<font color="yellow">We also have a world championship tournament coming up.</font>

680
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,360
<font color="yellow">Seriously? Can you really join the national team if you win the match?</font>

681
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,390
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

682
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,360
<font color="yellow">If I get the second place, they'll take a look at my previous scores.</font>

683
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,130
<font color="yellow">But if I win the first place, I can join the national team immediately.</font>

684
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,260
<font color="yellow">I was going to take it a little easy this time,</font>

685
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,690
<font color="yellow">but I feel my competitive juices starting to flow all of a sudden.</font>

686
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,990
<font color="yellow">Are you confident that you can win?</font>

687
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,330
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

688
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,860
<font color="yellow">I can beat anyone in the world if my trauma doesn't get in the way.</font>

689
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,430
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, I really want to go to Taereung with you.</font>

690
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,360
<font color="yellow">- Let's go together. - Don't you worry.</font>

691
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,560
<font color="yellow">I'm going to beat everyone at the match.</font>

692
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,330
<font color="yellow">I'll follow you there shortly, okay?</font>

693
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,590
<font color="yellow">I really want us to go to Taereung together. Please.</font>

694

<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

695
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, I don't need extra training right away.</font>

696
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,560

698
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,160
<font color="yellow">Come on. Start with running. Hurry up.</font>

699
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,230

<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

704
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,630

<font color="yellow">One, two. The pace is great!</font>

707
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,660
<font color="yellow">Keep going, guys.</font>

708
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,630
<font color="yellow">One, two. Great.</font>

709
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,760
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, you seem to be in a great shape. Good job.</font>

710
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,960
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you really make this?</font>

711
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,860
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

712
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,130
<font color="yellow">I'm happy to see you enjoying it.</font>

713
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,990
<font color="yellow">Hey, go run now if you're done. Hurry up.</font>

714
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,730
<font color="yellow">I just ate. Running immediately after eating causes stomach pain.</font>

715
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,160
<font color="yellow">- I can't. I can't run now. - Come on!</font>

716
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,030
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I won't run.</font>

717
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,690
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Go run now. You're totally fine.</font>

718
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,990
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Come on. Start running, will you?</font>

719
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,560
<font color="yellow">I'll run if you kiss me.</font>

720

00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,530
<font color="yellow">Go and run first.</font>

00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,330
<font color="yellow">and Jeong Joon Hyung won the second place by a nose.</font>

760
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. Joon Hyung was amazing.</font>

761
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,860
<font color="yellow">This is Kim Chang Geol.</font>

762
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,930
<font color="yellow">Pardon? A donor?</font>

763
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,060
<font color="yellow">I see. I can't go in today,</font>

764
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,790
<font color="yellow">but I can go to the hospital tomorrow.</font>

765
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,390
<font color="yellow">All right. Okay. I'll go to the hospital tomorrow afternoon.</font>

766
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,590
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

767
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,960
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do they want you to have the surgery?</font>

768
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,630
<font color="yellow">Did they find a donor?</font>

769
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,260
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm the second one on the list, but they said...</font>

770
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,960
<font color="yellow">there's still a chance.</font>

771
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,890
<font color="yellow">They set up additional tests for me and want me to come in today.</font>

772
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you say you'll go tomorrow?</font>

773
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,330
<font color="yellow">You should go when they ask you to.</font>

774
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,760
<font color="yellow">You brat. I should go after Bok Joo goes into Taereung.</font>

775
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,990
<font color="yellow">If I say I have to go to the hospital, she would be worried.</font>

776
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,330
<font color="yellow">You can't hide this from her.</font>

777
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,960
<font color="yellow">Even if I get the surgery, I won't tell her until they set the date.</font>

778
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,260
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'll tell her after setting the date.</font>

779
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,660
<font color="yellow">I still think you should tell her.</font>

780
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,630
<font color="yellow">What if she gets mad at me later because of this?</font>

781
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,990
<font color="yellow">You did great. You were the best, Joon Hyung.</font>

782
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:49,130
<font color="yellow">I could have won if my arms were a little bit longer.</font>

783
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,830
<font color="yellow">I wanted to win and go into Taereung with you.</font>

784
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,090
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. You couldn't have done it better.</font>

785
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,960
<font color="yellow">You completely overcame your trauma.</font>

786
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,930
<font color="yellow">You're going to win the first place next time.</font>

787
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,930
<font color="yellow">You're only going to get better.</font>

788
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,730
<font color="yellow">You'll be leaving...</font>

789
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,290
<font color="yellow">in 13 hours 26 minutes...</font>

790
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,990
<font color="yellow">and 15 seconds. 14 seconds.</font>

791
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,160
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. I'm not sure I'll be okay if I don't see you.</font>

792
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,260
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who is more worried.</font>

793
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,790
<font color="yellow">You made me get addicted to you without realizing.</font>

794
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,930
<font color="yellow">I know I have deadly charms.</font>

795
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,660
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't run away from there because you miss me,</font>

796
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,630
<font color="yellow">so I will follow you in there soon.</font>

797
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,160
<font color="yellow">If you break up with me and start seeing someone else, I'll kill you.</font>

798
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,030
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say.</font>

799
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,660
<font color="yellow">I already asked Seon Ok and Nan Hee to keep an eye on you.</font>

800
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,030
<font color="yellow">Those girls.</font>

801
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,060
<font color="yellow">They ruined everything.</font>

802
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,490
<font color="yellow">What time are you leaving tomorrow? Let me see you off.</font>

803
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,990
<font color="yellow">No. I'll go by myself.</font>

804
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,430
<font color="yellow">You said you'll join me soon.</font>

805
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,090
<font color="yellow">You don't have time to see me off. You should train hard.</font>

806
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:11,590
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You already sound so proud of being a national athlete.</font>

807
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,430
<font color="yellow">Now I have to go into Taereung.</font>

808
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,560
<font color="yellow">Please do. No one is stopping you.</font>

809
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,090
<font color="yellow">When you're free, please visit my dad's restaurant.</font>

810
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,390
<font color="yellow">My uncle takes care of him, but I'm still worried.</font>

811
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,730
<font color="yellow">Okay. You can trust me.</font>

812
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,830
<font color="yellow">We only have 13 hours 22 minutes...</font>

813
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,360
<font color="yellow">12 seconds. 11 seconds.</font>

814
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,390
<font color="yellow">Hello, Nan Hee?</font>

815
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,660
<font color="yellow">Your uniform? Why do you want me to bring it?</font>

816
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,890
<font color="yellow">Well... Yes, I am outside. Fine.</font>

817
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,830
<font color="yellow">I'll drop by the gym. I'll see you later. Okay.</font>

818
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,430
<font color="yellow">- Do your friends need something? - Yes.</font>

819
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,230
<font color="yellow">- I should drop by the gym. - Okay. Let's go.</font>

820
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:04,360
<font color="yellow">What? Why is it so dark? Why are all lights turned off?</font>

821
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,430
<font color="yellow">Hey. This is a chance.</font>

822
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,060
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

823
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,430
<font color="yellow">No. What if someone walks in?</font>

824
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,960
<font color="yellow">No one would walk in. There's nobody here.</font>

825
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,330
<font color="yellow">- Surprise! - Surprise!</font>

826
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,760
<font color="yellow">Here, Bok Joo. Let me pour you one.</font>

827
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, Professor.</font>

828
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,230
<font color="yellow">I told the coach at Taereung...</font>

829
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,660
<font color="yellow">to take good care of my special pupil.</font>

830
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,360
<font color="yellow">You should try not to hurt your back in particular.</font>

831
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,560
<font color="yellow">- You have to take care of yourself. - Yes, Coach.</font>

832
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,830
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

833
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,030
<font color="yellow">I couldn't have done it without your help.</font>

834
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,260
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what's wrong? It's not like we will never see her again.</font>

835
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,530
<font color="yellow">It's true that we won't be seeing her for a while.</font>

836
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,360
<font color="yellow">She won't be here for the jog, lunch,</font>

837
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,260
<font color="yellow">and training for snatch, clean and jerk.</font>

839
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,960

840
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,930

841
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,560
<font color="yellow">for a while. What's your name?</font>

842

846
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,360

847
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,430
<font color="yellow">He reminds me of myself when I was 20 years old.</font>

848
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,430
<font color="yellow">I used to look like that.</font>

849

852
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,390
<font color="yellow">All right. Bok Joo, I hope your training goes well at Taereung,</font>

853
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,460
<font color="yellow">and you will raise Korean weightlifting's prestige in China.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Cheers, Bok Joo. - It's delicious.</font>

858
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,960
<font color="yellow">- Can we eat now? - Go ahead.</font>

859
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,160
