<font color="yellow">At first, it gets harder to get him on the phone.</font>

119
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:38,157
<font color="yellow">He either ignores your call, or says he'll call back later. Then,</font>

120
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:41,157
<font color="yellow">he will sound aloof, and his answers will be very short.</font>

121
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,857
<font color="yellow">And finally, he will drop the bomb.</font>

134

00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:12,787
<font color="yellow">I have no idea. He said he had to go somewhere.</font>

153
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:15,987
<font color="yellow">What is Joon Hyung up to these days?</font>

154
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:18,657
<font color="yellow">Do you also suspect that he's with another woman?</font>

155
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:22,187
<font color="yellow">I don't want to suspect him, but that's the feeling I get.</font>

156
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,187
<font color="yellow">What else could it be other than women?</font>

157
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,687
<font color="yellow">Listen, Joon Hyung tends to have...</font>

158
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,587
<font color="yellow">many women around him,</font>

159
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,587
<font color="yellow">but he's not the type to betray.</font>

160
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,327
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

161
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,757
<font color="yellow">As a man, I can't guarantee it.</font>

162
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:36,057
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

163
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,387
<font color="yellow">We need evidence to catch him...</font>

164
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,757
<font color="yellow">or to straighten out any misunderstanding.</font>

165
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,687
<font color="yellow">Tae Kwon, we need your cooperation.</font>

166
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,557
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

167
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:51,657
<font color="yellow">My niece's future husband.</font>

168
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,987
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I can ask this,</font>

169
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,987
<font color="yellow">but can you come for two hours tomorrow?</font>

170
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:00,257
<font color="yellow">My girlfriend is very upset right now.</font>

171
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,687
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

172
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,187
<font color="yellow">I'll come after my training.</font>

173
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:10,757
<font color="yellow">Could you let me go?</font>

174
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:17,187
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Honey? - Aren't you coming?</font>

175
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,527
<font color="yellow">- Where are you, you jerk? - Why are you cursing at me?</font>

176
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,297
<font color="yellow">You're the most beautiful when you curse.</font>

177
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,687
<font color="yellow">- Keep up with the compliments. - You're so cool.</font>

178
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:28,027
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering me?</font>

179
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,327
<font color="yellow">Who are you with? Which girl?</font>

180
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,357
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to answer me?</font>

181
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:35,257
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed...</font>

182
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:37,087
<font color="yellow">She's not picking up.</font>

183
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:39,157
<font color="yellow">Is she in training?</font>

184
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,357
<font color="yellow">Why did she call me at that moment?</font>

185
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:45,927
<font color="yellow">I want to hear your voice, Bok Joo.</font>

186
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,457
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

187
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,797
<font color="yellow">Look who it is. It's Si Ho.</font>

188
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,297
<font color="yellow">- Have you been well? - I've been okay.</font>

189
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,427
<font color="yellow">Gosh, where are you going?</font>

190
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:58,987
<font color="yellow">I'm heading to the dorm, and you?</font>

191
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,797
<font color="yellow">I'm heading there, too. Let's go together.</font>

192
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,887
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead first. - Let's go together.</font>

193
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,297
<font color="yellow">No, go ahead first.</font>

194
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,657
<font color="yellow">Stop playing. Let's go.</font>

195
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:07,757
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

196
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,527
<font color="yellow">How's the therapy session?</font>

197
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,297
<font color="yellow">- Isn't the doctor great? - Yes.</font>

198
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,727
<font color="yellow">I've been feeling much better ever since the therapy.</font>

199
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,887
<font color="yellow">I'm studying these days.</font>

200
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,227
<font color="yellow">I'm being interviewed for assistant coach positions.</font>

201
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,957
<font color="yellow">You're working hard.</font>

202
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,527
<font color="yellow">You look much better, too.</font>

203
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,057
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

204
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:34,227
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you in touch with Bok Joo often?</font>

205
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,087
<font color="yellow">Isn't it difficult because she's in Taereung?</font>

206
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:42,187
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to resent the national team.</font>

207
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,157
<font color="yellow">(Haneol Sport University)</font>

208
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,427
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

209
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:15,157
<font color="yellow">Gosh, see you there.</font>

210
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,857
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee, we've got one.</font>

211
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,587
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung is out again.</font>

212
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:21,727
<font color="yellow">We have to go now.</font>

213
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,027
<font color="yellow">Okay, Joon Hyung is dead meat.</font>

214
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,557
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

215
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,287
<font color="yellow">He's walking so fast. He must be excited.</font>

216
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,287
<font color="yellow">I hope he's not seeing another woman.</font>

217
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,957
<font color="yellow">If so, I'll grab him by the collar.</font>

218
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,887
<font color="yellow">It has to be another woman.</font>

219
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:43,657
<font color="yellow">I'm sure of it.</font>

220
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,457
<font color="yellow">I thought he was more faithful than that.</font>

221
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:48,787
<font color="yellow">- I'm nothing without my fidelity. - Be quiet.</font>

222
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:50,857
<font color="yellow">We must catch him in the act,</font>

223
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,627
<font color="yellow">so be discreet as possible.</font>

224
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,527
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

225
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,757
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

226
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,387
<font color="yellow">Is he visiting someone at the hospital?</font>

227
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:31,227
<font color="yellow">Perhaps.</font>

228
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,827
<font color="yellow">Is the woman hospitalized?</font>

229
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,857
<font color="yellow">Could it be...</font>

230
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:37,787
<font color="yellow">a nurse?</font>

231
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,787
<font color="yellow">We can't go into someone's room in the hospital.</font>

232
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:47,957
<font color="yellow">We must catch him in the act of cheating.</font>

233
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,187
<font color="yellow">Kim Chang Geol? The name sounds familiar.</font>

234
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,827
<font color="yellow">Do you know Kim Chang Geol?</font>

235
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:55,157
<font color="yellow">Kim Chang Geol?</font>

236
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:58,887
<font color="yellow">It's the same as the name of Bok Joo's father.</font>

237
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,787
<font color="yellow">Right, her father's name is...</font>

238
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,687
<font color="yellow">No, that can't be.</font>

239
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:08,057
<font color="yellow">What? What do you think it is?</font>

240
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,557
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, these are delicious. - Aren't they?</font>

241
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,127
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee, Seon Ok.</font>

242
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,187
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

243
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,257
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim. - Mr. Kim.</font>

244
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:21,057
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim? - Hey.</font>

245
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,457
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you guys the more I think about it.</font>

246
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,027
<font color="yellow">- Especially you, Tae Kwon. - Yes?</font>

247
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,987
<font color="yellow">Are you friends with me or with them?</font>

248
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:44,787
<font color="yellow">How could you suspect me and spy on me?</font>

249
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,927
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a choice.</font>

250
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,327
<font color="yellow">He didn't do anything wrong. It's us who overreacted.</font>

251
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,327
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo was sad that she couldn't get a hold of you,</font>

252
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,987
<font color="yellow">so I lost my temper.</font>

253
00:13:56,187 --> 00:13:59,227
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being thoughtless. It's because we're her friends.</font>

254
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:02,227
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for overreacting.</font>

255
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,587
<font color="yellow">I understand. Just make sure you keep it a secret from Bok Joo.</font>

256
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,727
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing,</font>

257
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,857
<font color="yellow">but this is what her father wants.</font>

258
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:14,487
<font color="yellow">It's right to respect his wish.</font>

259
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,857
<font color="yellow">Okay, I got it.</font>

260
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,527
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We won't tell.</font>

261
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,257
<font color="yellow">I won't see Bok Joo anyway.</font>

262
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,787
<font color="yellow">Our friendship is over after this year.</font>

263
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:33,587
<font color="yellow">I love you, Joon Hyung.</font>

264
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:52,327
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is it so difficult to get a hold of you?</font>

265
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:55,657
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. We kept missing each other.</font>

266
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,857
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - I'm at the gym.</font>

267
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,627
<font color="yellow">Are you in the dormitory?</font>

268
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,027
<font color="yellow">Are you training a lot these days?</font>

269
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:06,057
<font color="yellow">You seem busier than me even though I'm in Taereung.</font>

270
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,587
<font color="yellow">I'm busy with training.</font>

271
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,957
<font color="yellow">Lately, I've been busy with many things.</font>

272
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:13,757
<font color="yellow">Many things? Like what?</font>

273
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,687
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

274
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:19,127
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

275
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,057
<font color="yellow">Why would I be busy?</font>

276
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,227
<font color="yellow">You're so wishy-washy.</font>

277
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,627
<font color="yellow">Is it because you don't like me?</font>

278
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,527
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, come here for a minute.</font>

279
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,887
<font color="yellow">Okay, someone is calling me. I'll call you later.</font>

280
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:37,857
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

281
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,357
<font color="yellow">(Chubs)</font>

282
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,487
<font color="yellow">We only talked for a minute.</font>

283
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,587
<font color="yellow">I miss you more after hearing your voice.</font>

284
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:56,987
<font color="yellow">I miss you, Bok Joo.</font>

285
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,027
<font color="yellow">I miss you like crazy, Bok Joo.</font>

286
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:27,087
<font color="yellow">Let's focus.</font>

287
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,227
<font color="yellow">The competition is coming up. Let's focus.</font>

288
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,287
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Bok Joo? Is your back okay?</font>

289
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,427
<font color="yellow">I think I hurt my back.</font>

290
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,757
<font color="yellow">Your back keeps getting in the way.</font>

291
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,087
<font color="yellow">Your competition is coming up soon.</font>

292
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:53,787
<font color="yellow">Let me see it.</font>

293
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,957
<font color="yellow">- Does it hurt? - It's okay, I can endure the pain.</font>

294
00:16:57,957 --> 00:16:59,657
<font color="yellow">No, it's not good.</font>

295
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,287
<font color="yellow">You can't continue like this.</font>

296
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,557
<font color="yellow">It's better that you get treated first.</font>

297
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,227
<font color="yellow">There's a placed called Dr. Park's Hospital.</font>

298
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,287
<font color="yellow">They specialize in injuries for athletes, so go there for treatment.</font>

299
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,887
<font color="yellow">Get some rest at home, and come back tomorrow.</font>

300
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,587
<font color="yellow">I give you my permission.</font>

301
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,287
<font color="yellow">- Are you being serious? - Yes.</font>

302
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,927
<font color="yellow">You need to change and get in better shape.</font>

303
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,157
<font color="yellow">You can't compete with your back like this.</font>

304
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,227
<font color="yellow">Thank you, I'll go get treated.</font>

305
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,957
<font color="yellow">It must go straight up.</font>

306
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,387
<font color="yellow">There it is.</font>

307
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,957
<font color="yellow">It was a success.</font>

308
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:32,687
<font color="yellow">Is it Tae Kwon?</font>

309
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,557
<font color="yellow">What's up, Tae Kwon?</font>

310
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,427
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm watching competition videos.</font>

311
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,127
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

312
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:42,287
<font color="yellow">I'm not working today.</font>

313
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:46,187
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see a movie with me?</font>

314
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,497
<font color="yellow">A movie sounds good.</font>

315
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:49,887
<font color="yellow">Just a moment. I'll ask Nan Hee when she's back from...</font>

316
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,257
<font color="yellow">Well, don't ask her.</font>

317
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,357
<font color="yellow">Let's go without her.</font>

318
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,687
<font color="yellow">I want to go with you.</font>

319
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:08,527
<font color="yellow">Are you surprised that I asked you out for a movie?</font>

320
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:11,557
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

321
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,527
<font color="yellow">I think I'm more surprised that you're talking to me casually now.</font>

322
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,687
<font color="yellow">Then shall I go back to talking politely?</font>

323
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,727
<font color="yellow">You don't need to do that.</font>

324
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,457
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I'll get used to it soon.</font>

325
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:31,287
<font color="yellow">- Hey, guys! - Gosh.</font>

326
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:34,497
<font color="yellow">Where were you, Nan Hee? My gosh.</font>

327
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:37,287
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Nan Hee. - Where are you guys going?</font>

328
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,787
<font color="yellow">- Well, we were... - We were waiting for you here...</font>

329
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,327
<font color="yellow">to go to the movies with you.</font>

330
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,187
<font color="yellow">- Yes, that's right. - Really?</font>

331
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:47,227
<font color="yellow">My gosh, I love movies.</font>

332
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,457
<font color="yellow">Is this the first official outing of the three of us? I'm so excited.</font>

333
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,187
<font color="yellow">Which movie? There's something I've wanted to watch.</font>

334
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,087
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee loves movies.</font>

335
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,957
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You're welcome.</font>

336
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:10,657
<font color="yellow">This doctor is really good. The tension is gone.</font>

337
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,327
<font color="yellow">Nice. I'm free from the pain now.</font>

338
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,387
<font color="yellow">Would Joon Hyung be done now?</font>

339
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,957
<font color="yellow">I should go home first.</font>

340
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,687
<font color="yellow">Then I should call Dad.</font>

341
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:32,757
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo.</font>

342
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,357
<font color="yellow">Hi, Uncle. Where's Dad?</font>

343
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,527
<font color="yellow">Oh, well... He's in the bathroom.</font>

344
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,387
<font color="yellow">I think he has diarrhea or something.</font>

345
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:44,157
<font color="yellow">Really? What did he eat?</font>

346
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:47,327
<font color="yellow">Uncle, I got a day off to get treatment for my lower back.</font>

347
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,127
<font color="yellow">If I take a taxi, I can be home in 20 minutes.</font>

348
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:53,327
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? You're coming home now?</font>

349
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:59,827
<font color="yellow">Okay. All right, Bok Joo. I left something on the stove.</font>

350
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:01,687
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay. I have to go. Bye.</font>

351
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,557
<font color="yellow">What should we do? She's on her way home now.</font>

352
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,427
<font color="yellow">- What if she sees the sign? - We have no choice.</font>

353
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:12,227
<font color="yellow">- We should go home now. - You'll hurt yourself.</font>

354
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:13,687
<font color="yellow">We're already doomed.</font>

355
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,327
<font color="yellow">She'll be there in 20 minutes. It'll take at least an hour for us.</font>

356
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,687
<font color="yellow">What should we do, then? If she finds out,</font>

357
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,497
<font color="yellow">she'll cry her eyes out and go crazy.</font>

358
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,357
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Let's calm down and try to collect our thoughts.</font>

359
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,927
<font color="yellow">We have to stop her from going home, right?</font>

360
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,757
<font color="yellow">- What about her friends? - Right, her friends.</font>

361
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,587
<font color="yellow">- Shall I ask them to snatch her? - Yes, call them now.</font>

362
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:37,227
<font color="yellow">- You should use your phone. - Oh, right. My phone is here.</font>

363
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,527
<font color="yellow">The seizure procedure has begun. I used to be...</font>

364
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,027
<font color="yellow">a prosecutor in the special crimes unit.</font>

365
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,387
<font color="yellow">The unit is still filled with my junior colleagues.</font>

366
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:48,727
<font color="yellow">Please trust me...</font>

367
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:52,157
<font color="yellow">and sign this power of attorney.</font>

368
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,427
<font color="yellow">I promise you that you will...</font>

369
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,587
<font color="yellow">get your money back.</font>

370
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:05,327
<font color="yellow">It's so funny.</font>

371
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:10,957
<font color="yellow">- I heard they're on bad terms. - Then...</font>

372
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,187
<font color="yellow">That's way too light.</font>

373
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:36,387
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Kim.</font>

374
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,687
<font color="yellow">I'm at the gym now. What's up?</font>

375
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,257
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

376
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:42,957
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo?</font>

377
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,087
<font color="yellow">Gosh. My home sweet home, Bok Chicken!</font>

378
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:49,787
<font color="yellow">Kim Bok Joo is back. I'm home.</font>

379
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:52,757
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo! Bok Joo, Bok Joo!</font>

380
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,727
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung!</font>

381
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,057
<font color="yellow">- How did you know that I'm here? - What?</font>

382
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:05,127
<font color="yellow">I didn't know. I was coming here to eat fried chicken...</font>

383
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,257
<font color="yellow">and saw you.</font>

384
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,027
<font color="yellow">This must be what people call telepathy.</font>

385
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,627
<font color="yellow">We must be really meant to be.</font>

386
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,587
<font color="yellow">It is pretty cool. Let's go in together.</font>

387
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:17,957
<font color="yellow">Hey! Bok Joo.</font>

388
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,827
<font color="yellow">I missed you so much.</font>

389
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:20,887
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

390
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,287
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you do something wrong?</font>

391
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:26,687
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're overreacting like this?</font>

392
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,887
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I just missed you too much.</font>

393
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:34,487
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go. We should go eat something delicious.</font>

394
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,627
<font color="yellow">How about we go for barbecue?</font>

395
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:39,327
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll go in and say hi to my dad before we go.</font>

396
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:41,787
<font color="yellow">Hey! You can do that later.</font>

397
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:44,757
<font color="yellow">I'm starving right now. Let's go eat meat. It's on me.</font>

398
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:45,957
<font color="yellow">Turn around!</font>

399
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:48,027
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

400
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:50,457
<font color="yellow">Hurry up now.</font>

401
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:02,857
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why I have to eat fried chicken here,</font>

402
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:06,327
<font color="yellow">but I guess knowing my enemy isn't a bad thing. Let's eat.</font>

403
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:08,157
<font color="yellow">Yes, exactly. Eat up.</font>

404
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:11,427
<font color="yellow">It looks like you've lost a bit of weight.</font>

405
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,557
<font color="yellow">- I've gained weight. - I haven't seen you in so long.</font>

406
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,227
<font color="yellow">How have you been, Chubs?</font>

407
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:18,827
<font color="yellow">You're asking that just now?</font>

408
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:22,227
<font color="yellow">- I've been great. Are we good now? - Do you have to talk like that?</font>

409
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:24,327
<font color="yellow">You haven't seen your darling here in such a long time.</font>

410
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:25,557
<font color="yellow">My darling? Whatever.</font>

411
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:29,887
<font color="yellow">Hey, be honest with me.</font>

412
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,187
<font color="yellow">What are you up to these days?</font>

413
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:34,457
<font color="yellow">Have you been partying like crazy and hanging out with girls?</font>

414
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:37,327
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm crazy? I know that I'll die in your hands if I do that.</font>

415
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:39,587
<font color="yellow">- So you didn't do that? - Of course not.</font>

416
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,527
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the washroom.</font>

417
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:13,287
<font color="yellow">Hello? Go ahead.</font>

418
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,257
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's going on? Are you with Bok Joo?</font>

419
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,957
<font color="yellow">I'm making sure she can't go anywhere. Don't worry.</font>

420
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,357
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Thanks so much, Joon Hyung.</font>

421
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:24,457
<font color="yellow">I think we'll be home in about 20 minutes.</font>

422
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,727
<font color="yellow">Stall her for another 30 minutes, okay?</font>

423
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,027
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will. Please don't worry.</font>

424
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,127
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to keep Bok Joo here. Yes.</font>

425
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:33,287
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

426
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:40,227
<font color="yellow">Yes. I should go. All right.</font>

427
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,527
<font color="yellow">Weren't you going to the washroom? Why are you taking a call here?</font>

428
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,387
<font color="yellow">Well... I was feeling a little claustrophobic,</font>

429
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,057
<font color="yellow">so I wanted to get some fresh air.</font>

430
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,827
<font color="yellow">- Who called you? - What? It's someone you don't know.</font>

431
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:58,127
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go eat. The chicken will get cold.</font>

432
00:24:58,127 --> 00:24:59,157
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's go.</font>

433
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:01,887
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

434
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:05,687
<font color="yellow">Who was it? Why can't you tell me?</font>

435
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:09,187
<font color="yellow">It's not that I can't tell you. It's just someone you don't know.</font>

436
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:12,257
<font color="yellow">So who is it? I'm sure that person has a name. Tell me.</font>

437
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,987
<font color="yellow">Well... You don't know him.</font>

438
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,857
<font color="yellow">Seung... His name is Seung Jin. He's my friend from high school.</font>

439
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,887
<font color="yellow">Friend? Do you usually talk that politely to your friends?</font>

440
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,657
<font color="yellow">You must have huge respect for him.</font>

441
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:27,327
<font color="yellow">Hey, when did I talk like that?</font>

442
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,387
<font color="yellow">You misheard me.</font>

443
00:25:29,857 --> 00:25:32,927
<font color="yellow">We haven't seen each other forever. Why are you trying to pick a fight?</font>

444
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:35,557
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a friend, right? I'm sure it was a girl.</font>

445
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:39,757
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Why are you so suspicious of me?</font>

446
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,627
<font color="yellow">It's because you're acting suspiciously!</font>

447
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:43,687
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone. Show me his name.</font>

448
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:45,257
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

449
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:47,987
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious. How dare you glare at me.</font>

450
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:50,957
<font color="yellow">What you're doing is only increasing my suspicion. Give it to me.</font>

451
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:53,557
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. I don't want to. - You said you did nothing wrong.</font>

452
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:54,687
<font color="yellow">Show me his name. Give it to me.</font>

453
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,757
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with you? Do you not trust me?</font>

454
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:01,927
<font color="yellow">Okay. I was out of line.</font>

455
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,457
<font color="yellow">I've been on edge because of my training. Let's not fight.</font>

456
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:12,357
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why are you suspicious of me?</font>

457
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:15,787
<font color="yellow">I haven't even looked at other girls. Never.</font>

458
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:16,827
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

459
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:23,757
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey! Give it back.</font>

460
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:26,227
<font color="yellow">- Who is this person? - Hey, give it back to me now.</font>

461
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:30,157
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop.</font>

462
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:31,987
<font color="yellow">Give it back!</font>

463
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:33,987
<font color="yellow">Give it back to me, seriously.</font>

464
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,327
<font color="yellow">I know that we're dating, but we must respect each other's privacy.</font>

465
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,827
<font color="yellow">Going through your boyfriend's phone...</font>

466
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,327
<font color="yellow">is such a mannerless thing to do.</font>

467
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:46,227
<font color="yellow">Privacy? Mannerless?</font>

468
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:48,587
<font color="yellow">My gosh! You're so intelligent.</font>

469
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:51,627
<font color="yellow">I don't know what privacy or manners are, so I'll just leave you alone.</font>

470
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,857
<font color="yellow">Have fun with your new girlfriend. Bye!</font>

471
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:56,387
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait. Hey!</font>

472
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:00,157
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

473
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:02,187
<font color="yellow">Oh, I have to pay.</font>

474
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:03,827
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo. Wait up!</font>

475
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,727
<font color="yellow">What is the matter with you? It's nothing to get angry about.</font>

476
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:09,327
<font color="yellow">Right. I'm getting worked up over nothing, aren't I?</font>

477
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,357
<font color="yellow">I'm overreacting, and I have trust issues. Let's say it's all my fault!</font>

478
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,957
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you talking like that?</font>

479
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,457
<font color="yellow">We haven't seen each other forever. Let's make up.</font>

480
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,057
<font color="yellow">Right. I didn't want to be like this as I haven't seen you in so long,</font>

481
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,687
<font color="yellow">but I can't stop feeling angry.</font>

482
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,087
<font color="yellow">My lower back is killing me, but I was still so excited...</font>

483
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,057
<font color="yellow">to see you and Dad. I was such an idiot!</font>

484
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,687
<font color="yellow">I really didn't think you'd do this to me.</font>

485
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,627
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Bok Joo.</font>

486
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:34,857
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't even tell her the truth.</font>

487
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:39,787
<font color="yellow">Has it been 30 minutes? Goodness.</font>

488
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,957
<font color="yellow">He doesn't love me as much anymore. What a jerk.</font>

489
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,687
<font color="yellow">He used to be so sweet to me.</font>

490
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:46,787
<font color="yellow">We weren't even apart for that long.</font>

491
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:51,127
<font color="yellow">Fine. The world is wide, and there're many pretty girls.</font>

492
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:53,257
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

493
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:56,857
<font color="yellow">(Bok Chicken)</font>

494
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,127
<font color="yellow">Dad. Uncle.</font>

495
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,957
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing, Uncle? - What?</font>

496
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,857
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo. You're here.</font>

497
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:15,187
<font color="yellow">Is your back okay now? Did you get it treated?</font>

498
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:17,587
<font color="yellow">I went to the hospital the coach told me about. I feel much better.</font>

499
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:20,127
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing a mask? Did you catch a cold?</font>

500
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:24,087
<font color="yellow">I might give it to the customers. It's just a prevention.</font>

501
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,257
<font color="yellow">Be careful, Dad. They say the flu this winter is really bad.</font>

502
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,127
<font color="yellow">Why are you sweating so much, Uncle?</font>

503
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,187
<font color="yellow">Did you go somewhere?</font>

504
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,727
<font color="yellow">Well... I think I've become poor in health.</font>

505
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,657
<font color="yellow">I sweat so much these days.</font>

506
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,757
<font color="yellow">I guess my male menopause started early.</font>

507
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:42,057
<font color="yellow">You should get married soon.</font>

508
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,757
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

509
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,857
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - It's a prevention.</font>

510
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,727
<font color="yellow">Why are you cleaning the fire extinguisher?</font>

511
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:50,457
<font color="yellow">To prevent fire.</font>

512
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:52,157
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo! - Bok Joo!</font>

513
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:55,027
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, guys? Did you know I was here?</font>

514
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:58,657
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - We just came to eat chicken,</font>

515
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,257
<font color="yellow">and we heard your voice.</font>

516
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:03,787
<font color="yellow">We just have telepathic connections, don't we?</font>

517
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:05,687
<font color="yellow">- We're awesome. - Awesome.</font>

518
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,087
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

519
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:10,027
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone keep talking about telepathy?</font>

520
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:12,227
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, I missed you.</font>

521
00:29:13,157 --> 00:29:14,557
<font color="yellow">- Did you? - Welcome back.</font>

522
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,087
<font color="yellow">You eat chicken without me now.</font>

523
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:28,457
<font color="yellow">Dr. Go. He's late today.</font>

524
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:29,927
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's busy.</font>

525
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,627
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm not waiting for him.</font>

526
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,487
<font color="yellow">I didn't say you were.</font>

527
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:36,487
<font color="yellow">Should we go home first?</font>

528
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:39,157
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm going to go home soon, too.</font>

529
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:41,487
<font color="yellow">- I just want to see some documents. - Okay.</font>

530
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:54,857
<font color="yellow">Ah Young.</font>

531
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:01,957
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

532
00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:03,857
<font color="yellow">A seminar suddenly came up.</font>

533
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:05,957
<font color="yellow">I came as soon as it ended,</font>

534
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:07,757
<font color="yellow">but I'm a little late.</font>

535
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,827
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to keep you waiting, so I drove really fast.</font>

536
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:13,127
<font color="yellow">I wasn't waiting for you.</font>

537
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:16,927
<font color="yellow">- I just had many patients today. - Is that so?</font>

538
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:19,487
<font color="yellow">I guess I was happy over nothing.</font>

539
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:22,357
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

540
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:24,587
<font color="yellow">Of course. I had dinner with the nurses.</font>

541
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,687
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

542
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,057
<font color="yellow">You're still going to eat with me, right?</font>

543
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,187
<font color="yellow">I rushed all the way here.</font>

544
00:30:31,187 --> 00:30:32,227
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

545
00:30:32,857 --> 00:30:36,057
<font color="yellow">You did come all the way here. I can't really tell you to go back.</font>

546
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:38,327
<font color="yellow">Let's go, then.</font>

547
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,927
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat up.</font>

548
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:01,257
<font color="yellow">They make delicious food here.</font>

549
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:04,627
<font color="yellow">I couldn't finish my dinner because I got a patient.</font>

550
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:06,957
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

551
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,987
<font color="yellow">Eat up. I didn't say anything.</font>

552
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:15,057
<font color="yellow">By the way, I think we've been to almost every restaurant here.</font>

553
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:16,857
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

554
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:18,927
<font color="yellow">I guess you're right.</font>

555
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,787
<font color="yellow">I wanted to buy you something more delicious,</font>

556
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:23,457
<font color="yellow">but I don't know this neighborhood well.</font>

557
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:26,487
<font color="yellow">So I looked up the good restaurants near here on the internet.</font>

558
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,127
<font color="yellow">There is...</font>

559
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,957
<font color="yellow">a very famous place that makes squid and pork bulgogi.</font>

560
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:34,387
<font color="yellow">Also, there is a popular samgyetang restaurant in the suburb.</font>

561
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:35,887
<font color="yellow">The drumsticks look good.</font>

562
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:40,087
<font color="yellow">And we can go to eat rice with wraps, too. You like that, right?</font>

563
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,887
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Look at these pictures.</font>

564
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,157
<font color="yellow">Look. What do you think?</font>

565
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:46,487
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to eat it next time?</font>

566
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:51,687
<font color="yellow">I should go.</font>

567
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,187
<font color="yellow">I have some more work to do. You should stay and eat.</font>

568
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,027
<font color="yellow">Ah Young.</font>

569
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,287
<font color="yellow">Ah Young. Hang on.</font>

570
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,457
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

571
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,587
<font color="yellow">- Please keep the change. - Thank you.</font>

572
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:08,587
<font color="yellow">Ah Young!</font>

573
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,787
<font color="yellow">Ah Young. What's wrong?</font>

574
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:13,327
<font color="yellow">Did I make a mistake again?</font>

575
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,427
<font color="yellow">Yes. You did.</font>

576
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,857
<font color="yellow">I moved here to avoid you. I wanted to be away from you.</font>

577
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:21,757
<font color="yellow">These days,</font>

578
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,627
<font color="yellow">I find myself waiting for you every evening.</font>

579
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,227
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm developing a crush on you all over again.</font>

580
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:31,127
<font color="yellow">It scares me so much. I hate it.</font>

581
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:33,757
<font color="yellow">So don't come out here again.</font>

582
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:36,287
<font color="yellow">I won't eat with you anymore.</font>

583
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:45,487
<font color="yellow">I hate Seoul without you in it.</font>

584
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,387
<font color="yellow">It's too lonely.</font>

585
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,757
<font color="yellow">So don't tell me not to come.</font>

586
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,087
<font color="yellow">What did you...</font>

587
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:03,787
<font color="yellow">mean by the things you just said?</font>

588
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,287
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

589
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:10,227
<font color="yellow">like Messi?</font>

590
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:19,087
<font color="yellow">That's a bad way to propose to someone.</font>

591
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,527
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

592
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,927
<font color="yellow">No, not that.</font>

593
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,127
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Here.</font>

594
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:57,757
<font color="yellow">Get it yourself.</font>

595
00:33:57,757 --> 00:34:00,287
<font color="yellow">- You're so lazy. - Just eat this.</font>

596
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,187
<font color="yellow">- I can't reach it. - Gosh.</font>

597
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,257
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Why aren't you answering?</font>

598
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,587
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Isn't that Joon Hyung?</font>

599
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,427
<font color="yellow">- Why aren't you answering? - Whatever. I hate him.</font>

640

905
00:54:46,057 --> 00:54:49,327
<font color="yellow">Thank you for those vitamins you sent for me. They're great.</font>

906
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:53,127
<font color="yellow">It's nothing compared to all the fried chicken you've sent.</font>

907
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:54,787
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious.</font>

908
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:56,827
<font color="yellow">You're a master of fried chicken.</font>

909
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:01,527
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I deep-fry 70 percent of our fried chicken.</font>

910
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:04,387
<font color="yellow">Please visit our restaurant. I'll close it for the day...</font>

911
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,157
<font color="yellow">and make as much fried chicken as you want.</font>

912
00:55:08,057 --> 00:55:10,587
<font color="yellow">Then we'll give you the red ginseng drink in return.</font>

913
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:12,257
<font color="yellow">Please visit our pharmacy.</font>

914
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:15,257
<font color="yellow">It looks as if you two are getting engaged.</font>

915
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:16,987
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

916
00:55:17,257 --> 00:55:18,357
<font color="yellow">You got me a gift, right?</font>

917
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:20,987
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Bok Joo.</font>

918
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,057
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on setting a date for your wedding.</font>

919
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,457
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations, Dr. Go. - Thanks.</font>

920
00:55:25,857 --> 00:55:28,057
<font color="yellow">You'll need to help me out if we become sisters-in-law.</font>

921
00:55:28,357 --> 00:55:29,727
<font color="yellow">You know how clumsy I am, right?</font>

922
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:31,287
<font color="yellow">Gosh, stop it.</font>

923
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:34,687
<font color="yellow">Here, Bok Joo.</font>

924
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:35,857
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Joon Hyung, here.</font>

925
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:38,587
<font color="yellow">Dad, smell these flowers.</font>

926
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:40,627
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo. - Bok Joo, let's take photos.</font>

927
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:41,957
<font color="yellow">Hello, everyone.</font>

928
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:45,327
<font color="yellow">I, Sergeant Cho Tae Kwon, will be your photographer today.</font>

929
00:55:45,457 --> 00:55:46,487
<font color="yellow">Hello, hello.</font>

930
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:49,057
<font color="yellow">Shall we start with Joon Hyung's family?</font>

931
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,357
<font color="yellow">All right. Please stand right there. I'll take a few photos.</font>

932
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,327
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

933
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:10,357
<font color="yellow">I guess I won't be able to come here after today.</font>

934
00:56:11,357 --> 00:56:14,757
<font color="yellow">I can probably buy 100 chickens with all the change I spent here.</font>

935
00:56:15,427 --> 00:56:17,727
<font color="yellow">Thanks to it, you achieved all of your dreams.</font>

936
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:20,487
<font color="yellow">I mean, you joined the national team and even got a boyfriend.</font>

937
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,587
<font color="yellow">A handsome boyfriend.</font>

938
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:24,687
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

939
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,557
<font color="yellow">You don't think I'm handsome?</font>

940
00:56:27,657 --> 00:56:29,827
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll give it to you as your graduation gift. You're handsome.</font>

941
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:38,587
<font color="yellow">So many things happened on this campus in the last four years.</font>

942
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:41,987
<font color="yellow">I trained hard...</font>

943
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,487
<font color="yellow">and ate a lot with Nan Hee and Seon Ok.</font>

944
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:47,957
<font color="yellow">We spent so much time together, too.</font>

945
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:57,927
<font color="yellow">I think I'll miss this place a lot, too.</font>

946
00:56:58,527 --> 00:57:00,627
<font color="yellow">I ran so hard here...</font>

947
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:02,727
<font color="yellow">and even had to drag tires.</font>

948
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:06,057
<font color="yellow">When do you have to go back to Taereung tomorrow?</font>

949
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:08,427
<font color="yellow">- Will you get to go on the match? - I think so.</font>

950
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:11,887
<font color="yellow">One of the senior members has a shoulder injury, so I'll probably...</font>

951
00:57:12,587 --> 00:57:15,057
<font color="yellow">Look at you. That's awesome!</font>

952
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,727
<font color="yellow">Do you want to bet on who will win more medals at the Tokyo Olympics?</font>

953
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:18,787
<font color="yellow">How about 100 dollars? Are you in?</font>

954
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:20,457
<font color="yellow">Hey, 100 dollars is too little.</font>

955
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:22,057
<font color="yellow">It has to be at least 1,000 dollars.</font>

956
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:26,127
<font color="yellow">Also, I'll be more famous than you after the Olympics.</font>

957
00:57:26,127 --> 00:57:27,487
<font color="yellow">Do you want my autograph?</font>

958
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:30,657
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Just make sure I'll be able to see you in Japan.</font>

959
00:57:33,027 --> 00:57:34,087
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

960
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,387
<font color="yellow">If I win a gold medal this time,</font>

961
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:41,857
<font color="yellow">would you marry me?</font>

962
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:44,887
<font color="yellow">I'll get pension, you know.</font>

963
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:46,757
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of you.</font>

964
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:48,957
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

965
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:52,987
<font color="yellow">But shouldn't you train hard if you want to win a gold medal?</font>

966
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:54,787
<font color="yellow">With that said, let's run together.</font>

967
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:59,057
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to run on our graduation day? No.</font>

968
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:00,787
<font color="yellow">You're a big slacker.</font>

969
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:03,227
<font color="yellow">If you slack off even just a day, your body will get stiff.</font>

970
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:05,227
<font color="yellow">- Let's run. - No.</font>

971
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:07,257
<font color="yellow">- Let's run. - I said no.</font>

972
00:58:09,187 --> 00:58:10,227
<font color="yellow">I won't marry you.</font>

973
00:58:11,457 --> 00:58:13,657
<font color="yellow">Hey. What do you mean you won't marry me?</font>

974
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,027
<font color="yellow">If you say that, now I have no choice but to run.</font>

975
00:58:17,687 --> 00:58:18,757
<font color="yellow">I won't marry you.</font>

976
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:20,587
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

977
00:58:21,687 --> 00:58:22,757
<font color="yellow">Hug me.</font>

978
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:24,887
<font color="yellow">Everyone spends their youthful years.</font>

979
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:28,187
<font color="yellow">It's a time more beautiful...</font>

980
00:58:29,187 --> 00:58:31,687
<font color="yellow">because we're immature, and a time that sparkles brightly.</font>

981
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:35,757
<font color="yellow">We're not afraid because we have nothing to lose,</font>

982
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,327
<font color="yellow">and our hearts flutter because we can have anything.</font>

983
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:42,727
<font color="yellow">A 24-year-old youth.</font>

984
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,857
<font color="yellow">I'm not complete yet,</font>

985
00:58:46,687 --> 00:58:48,857
<font color="yellow">but I'm more than perfect already.</font>

986
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:21,587
<font color="yellow">(We thank the immature but eager 21-year-old youths and the viewers.)</font>

987
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:29,157
<font color="yellow">(Dear youths who are living the present, you're awesome!)</font>
