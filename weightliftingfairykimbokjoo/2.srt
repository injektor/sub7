00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,850
<font color="yellow">Other than getting taller, she hasn't changed much.</font>

158
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,620
<font color="yellow">You must be having a lot of fun.</font>

159
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,920
<font color="yellow">You're such a great guy.</font>

160
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,880
<font color="yellow">It's so much fun!</font>

161
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,550
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Joon Hyung is driving me crazy.</font>

162
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,320
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is?</font>

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,790
<font color="yellow">He teases you more because you get so upset.</font>

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,750
<font color="yellow">I can see that he's having a lot of fun.</font>

165
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,880
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're completely innocent.</font>

166
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,790
<font color="yellow">You made him look like a pervert.</font>

167
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,650
<font color="yellow">Hey, it was just a misunderstanding.</font>

168
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,720
<font color="yellow">Besides, I apologized to him.</font>

169
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,980
<font color="yellow">Either way,</font>

170
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,680
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous of you.</font>

171
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,620
<font color="yellow">I don't care if he teases me.</font>

172
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,850
<font color="yellow">I'd love to have such a handsome friend like him.</font>

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
<font color="yellow">Isn't it pleasing just to look at him?</font>

174
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
<font color="yellow">He's such an eye candy.</font>

175
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,750
<font color="yellow">Aren't you proud that you know him?</font>

176
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,450
<font color="yellow">He's not an eye candy. He makes my blood boil.</font>

177
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
<font color="yellow">You say that, but doesn't your heart flutter a little?</font>

178
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

179
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,620
<font color="yellow">Such a handsome friend approaches you out of the blue,</font>

180
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,750
<font color="yellow">and your heart doesn't flutter at all?</font>

181
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,720
<font color="yellow">I bet she's itching to go on a date with him.</font>

182
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,220
<font color="yellow">He's not handsome at all.</font>

183
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,880
<font color="yellow">I don't fall in love with every handsome man.</font>

184
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,950
<font color="yellow">Unlike you two, I'm not interested in men at all.</font>

185
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,550
<font color="yellow">I can't think about dating.</font>

186
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,120
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy with weightlifting.</font>

187
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,650
<font color="yellow">Of course you fall in love with handsome men.</font>

188
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,680
<font color="yellow">Could you give us more pickles?</font>

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,980
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

190
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,420
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

191
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
<font color="yellow">Please give us more water.</font>

192
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,880
<font color="yellow">This is Bok Chicken.</font>

193
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,250
<font color="yellow">Four glasses of beer are coming up.</font>

194
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,420
<font color="yellow">We have many deliveries. You'll have to wait 30 minutes.</font>

195
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,650
<font color="yellow">Okay, we'll hurry. Thank you.</font>

196
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,650
<font color="yellow">Dad, an order of half fried, half spicy.</font>

197
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,650
<font color="yellow">The business is going really well here.</font>

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,550
<font color="yellow">I think this place will get bigger.</font>

199
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,980
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

200
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,950
<font color="yellow">- It's delicious. - Help yourself.</font>

201
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,650
<font color="yellow">Did you hear the order?</font>

202
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,250
<font color="yellow">I'm not deaf. You should go back to school.</font>

203
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,950
<font color="yellow">I fired the part-time worker.</font>

204
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,750
<font color="yellow">We didn't even discuss it.</font>

206
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,980
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

207
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

208
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,950
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to read my palm.</font>

209
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
<font color="yellow">I'll work if you pay me.</font>

210
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,150
<font color="yellow">If not, I'll report you to the Ministry of Labor for not paying me.</font>

211
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,350
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

212
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,720
<font color="yellow">Then you should pay me for raising you all these years.</font>

213
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,780
<font color="yellow">You eat twice as much as other people.</font>

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,380
<font color="yellow">I work so hard to support you, and you don't work on weightlifting.</font>

215
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,750
<font color="yellow">You're worse than her, you punk.</font>

216
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you call her here?</font>

217
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,720
<font color="yellow">How could we refuse to serve a big group of customers?</font>

218
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,980
<font color="yellow">If you cook, and I serve, who would do the deliveries?</font>

219
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,350
<font color="yellow">Don't talk back at me.</font>

220
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,220
<font color="yellow">Could we get some more popcorn?</font>

221
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

222
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,950
<font color="yellow">- Isn't the popcorn delicious? - I'm thirsty.</font>

223
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,250
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

224
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,020
<font color="yellow">Your popcorn is coming up soon.</font>

225
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,820
<font color="yellow">Shall we order some chicken?</font>

226
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,880
<font color="yellow">- This place makes good popcorn. - Okay, fine.</font>

227
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,220
<font color="yellow">Please bring us a lot of popcorn.</font>

228
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,150
<font color="yellow">Those cheap punks, how much popcorn do they need...</font>

229
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,950
<font color="yellow">- for just two glasses of beer? - Watch your mouth.</font>

230
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,320
<font color="yellow">He makes everyone at Haneol Sport University proud.</font>

231
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,980
<font color="yellow">He's on the national shooting team.</font>

232
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,480
<font color="yellow">It's Jong Suk.</font>

233
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,020
<font color="yellow">People like him help us with our business.</font>

234
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,750
<font color="yellow">You don't know how to run a business.</font>

235
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
<font color="yellow">He totally belongs to me.</font>

236
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,620
<font color="yellow">Get the popcorn.</font>

237
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,250
<font color="yellow">Get it before I beat you.</font>

238
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,220
<font color="yellow">- Joon Hyung. They're yours. - We did your laundry.</font>

239
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh, thank you. It must be hard to be the minions.</font>

240
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,550
<font color="yellow">Didn't you do mine?</font>

241
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,050
<font color="yellow">No. You hardly put out your laundry.</font>

242
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,250
<font color="yellow">Put it out already. Stop wearing the same clothes over and over.</font>

243
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,920
<font color="yellow">Hey. Let me clear this up.</font>

244
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,950
<font color="yellow">I swear I'm not...</font>

245
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,780
<font color="yellow">dirty or lazy.</font>

246
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,850
<font color="yellow">I just don't want to trouble them.</font>

247
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,920
<font color="yellow">By the way, I'm hungry. Our dear juniors are working so hard.</font>

248
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,650
<font color="yellow">Why don't you treat them some food?</font>

249
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,680
<font color="yellow">You're the one who is hungry. I don't know why I should...</font>

250
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,550
<font color="yellow">buy them food.</font>

251
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
<font color="yellow">- Do you want me to? - Thank you.</font>

252
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,920
<font color="yellow">- Do you want it? - Yes.</font>

253
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,950
<font color="yellow">- All right! - Yes!</font>

254
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,980
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

255
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,050
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Joon Hyung is the best!</font>

256
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,320
<font color="yellow">What's this? A dressing table?</font>

257
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,780
<font color="yellow">Dad must've picked it up on a street again.</font>

258
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving it to them?</font>

259
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,680
<font color="yellow">I don't know if you'd like this popcorn or not.</font>

260
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,920
<font color="yellow">Please help yourselves.</font>

261
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,120
<font color="yellow">Wait. Excuse me.</font>

262
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,050
<font color="yellow">Have we met before?</font>

263
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,820
<font color="yellow">Weren't you on the weekend drama?</font>

264
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,820
<font color="yellow">You're the patient next to the lead character in the hospital.</font>

265
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,950
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

266
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,920
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think that's me.</font>

267
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,950
<font color="yellow">That was me.</font>

268
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,550
<font color="yellow">That was only a few scenes. You have a good eye.</font>

269
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,380
<font color="yellow">I've never seen a celebrity before. This is amazing.</font>

270
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,950
<font color="yellow">- He's handsome. - You're so handsome.</font>

271
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,650
<font color="yellow">Celebrities aren't so special. We also drink, pass gas,</font>

272
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,720
<font color="yellow">go to the toilet, and do everything normal people do.</font>

273
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,080
<font color="yellow">Come on. You also look like a main character of a cartoon.</font>

274
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,650
<font color="yellow">You can eat this all. Please eat up.</font>

275
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,220
<font color="yellow">He called you a celebrity.</font>

276
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,520
<font color="yellow">Dad. Where did you get the dressing table? Is it from the street again?</font>

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,950
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,820
<font color="yellow">You've been complaining that we don't have a big mirror.</font>

279
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,150
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you actually bought that? You?</font>

280
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,520
<font color="yellow">Of course I did.</font>

281
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,920
<font color="yellow">I got it at a cheap price on the internet.</font>

282
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You said athletes don't...</font>

283
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,720
<font color="yellow">need a mirror. You're cold outside and warm inside.</font>

284
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
<font color="yellow">What? I'm cold?</font>

285
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,780
<font color="yellow">But warm inside.</font>

286
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,050
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you're considerate, only pretending not to be.</font>

287
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,520
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What are you saying?</font>

288
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho. Here's the chicken. Go and deliver it.</font>

289
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,950
<font color="yellow">I'm a celebrity that people recognize.</font>

290
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,620
<font color="yellow">I can't be seen as a delivery guy now.</font>

291
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,480
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'll deliver it. Where is the place?</font>

292
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,520
<font color="yellow">- Your school. - All right.</font>

293
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,680
<font color="yellow">I should... I should go instead.</font>

294
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,650
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

295
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,350
<font color="yellow">It's been over 30 minutes since we ordered.</font>

296
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,420
<font color="yellow">- Let's order at someplace else. - Why?</font>

297
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,720
<font color="yellow">That place's chicken is delicious.</font>

298
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,650
<font color="yellow">- You little... - It'll be here. Be patient.</font>

299
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,920
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

300
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,620
<font color="yellow">Did somebody order fried chicken from Bok Chicken?</font>

301
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,480
<font color="yellow">Chicken delivery. It's from Bok Chicken.</font>

302
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,020
<font color="yellow">- We did! - It's us!</font>

303
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,650
<font color="yellow">Do you deliver chicken, too?</font>

304
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,120
<font color="yellow">Fried chicken, spicy chicken, and teriyaki chicken.</font>

305
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,520
<font color="yellow">- It'll be 38 dollars. - All right.</font>

306
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,490

609
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,450
<font color="yellow">I'll make it work somehow.</font>

610
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,950
<font color="yellow">You should sleep at home from now on.</font>

611
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,720
<font color="yellow">Please, I beg you.</font>

612
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,080
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself.</font>

613
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

614
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,280
<font color="yellow">Look at that. He has an upset stomach again.</font>

615
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,180
<font color="yellow">I should have bought them already. It's so annoying.</font>

616
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,620
<font color="yellow">What did women do to deserve this?</font>

617
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,980
<font color="yellow">What are you praying for?</font>

618
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
<font color="yellow">A gold medal?</font>

619
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,620
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

620
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,750
<font color="yellow">You're right. Good luck with training, and don't get injured.</font>

621
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,020
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he prying like usual?</font>

622
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,750
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

623
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,390
<font color="yellow">Again.</font>

624
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being late.</font>

625
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,350
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi.</font>

626
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,820
<font color="yellow">- What's that? - I brought some snacks.</font>

627
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,890
<font color="yellow">Huddle, everyone.</font>

628
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,890
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

629
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,420
<font color="yellow">Didn't you already digest your breakfast?</font>

630
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,550
<font color="yellow">Let's take a break for some snacks.</font>

631
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,680
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

632
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,390
<font color="yellow">Here, catch it.</font>

633
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,220
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Let me have one.</font>

634
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,780
<font color="yellow">Here you go, Professor.</font>

635
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

636
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,950
<font color="yellow">Come on, I bet you didn't have proper breakfast, either.</font>

637
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,550
<font color="yellow">I had some rice with soup.</font>

638
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,020
<font color="yellow">When did you get the snacks?</font>

639
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,050
<font color="yellow">- I... - Coach Choi.</font>

640
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,420
<font color="yellow">It doesn't taste the same. Isn't it from the same shop?</font>

641
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,020
<font color="yellow">I got it from a different shop. Doesn't it taste good?</font>

642
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,720
<font color="yellow">- It's not good. - It tastes fine to me.</font>

643
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
<font color="yellow">It's different.</font>

644
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,390
<font color="yellow">- I don't like it at all. - Me, neither.</font>

645
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,950
<font color="yellow">- It tastes strange. - It's bad.</font>

646
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,020
<font color="yellow">The ham doesn't taste the same.</font>

647
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,450
<font color="yellow">- It smells bad. - How different can gimbap get?</font>

648
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,020
<font color="yellow">Just eat it.</font>

649
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,250
<font color="yellow">You don't know how to be grateful.</font>

650
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,620
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

651
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,720
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

652
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,280
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

653
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,320
<font color="yellow">Take your mark.</font>

654
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,850
<font color="yellow">Keep it up. Keep going.</font>

655
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,620
<font color="yellow">Move, move, move! Hurry up.</font>

656
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,950
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go.</font>

657
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,080
<font color="yellow">Keep going.</font>

658
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,620
<font color="yellow">You're almost there.</font>

659
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,390
<font color="yellow">Stop the time.</font>

660
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,680
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

661
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,680
<font color="yellow">- Good job. - Hurry up.</font>

662
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,850
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

663
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,280
<font color="yellow">This might make me lose all of my hair.</font>

664
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,750
<font color="yellow">- Do you want it? - Yes.</font>

665
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

666
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,080
<font color="yellow">I heard you were offered to be Tae Hoon's private training partner.</font>

667
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,080
<font color="yellow">- What? - I heard you rejected it.</font>

668
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,350
<font color="yellow">- Is that true? - What?</font>

669
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,620
<font color="yellow">You're so impressive.</font>

670
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,150
<font color="yellow">You even rejected an offer from a famous swimmer.</font>

671
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,780
<font color="yellow">You should have taken it.</font>

672
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,250
<font color="yellow">You could earn money by being his partner.</font>

673
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,920
<font color="yellow">You could also travel abroad with Tae Hoon.</font>

674
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that be better?</font>

675
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,680
<font color="yellow">Having high self-esteem can be a bad thing.</font>

676
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,390
<font color="yellow">What a sociopath.</font>

677
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he feels inferior to you.</font>

678
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,850
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you okay?</font>

679
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,750
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

680
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

681
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,480
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

682
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's better?</font>

683
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,550
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about suggesting psychotherapy to Joon Hyung,</font>

684
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,650
<font color="yellow">but some athletes reject the idea of getting therapy.</font>

685
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,550
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a knack...</font>

686
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,980
<font color="yellow">for making people take your advice by being very friendly?</font>

687
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,390
<font color="yellow">Give it a try.</font>

688
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,680
<font color="yellow">It sounds like a command.</font>

689
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,980
<font color="yellow">Come on, that doesn't look good.</font>

690
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,950
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

691
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,450
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

692
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,350
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

693
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,550
<font color="yellow">- Were you the one who called me? - Were you surprised?</font>

694
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,080
<font color="yellow">I was surprised to see him here for some coffee, but it turns out...</font>

695
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,050
<font color="yellow">- that he wanted to see you instead. - No way.</font>

696
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,550
<font color="yellow">I stopped by because I was in the neighborhood.</font>

697
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,420
<font color="yellow">We already saw each other this morning.</font>

698
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,820
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with seeing me again?</font>

699
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,820
<font color="yellow">You two are something.</font>

700
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,280
<font color="yellow">Why don't you make a film about brotherly love?</font>

701
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,390
<font color="yellow">No, we're the opposite.</font>

702
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,150
<font color="yellow">He's kind but unattractive,</font>

703
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,220
<font color="yellow">and I'm bad but very charming.</font>

704
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,450
<font color="yellow">- Let me put this over your mouth. - I'm sorry.</font>

705
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,980
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - I'm sorry.</font>

706
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,350
<font color="yellow">I gave it some thought.</font>

707
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,680
<font color="yellow">How about seeing a therapist?</font>

708
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,320
<font color="yellow">I know some well-known therapists.</font>

709
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
<font color="yellow">You could get a recommendation.</font>

710
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,950
<font color="yellow">Is that what you thought about all day?</font>

711
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,280
<font color="yellow">You concern yourself too much.</font>

712
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,250
<font color="yellow">It's better than not seeing anyone.</font>

713
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,720
<font color="yellow">Many athletes see therapists, too.</font>

714
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,980
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

715
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,480
<font color="yellow">I understand, so text me when you get me an appointment.</font>

716
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,650
<font color="yellow">I'll give it a try.</font>

717
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,280
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you decided to do it.</font>

718
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,950
<font color="yellow">Just give it a try.</font>

719
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,750
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

720
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I didn't bring an umbrella.</font>

721
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,780
<font color="yellow">Take this. I'll run.</font>

722
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,050
<font color="yellow">It's not raining much. Let's share it.</font>

723
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,850
<font color="yellow">There's no way.</font>

724
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,480
<font color="yellow">See you again.</font>

725
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,120
<font color="yellow">(Lost Dressing Table)</font>

726
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,820
<font color="yellow">It looks very similar to mine.</font>

727
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:41,680
<font color="yellow">(On November 16, someone took my dressing table. Please return it.)</font>

728
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,820
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dad!</font>

729
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,220
<font color="yellow">Why did you pick it up from the street? We aren't poor.</font>

730
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,520
<font color="yellow">I really thought someone threw it away.</font>

731
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,850
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy.</font>

732
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,850
<font color="yellow">Why do you pick things from the street? We aren't a junk shop.</font>

733
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,650
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll put it back.</font>

734
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,390
<font color="yellow">I'll put it back, okay?</font>

735
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,320
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You might pass out again.</font>

736
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,120
<font color="yellow">Then what should I do?</font>

737
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,150
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho went out to play pool.</font>

738
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,890
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't know what to do about my dad.</font>

739
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,820
<font color="yellow">Why did he bring this home?</font>

740
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,820
<font color="yellow">Can it get rained on like this?</font>

741
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

742
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,390
<font color="yellow">Gosh, hurry up.</font>

743
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,820
<font color="yellow">Do you need a hand?</font>

744
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,420
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - It looks heavy.</font>

745
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,120
<font color="yellow">No, no. It's all right.</font>

746
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,750
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

747
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,250
<font color="yellow">Gosh, thank you.</font>

748
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,620
<font color="yellow">Which way are you going?</font>

749
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,420
<font color="yellow">If you're going this way, I can walk with you.</font>

750
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,750
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.</font>

751
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,150
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

752
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,080
<font color="yellow">People will badmouth me,</font>

753
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
<font color="yellow">saying that a guy is making a lady carry this.</font>

754
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

755
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,550
<font color="yellow">A lady?</font>

756
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,480
<font color="yellow">Let me help you.</font>

757
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,180
<font color="yellow">No, no. It's okay.</font>

758
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,280
<font color="yellow">He has such a nice voice, too.</font>

759
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,480
<font color="yellow">My crazy heart.</font>

760
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,050
<font color="yellow">Calm down already.</font>

761
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,450
<font color="yellow">He'll hear how fast you're beating.</font>

762
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,950

766
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,850

811
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,320
<font color="yellow">I feel so guilty.</font>

812

<font color="yellow">What do you mean Coach Choi made the gimbap herself?</font>

827

<font color="yellow">I'm sick.</font>

832
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,380

00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Coach Choi.</font>

836
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,720
<font color="yellow">- It's because I'm incompetent. - Please don't say that.</font>

<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

<font color="yellow">In order to save a little bit of money,</font>

839
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,150
<font color="yellow">I bought expired ingredients.</font>

841
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,250
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

842
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,450
<font color="yellow">I should've secured the budget...</font>

843
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,220
<font color="yellow">at all costs.</font>

844
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,320

850
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,120
<font color="yellow">everything from Bok Joo.</font>

851
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,180
<font color="yellow">We had no idea about the budget cut. We should've been more thoughtful.</font>

852
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,850
<font color="yellow">You know I have a big mouth.</font>

853
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,920
<font color="yellow">We had a meeting about this issue.</font>

854
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,850
<font color="yellow">We'll only have a snack every three days.</font>

855
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,720
<font color="yellow">We'll have either one row of gimbap or a burger.</font>

856
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,650
<font color="yellow">We also decided to buy some sausages...</font>

857
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,080
<font color="yellow">with our own money to snack on when we're really hungry.</font>

858
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,350
<font color="yellow">We'll get the medium size, not the large one.</font>

859
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,220
<font color="yellow">We also agreed to use toilet paper and other supplies...</font>

860
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,020
<font color="yellow">at our dormitory instead of the ones here.</font>

861
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,720
<font color="yellow">And we'll only go out for dinner together after matches.</font>

862
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,820
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo can get us 50 percent family discount at Bok Chicken.</font>

863
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,620
<font color="yellow">That'd be all.</font>

864
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,180
<font color="yellow">Gosh, these fools.</font>

865
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,020
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

866
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,580
<font color="yellow">Who said you can go ahead and have a meeting about it?</font>

867
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,550
<font color="yellow">Shall I teach you guys a lesson?</font>

868
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,520
<font color="yellow">We know that we spend the most amount of money on food and snacks.</font>

869
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,980
<font color="yellow">We took it for granted and didn't think about the cost.</font>

870
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,520
<font color="yellow">We'll be more thoughtful from now on.</font>

871
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,580
<font color="yellow">And we'll work hard!</font>

872
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,280
<font color="yellow">- We'll do our best! - We'll do our best!</font>

873
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,850
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

874
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,980
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

875
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,180
<font color="yellow">This, too, shall pass...</font>

876
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,980
<font color="yellow">and become precious memories.</font>

877
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,950
<font color="yellow">It also motivates us to work harder.</font>

878
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,280
<font color="yellow">Let's turn this around...</font>

879
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,880
<font color="yellow">by doing a great job at the tournament.</font>

880
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,920

881
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,880
<font color="yellow">- You guys are confident, right? - Yes!</font>

882
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,320

883
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,080

884
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,050
<font color="yellow">We'll aim for four.</font>

885
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,980
<font color="yellow">Let's win three. Please, guys.</font>

886
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,380
<font color="yellow">You guys better win medals.</font>

887
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,350
<font color="yellow">Here. It's coffee I brewed myself.</font>

888
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,450
<font color="yellow">The test is really long, right?</font>

889
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,350
<font color="yellow">It makes me want to throw up. It's like the college entrance exam.</font>

890
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:44,120
<font color="yellow">It's a basic test I need for the counseling. Hang in there.</font>

891
