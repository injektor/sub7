00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,156
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

160
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,126
<font color="yellow">- have any money? - Money?</font>

161
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,766
<font color="yellow">I have about 20 dollars. Why?</font>

162
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:19,456
<font color="yellow">I have exactly 11 dollars.</font>

163
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:22,326
<font color="yellow">Do you want to order a pizza?</font>

164
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,526
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

165
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:26,996
<font color="yellow">I want to get some rest.</font>

166
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:29,766
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

167
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,896
<font color="yellow">With coupons, we might have enough for a pizza.</font>

168
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:45,456
<font color="yellow">I told you that she should have quit gymnastics a long time ago.</font>

169
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,526
<font color="yellow">We even sold our house for her.</font>

170
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:51,126
<font color="yellow">If we invest more money in her,</font>

171
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,526
<font color="yellow">we'll have to move to a cheaper housing, okay?</font>

172
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,696
<font color="yellow">What can we do now?</font>

173
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:59,126
<font color="yellow">We sold our house to come this far. We can't give up now.</font>

174
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,656
<font color="yellow">She's close to being the top.</font>

175
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:01,996
<font color="yellow">Who wants her to be the top?</font>

176
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,356
<font color="yellow">It's you. It isn't what Si Ho wants.</font>

177
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,956
<font color="yellow">All of this is for her.</font>

178
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:10,496
<font color="yellow">She's underweight, undernourished, and doesn't have her period.</font>

179
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:13,156
<font color="yellow">I don't want to push my daughter this hard, either.</font>

180
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,896
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

181
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,226
<font color="yellow">Did you see a ghost or something? You seem so out of it.</font>

182
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:26,896
<font color="yellow">It's because I remembered...</font>

183
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,426
<font color="yellow">a question someone asked me yesterday.</font>

184
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,826
<font color="yellow">What question?</font>

185
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,256
<font color="yellow">One of my patients asked me...</font>

186
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,526
<font color="yellow">if I like Messi.</font>

187
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,156
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a soccer player from Argentina?</font>

188
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:39,526
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it,</font>

189
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,356
<font color="yellow">I always ask questions to my patients.</font>

190
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,696
<font color="yellow">I haven't been asked a question in a while.</font>

191
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,656
<font color="yellow">Especially about what I like.</font>

192
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:49,156
<font color="yellow">You must have been quite surprised.</font>

193
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:50,526
<font color="yellow">You don't usually talk about your patients.</font>

194
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,526
<font color="yellow">Is she pretty?</font>

195
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:56,226
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

196
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:58,256
<font color="yellow">I think she is.</font>

197
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,526
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is crazy.</font>

198
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:17,156
<font color="yellow">What am I thinking?</font>

199
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:18,956
<font color="yellow">There's no cure to being lovesick.</font>

00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,726
<font color="yellow">You might break her spine. Stop it.</font>

203
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh, are you okay?</font>

204
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:41,426
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I felt like I was bent in half.</font>

205
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,356
<font color="yellow">You've been strange since yesterday.</font>

206
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:45,426
<font color="yellow">Is something bothering you?</font>

207
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,796
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just not feeling too well.</font>

208
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,626

209
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:51,996
<font color="yellow">Something is fishy.</font>

210
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,526
<font color="yellow">Right, the mountain climbing race is tomorrow.</font>

211
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,796
<font color="yellow">I'd be flying around right now if I didn't have to worry about it.</font>

212
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:59,196

244
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:22,296

<font color="yellow">If I can be born again,</font>

246

<font color="yellow">I want to be born into a rich family.</font>

247

253
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,826

257
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:08,826
<font color="yellow">It's because of the gap...</font>

258
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:12,656
<font color="yellow">between what you want and your reality.</font>

259
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,126
<font color="yellow">Try to be a little less greedy.</font>

260

<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

261
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,856

264
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,196
<font color="yellow">Even just thinking about mountain climbing...</font>

265
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,256
<font color="yellow">is making me so upset.</font>

266

267
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,126
<font color="yellow">I'd rather do more training.</font>

00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:17,256

00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,496

270
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:21,856
<font color="yellow">gotten into gymnastics.</font>

271
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,296
<font color="yellow">That's not even funny.</font>

272
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,926
<font color="yellow">Have some conscience, will you?</font>

273
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:28,726
<font color="yellow">How about I lie and say that I have...</font>

274
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,526
<font color="yellow">- pain in my hamstring? - That won't work.</font>

275
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,626
<font color="yellow">Hyung Chul tried the same tactic, but it didn't work.</font>

<font color="yellow">- He said he has hemorrhoid. - Goodness.</font>

277
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:37,926
<font color="yellow">Hemorrhoid is nothing.</font>

278
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,466
<font color="yellow">So many people in our department have it.</font>

279
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,196
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo also had to go to a hospital because of it last year.</font>

280
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,396
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you talking about me all of a sudden?</font>

281
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,696
<font color="yellow">It's nothing to be ashamed of.</font>

282
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,896
<font color="yellow">It's like a medal to those of us who are in strenuous sports.</font>

283
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:52,096
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we can't skip it unless we have serious injuries.</font>

284
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,496
<font color="yellow">So many people tried to get out of it.</font>

285
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,726
<font color="yellow">That's why the dean wants to give prize money to the winner.</font>

286
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,226
<font color="yellow">Prize money?</font>

287
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,656
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

288
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:13,026
<font color="yellow">Was it 300 dollars? I heard that it's the dean's own money.</font>

289
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:15,396
<font color="yellow">It'll be like a little event.</font>

290
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:21,056
<font color="yellow">300 dollars is more than enough to sign up for the program.</font>

291
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,056
<font color="yellow">This is a chance for me.</font>

292
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:24,996
<font color="yellow">It's a golden opportunity.</font>

293
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,326
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

294
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,756
<font color="yellow">shall I climb that darn mountain as fast as I can?</font>

295
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,256

<font color="yellow">Who called?</font>

308
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,396
<font color="yellow">- We heard that gymnastics team won - We heard that gymnastics team won</font>

309
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:15,396
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

310
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,926
<font color="yellow">- No, no, that's a lie - No, no, that's a lie</font>

311
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:20,756
<font color="yellow">- The weightlifting team won - The weightlifting team won</font>

312
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,756
<font color="yellow">We're so awesome!</font>

313
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:36,626
<font color="yellow">Let's go, guys. Unload the bus.</font>

314
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,696
<font color="yellow">Hurry up, guys.</font>

315
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,626
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm glad that all of you are...</font>

316
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:47,026
<font color="yellow">fully recovered from food poisoning.</font>

317
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,426
<font color="yellow">Today's such a gorgeous day.</font>

318
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:52,826
<font color="yellow">I know that you guys aren't fans of mountain climbing,</font>

319
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,856
<font color="yellow">but this race is an important event.</font>

320
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,356
<font color="yellow">- You know, right? - The peak is 338.2m high.</font>

321
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:00,226
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll be sure to win...</font>

322
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,796
<font color="yellow">and make that 300 dollars mine. Then...</font>

323
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,196
<font color="yellow">Then come to me, Bok Joo.</font>

324
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,026
<font color="yellow">Then I...</font>

325
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,156
<font color="yellow">Stay strong, Bok Joo. You can do it. You got this!</font>

326
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,726
<font color="yellow">Then I will...</font>

327
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:18,296
<font color="yellow">So what are you guys going to do? You have to do your best. Got it?</font>

328
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:21,056
<font color="yellow">Listen. No matter how high the mountain is,</font>

329
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:23,056
<font color="yellow">it won't be as grand as your dreams. You know what I mean?</font>

330
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,056
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is that this is nothing hard.</font>

331
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,226
<font color="yellow">What's our biggest strength?</font>

332
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,296
<font color="yellow">It's being trampling upon... Wait.</font>

333
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,596
<font color="yellow">- What was it... - Ability to overcome obstacles.</font>

334
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,626
<font color="yellow">Yes, overcoming obstacles.</font>

335
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:35,856
<font color="yellow">We get back up no matter how harshly we're trampled upon.</font>

336
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,526
<font color="yellow">Guys, I don't even expect any of you to win today.</font>

337
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:41,756
<font color="yellow">I just want all of you to finish the race...</font>

338
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:43,296
<font color="yellow">without giving up.</font>

339
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:46,396
<font color="yellow">That's my goal as well as the challenge we must conquer today.</font>

340
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,756
<font color="yellow">Got it? I hate it when people call us fat...</font>

341
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:51,896
<font color="yellow">and assume that we'd be terrible at mountain climbing for that reason.</font>

342
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,796
<font color="yellow">As you guys know, that's total nonsense.</font>

343
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,926
<font color="yellow">Do not make me hear things like that ever again, okay?</font>

344
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,966
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Are you ready?</font>

345
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,196
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Good.</font>

346
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,726
<font color="yellow">- Are you guys feeling passionate? - Yes.</font>

347
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:03,126
<font color="yellow">All right! Go!</font>

348
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,656
<font color="yellow">- Yes, go. - Hurry up, guys.</font>

349
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:07,526
<font color="yellow">- Move, guys. Move. - Hey, Bok Joo!</font>

350
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:08,626
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

351
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:15,426
<font color="yellow">Let's go faster.</font>

352
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:23,926
<font color="yellow">Hey, watch out.</font>

353
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:25,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

354
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:27,896
<font color="yellow">- He's coming. - Ouch!</font>

355
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,356
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, are you all right?</font>

356
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,926
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ki Seok. Ki Seok.</font>

357
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:36,426
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung sprained his ankle while getting off the bus earlier.</font>

358
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,396
<font color="yellow">I don't think he can climb any more.</font>

359
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,056
<font color="yellow">- Really? Is it painful? - Yes.</font>

360
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:42,096
<font color="yellow">- Let me see. - It's this side.</font>

361
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:45,496
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you all right? Ki Seok, Ki Seok!</font>

362
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,796
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Hey, it was your left ankle.</font>

363
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,226
<font color="yellow">Stop putting on a show.</font>

364
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,126
<font color="yellow">Jeong Joon Hyung.</font>

365
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:58,656
<font color="yellow">You better not get behind me and climb all the way to the peak.</font>

366
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,196
<font color="yellow">The second you see the back of my head,</font>

367
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,796
<font color="yellow">you and all of your peers will be punished. Got it?</font>

368
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,026
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Go.</font>

369
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:09,356
<font color="yellow">- Keep climbing. - Okay.</font>

370
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:11,726
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

371
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,756
<font color="yellow">- Hey, was I too obvious? - Yes, you were.</font>

372
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,326
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo, wait up! - I can't climb any more.</font>

373
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,956
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her today? Did she eat something weird?</font>

374
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,696
<font color="yellow">I don't even know. I can't do this any more.</font>

375
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:47,896
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

376
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:51,926
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

377
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:57,126
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

378
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,096
<font color="yellow">The crazy guy is coming.</font>

379
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:01,496
<font color="yellow">Tae Kwon. I'm going first. Good luck.</font>

380
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:03,296
<font color="yellow">Hey. Wait.</font>

381
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:04,856
<font color="yellow">I'm scared, too.</font>

382
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:07,256
<font color="yellow">Frankly, I'm scared, too. Gosh.</font>

383
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,526
<font color="yellow">Hey! Wait for me.</font>

384
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,096
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chubs!</font>

385
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,726
<font color="yellow">This is surprising.</font>

386
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,696
<font color="yellow">Looking at your size, I expected you to give up.</font>

387
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,426
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if you have a strong will...</font>

388
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:40,996
<font color="yellow">or physical strength.</font>

389
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:43,456
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

390
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,056
<font color="yellow">Am I a ghost?</font>

391
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:46,356
<font color="yellow">Talk to me.</font>

392
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:49,126
<font color="yellow">I have no energy to talk.</font>

393
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,756
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

394
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,126
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're all determined.</font>

395
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,726
<font color="yellow">Are you going to win the first place?</font>

396
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,826
<font color="yellow">Way to go, Bok Joo!</font>

397
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,556
<font color="yellow">I'll give you energy!</font>

398
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:08,556
<font color="yellow">Get up there, Bok Joo!</font>

399
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:10,656
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, though.</font>

400
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,426
<font color="yellow">One,</font>

401
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:15,796
<font color="yellow">two,</font>

402
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:17,896
<font color="yellow">- Good. - three.</font>

403
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,826
<font color="yellow">Flip and kick.</font>

404
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:48,826
<font color="yellow">Chubs.</font>

405
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,756
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

406
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,996
<font color="yellow">I just don't want to carry you in case you collapse.</font>

407
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,926
<font color="yellow">You're not going to take care of me even if I hurt my back.</font>

408
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,326
<font color="yellow">Should I call for a stretcher?</font>

409
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:02,596
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

410
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,956
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

411
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,696
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Keep going.</font>

412
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:13,326
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Move it.</font>

413
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:14,456
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

414
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:16,896
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

415
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,796
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Bok Joo! - Stop!</font>

416
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,896
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo!</font>

417
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,556
<font color="yellow">Hey. My gosh.</font>

418
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,456
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

419
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,926
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

420
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,926
<font color="yellow">- It wasn't intentional. - Gosh.</font>

421
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:35,356
<font color="yellow">You seemed to be tired, so I just wanted to help you.</font>

422
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:36,896
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to help.</font>

423
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:41,226
<font color="yellow">I think someone will be here soon.</font>

424
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,196
<font color="yellow">We're offering a prize, so they would be competing hard.</font>

425
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,856
<font color="yellow">Shall we get ready, then?</font>

426
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:53,896
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

427
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,396
<font color="yellow">Hey. I'm sorry.</font>

428
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,426
<font color="yellow">You seemed so tired, so I was trying to help you.</font>

429
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,596
<font color="yellow">What? Are you going to head-butt me again?</font>

430
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,526
<font color="yellow">- Hold on to me. It'd be easier. - Gosh.</font>

431
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:15,196
<font color="yellow">Hold on to me.</font>

432
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:16,896
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

433
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:20,526
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

434
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,326
<font color="yellow">Hey. Get on my back, then.</font>

435
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,726
<font color="yellow">I made you fall, so I'll carry you.</font>

436
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,196
<font color="yellow">I'll just hurt my back at worst.</font>

437
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:36,196
<font color="yellow">Get on.</font>

438
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:44,856
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo!</font>

439
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:46,326
<font color="yellow">I'm hurt.</font>

440
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:48,626
<font color="yellow">My knee hurts.</font>

441
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:54,156
<font color="yellow">She won't look back at all.</font>

442
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:18,796
<font color="yellow">So many have come already.</font>

443
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:22,826
<font color="yellow">Well, they're athletes.</font>

444
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,456
<font color="yellow">I guess they're competitive.</font>

445
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,296
<font color="yellow">They offered a prize.</font>

446
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:28,826
<font color="yellow">That's gone.</font>

447
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:31,156
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

448
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,096
<font color="yellow">Let's get your ankle treated.</font>

449
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:35,956
<font color="yellow">- You should put ice on the... - Get lost.</font>

450
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,796
<font color="yellow">- What? - I said get lost!</font>

451
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,726
<font color="yellow">We're not friends. We just went to the same school.</font>

452
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,356
<font color="yellow">Why are you hovering being nosy?</font>

453
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,426
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

454
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,096
<font color="yellow">You ruined everything.</font>

455
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:05,556
<font color="yellow">Did she have to be mean like that?</font>

456
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,496
<font color="yellow">Hey. What do you want to eat?</font>

457
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,556
<font color="yellow">Jokbal? Bossam?</font>

458
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:15,156
<font color="yellow">Should we have some beer with chicken, sausages,</font>

459
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,826
<font color="yellow">and French fries?</font>

460
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,056
<font color="yellow">The last one sounds good.</font>

461
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,226
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat until we can't. - I'd like that.</font>

462
00:28:20,926 --> 00:28:22,196
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. Which one do you want?</font>

463
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:25,856
<font color="yellow">What? I don't have an appetite.</font>

464
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:29,096
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Seon Ok. Did I hear her right?</font>

465
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:31,026
<font color="yellow">Did she say she doesn't have an appetite?</font>

466
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:33,956
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You said your ankle is fine.</font>

467
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:37,726
<font color="yellow">- You made it to the top. It's good. - She's right.</font>

468
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:41,226
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

469
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:43,756
<font color="yellow">It's our night out in a long time. Don't be like this.</font>

470
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,126
<font color="yellow">Come on now.</font>

471
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,296
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Bok Joo.</font>

472
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,196
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

473
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:56,456
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry that my stomach is flat.</font>

474
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,326
<font color="yellow">Come on, Bok Joo. She won't stop.</font>

475
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,326
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

476
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:03,896
<font color="yellow">Let's eat the things you just said. Be quiet.</font>

477
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,956
<font color="yellow">How long do we have to put up with this?</font>

478
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:11,896
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers!</font>

479
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,756
<font color="yellow">Drink up! I don't need anything else.</font>

480
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:15,796
<font color="yellow">I have you guys.</font>

481
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,426
<font color="yellow">That's right. Now you sound like yourself.</font>

482
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,456
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo is finishing her beer. Awesome.</font>

483
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:26,856
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

484
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:30,156
<font color="yellow">To your healthy weight loss.</font>

485
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:31,996
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

486
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:37,696
<font color="yellow">- Hey. Slow down. You'll get drunk. - Gosh.</font>

487
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,726
<font color="yellow">This is her third glass.</font>

488
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,356
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, she's drinking too fast.</font>

489
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,256
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Slow down.</font>

490
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:47,226
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's our night out in such a long time.</font>

491
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:49,996
<font color="yellow">We won't get to drink for a while.</font>

492
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:52,626
<font color="yellow">- Right? - Ouch.</font>

493
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,626
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Hey, budge up.</font>

494
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:58,156
<font color="yellow">Fine. All right.</font>

495
00:29:58,156 --> 00:29:59,426
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

496
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:01,926
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

497
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:03,996
<font color="yellow">What should we do? She's doing it again.</font>

498
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:05,196
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry and eat.</font>

499
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:10,126
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take a selfie.</font>

500
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:21,826
<font color="yellow">Have you talked to Joon Hyung?</font>

501
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,626
<font color="yellow">He was disqualified. Is he okay?</font>

502
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,626
<font color="yellow">He'll have a counseling with my friend.</font>

503
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,326
<font color="yellow">Really? Gosh. That's a relief.</font>

504
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,756
<font color="yellow">That's good. We were worried,</font>

505
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,426
<font color="yellow">but we tried not to show.</font>

506
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:36,926
<font color="yellow">Mental training is important to athletes.</font>

507
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,226
<font color="yellow">- It will help him. - Oh, my.</font>

508
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:42,526
<font color="yellow">Speak of the devil.</font>

509
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:44,796
<font color="yellow">Hello, Joon Hyung?</font>

510
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:46,796
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

511
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:50,996
<font color="yellow">We're having octopus... No, I meant pancakes.</font>

512
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,296
<font color="yellow">I just ate dinner with Tae Kwon.</font>

513
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,696
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to be late.</font>

514
00:30:59,896 --> 00:31:02,526
<font color="yellow">I know you miss me. Just wait a little longer.</font>

515
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:03,796
<font color="yellow">I love you, Mom.</font>

516
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,296
<font color="yellow">Is she your mom or girlfriend?</font>

517
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:10,156
<font color="yellow">You're quite a mama's boy.</font>

518
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:13,756
<font color="yellow">I am. I love my mom so much.</font>

519
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,856
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

520
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:20,226
<font color="yellow">I love taking selfies</font>

521
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:23,596
<font color="yellow">Taking selfies makes me pretty</font>

522
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,126
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

523
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:31,956
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Oh, boy. What should I do?</font>

524
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,896
<font color="yellow">- I'm so sorry. - Goodness.</font>

525
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,156
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.</font>

526
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:39,396
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.</font>

527
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,656
<font color="yellow">Do something about your drinking problem.</font>

528
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:43,426
<font color="yellow">Let them be. They'll ruin the mood.</font>

529
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:46,726
<font color="yellow">- Sit down. - Girls should just stay home.</font>

530
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:47,956
<font color="yellow">Why are they drinking outside?</font>

531
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:51,256
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't bother others when you're drinking.</font>

532
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,156
<font color="yellow">I can see what will become of you.</font>

533
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:54,796
<font color="yellow">We'll be weightlifters.</font>

534
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,956
<font color="yellow">Gosh. If you were my sister,</font>

535
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:01,126
<font color="yellow">I'd shave your head and lock you up.</font>

536
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,126
<font color="yellow">What did you say to my friend?</font>

537
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,796
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

538
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,956
<font color="yellow">I said what I wanted to say. Do you have a problem?</font>

539
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,156
<font color="yellow">How dare you.</font>

540
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:12,826
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

541
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:14,796
<font color="yellow">You're athletes.</font>

542
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:17,026
<font color="yellow">No wonder.</font>

543
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,356
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

544
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,326
<font color="yellow">Those losers don't know anything.</font>

545
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:24,126
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

546
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:25,496
<font color="yellow">- Losers? - Losers?</font>

547
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,026
<font color="yellow">Let's see who the real losers are.</font>

548
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,026
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Bok Joo.</font>

549
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:33,726
<font color="yellow">- Darn it. - Calm down. Calm down.</font>

550
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:37,326
<font color="yellow">Hey. The girls here don't look so nice.</font>

551
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:40,396
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. Let's just have a quick drink.</font>

552
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,096
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

553
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:46,996
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Don't get upset.</font>

554
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,696
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - Look.</font>

555
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:51,526
<font color="yellow">You're such cowards to talk about us behind our back.</font>

556
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:54,326
<font color="yellow">Isn't she a weightlifter whom you went to school with?</font>

557
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:56,826
<font color="yellow">- Stop it, let's go. - I can't believe this.</font>

558
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:59,096
<font color="yellow">I don't want to fight with you. Just apologize and leave.</font>

559
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:00,696
<font color="yellow">I already apologized. Get lost.</font>

560
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:03,396
<font color="yellow">What did you say? How dare you being rude to me?</font>

561
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,596
<font color="yellow">- Get lost. - I'm not getting lost.</font>

562
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:07,356
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - You are the worst.</font>

563
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,326
<font color="yellow">- You're worse. - Stop it.</font>

564
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:11,396
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what should I do?</font>

565
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:13,756
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. - Get out of here.</font>

566
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:16,696
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, he's so rude. - What?</font>

567
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:18,226
<font color="yellow">You're not a woman.</font>

568
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,856
<font color="yellow">- Then am I a man? - You're uglier than a man.</font>

569
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:23,656
<font color="yellow">- Your face is worse. - Oh, my gosh.</font>

570
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:26,496
<font color="yellow">- Don't look down on women. - Stop it.</font>

571
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,796
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

572
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,626
<font color="yellow">- You're such aggressive women. - Hey, let's go.</font>

573
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:34,426
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'll go easy on you because you're a woman?</font>

574
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,156
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

575
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,496
<font color="yellow">- Who cares if you're an athlete? - What does that have to do with it?</font>

576
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,456
<font color="yellow">- You swore at us first. - Stop it.</font>

577
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,726
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

578
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:45,096
<font color="yellow">She might even punch me.</font>

579
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:48,196
<font color="yellow">Punch me. Come on, punch me.</font>

580
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,496
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

581
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,726
<font color="yellow">You have a flat chest anyway.</font>

582
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:55,356
<font color="yellow">You don't even look like a woman.</font>

583
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:02,696
<font color="yellow">What? You punk!</font>

584
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:04,196
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Gosh.</font>

585
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:07,256
<font color="yellow">- You punk, what did you say? - Let me go.</font>

586
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,296
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Let me go.</font>

587
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,556
<font color="yellow">You punks, I'm also a woman.</font>

588
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:15,456
<font color="yellow">- I'm still a woman even if I'm fat. - Let it go.</font>

589
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:18,026
<font color="yellow">- How dare you hit me? - Goodness.</font>

590
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,756
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

591
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:22,056
<font color="yellow">- You, come here. - Goodness.</font>

592
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:23,896
<font color="yellow">- Hey, stop it. - Just leave.</font>

593
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:24,926
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

594
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:27,156
<font color="yellow">- Come on, stop it. - I'm sorry.</font>

595
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:28,656
<font color="yellow">You'd better watch it.</font>

596
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:31,596
<font color="yellow">- Don't stop me. - Come on, let's go.</font>

597
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,196
<font color="yellow">They deserve to be punched.</font>

598
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

599
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,926
<font color="yellow">Stand up straight. You need to sober up.</font>

600
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:41,126
<font color="yellow">Have a seat over there.</font>

601
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:46,396
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'm sober now.</font>

602
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:48,456
<font color="yellow">I'm completely sober. See?</font>

603
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,026
<font color="yellow">Put this on. It's cold.</font>

604
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:05,056
<font color="yellow">What a mess.</font>

605
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,656
<font color="yellow">I wanted us to have a good time away from school.</font>

606
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,596
<font color="yellow">Those punks!</font>

607
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:16,496
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I lost my temper again.</font>

608
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:19,026
<font color="yellow">You should be careful. What if you got hit?</font>

609
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:22,396
<font color="yellow">We're weightlifters, but they were still men.</font>

610
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:23,996
<font color="yellow">They looked like punks.</font>

611
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,926
<font color="yellow">They were being so rude.</font>

612
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:28,956
<font color="yellow">You guys are a mess.</font>

613
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:31,056
<font color="yellow">One likes to fight while the other is drunk.</font>

614
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,896
<font color="yellow">I'm never letting her drink ever again.</font>

615
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:36,866
<font color="yellow">Gosh,</font>

616
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,226
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold.</font>

617
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:42,326
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold.</font>

618
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:44,626
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

619
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:46,996
<font color="yellow">Drink this and let it go.</font>

620
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,496
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that was close.</font>

621
00:35:49,496 --> 00:35:51,156
<font color="yellow">I was close to punching a girl.</font>

622
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,826
<font color="yellow">Be careful with your words.</font>

623
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:54,796
<font color="yellow">They were gangsters, not girls.</font>

624
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,326
<font color="yellow">I hate women who are aggressive like them.</font>

625
00:35:58,326 --> 00:35:59,696
<font color="yellow">Even if they were easy, I'd reject them.</font>

626
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:03,426
<font color="yellow">- Are you being serious? - One of them was okay.</font>

627
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:06,756
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

628
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,596
<font color="yellow">Women like them can be attractive in a different way.</font>

629
00:36:09,596 --> 00:36:11,026
<font color="yellow">They may be tough at first,</font>

630
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:14,426
<font color="yellow">but then they become submissive.</font>

631
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,256
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean.</font>

632
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,326
<font color="yellow">Do you know Kyung Shik?</font>

633
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:20,556
<font color="yellow">His girlfriend is manly and has a big build.</font>

634
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,396
<font color="yellow">Kyung Shik says that she's amazing.</font>

635
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,996
<font color="yellow">Come on, be more specific.</font>

636
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:28,656
<font color="yellow">Compared to skinny girls...</font>

637
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:30,426
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - What?</font>

638
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,296
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

639
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:42,396
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee, are you okay?</font>

640
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,896
<font color="yellow">- Have you sobered up? - Yes.</font>

641
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:47,596
<font color="yellow">I feel much better now.</font>

642
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,056
<font color="yellow">She's sober now that she can talk. She looks better.</font>

643
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,656
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Let's go.</font>

644
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:54,256
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired today.</font>

645
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:57,296
<font color="yellow">- Hey, you. - Gosh, I'm tired.</font>

646
00:36:57,296 --> 00:36:59,126
<font color="yellow">- Run. Let's go! - What?</font>

647
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:01,296
<font color="yellow">- Run, run! - What's going on?</font>

648
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:03,756
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - What's going on?</font>

649
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:05,996
<font color="yellow">Come on, hurry up.</font>

650
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:08,026
<font color="yellow">- Run faster. - Stop right there.</font>

651
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:10,296
<font color="yellow">Just wait until I catch you!</font>

652
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:14,156
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go.</font>

653
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:16,866
<font color="yellow">How much more do we have to run?</font>

654
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,526
<font color="yellow">You go that way.</font>

655
00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:22,366
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Go this way.</font>

656
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,226
<font color="yellow">Come on, hurry up.</font>

657
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:26,896
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

658
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:28,656
<font color="yellow">Where did those punks go?</font>

659
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,696
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did they go?</font>

660
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,196
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

661
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:36,296
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

662
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:39,626
<font color="yellow">You guys go that way. Let's go this way.</font>

663
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:42,896
<font color="yellow">- Why don't we go this way? - That's what I said.</font>

664
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,296
<font color="yellow">- Come and follow me. - Gosh.</font>

665
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,056
<font color="yellow">Again?</font>

666
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:52,996
<font color="yellow">- They're leaving. - Let's go.</font>

667
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:55,366
<font color="yellow">That must hurt.</font>

668
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:10,756
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

669
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,026
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go.</font>

670
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:28,526
<font color="yellow">Hey, look.</font>

671
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:31,156
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

672
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,696
<font color="yellow">All that running made me nauseous.</font>

673
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,896
<font color="yellow">Is your ankle okay?</font>

674
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,396
<font color="yellow">I feel a little pain, but it's okay.</font>

675
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:58,796
<font color="yellow">Why did we run away?</font>

676
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,826
<font color="yellow">I wonder why I ran away with you.</font>

677
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,896
<font color="yellow">I must have lost my mind.</font>

678
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:09,996
<font color="yellow">When did you get there?</font>

679
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,026
<font color="yellow">Did you see what happened?</font>

680
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:17,596
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

681
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:19,296
<font color="yellow">Did you get into a fight...</font>

682
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:21,556
<font color="yellow">because of me?</font>

683
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:25,656
<font color="yellow">Why would I get into a fight because of you?</font>

684
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,996
<font color="yellow">You may not know this,</font>

685
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:32,196
<font color="yellow">but I'm not that loyal. I don't meddle in other people's business.</font>

686
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:35,526
<font color="yellow">Stay out of other people's business while others stay out of mine.</font>

687
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:37,256
<font color="yellow">That's my motto in life.</font>

688
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:39,596
<font color="yellow">Then why did you run away?</font>

689
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:41,956
<font color="yellow">Wasn't it because you got into a fight?</font>

690
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:44,996
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

691
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:47,726
<font color="yellow">I must have been too handsome because...</font>

692
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:48,826
<font color="yellow">they kept giving me looks.</font>

693
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,366
<font color="yellow">I understand that they were out to have some good time,</font>

694
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:54,926
<font color="yellow">but all women were looking at me.</font>

695
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:57,896
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

696
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,196
<font color="yellow">I can't have a serious conversation with you.</font>

697
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:06,896
<font color="yellow">Anyway, now that I ran for a long time,</font>

698
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:08,296
<font color="yellow">I have less on my mind.</font>

699
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:10,256
<font color="yellow">Thanks, friend.</font>

700
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,126
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

701
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:21,626
<font color="yellow">By the way, what was on your mind?</font>

702
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:26,426
<font color="yellow">- Is it something complicated? - What if it is?</font>

703
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:27,866
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you about it?</font>

704
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,256
<font color="yellow">I don't think we're close enough to have a deep conversation.</font>

705
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,526
<font color="yellow">I have to agree with that.</font>

706
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:41,126
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one question.</font>

707
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,796
<font color="yellow">Has your personality changed,</font>

708
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:46,696
<font color="yellow">or do I remember you in a wrong way?</font>

709
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:49,956
<font color="yellow">Of course I have changed.</font>

710
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,196
<font color="yellow">I can't survive in this world if I'm still that shy.</font>

711
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:55,726
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

712
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,026
<font color="yellow">Aren't I more attractive than before?</font>

713
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,126
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

714
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:05,756
<font color="yellow">Stop it, get that face away from me.</font>

715
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:07,826
<font color="yellow">Your chin is too pointy.</font>

716
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:31,496
<font color="yellow">Speaking of what's on your mind,</font>

717
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,496
<font color="yellow">don't force yourself to come to a conclusion.</font>

718
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,556
<font color="yellow">Based on my experience,</font>

719
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:39,796
<font color="yellow">time solves everything.</font>

720
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:41,896
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

721
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:50,526
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

722
00:41:51,196 --> 00:41:52,256
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo!</font>

723
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:53,796
<font color="yellow">Come out now.</font>

724
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:56,926
<font color="yellow">Why is he being so loud?</font>

725
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:06,756
<font color="yellow">Why are you being loud so early in the morning?</font>

726
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:09,796
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

727
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:13,326
<font color="yellow">Dae Ho, what's that?</font>

728
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,296
<font color="yellow">Can't you see what it is?</font>

729
00:42:16,596 --> 00:42:18,326
<font color="yellow">It's a scooter.</font>

730
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:21,256
<font color="yellow">It's used, but it doesn't have much mileage.</font>

731
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:22,896
<font color="yellow">It's as good as new.</font>

732
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:26,026
<font color="yellow">By the way, I disposed our old scooter.</font>

733
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:28,126
<font color="yellow">No one was willing to take such junk,</font>

734
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:30,226
<font color="yellow">so I barely sold it for 100 dollars.</font>

735
00:42:31,096 --> 00:42:33,196
<font color="yellow">How did you get the money to buy this?</font>

736
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:35,926
<font color="yellow">I complained to my boss.</font>

737
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:38,496
<font color="yellow">I told him to pay me for the work I've done.</font>

738
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:40,896
<font color="yellow">If not, I said I'll complain to the broadcasting station.</font>

739
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:43,896
<font color="yellow">If you get on his bad side, he might not give you more work.</font>

740
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:47,366
<font color="yellow">I don't even think I have the talent for acting. I'll just quit.</font>

741
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:51,456
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I don't want to talk about it.</font>

742
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:52,926
<font color="yellow">So? What do you think?</font>

743
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,196
<font color="yellow">If you get on this scooter...</font>

744
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:58,596
<font color="yellow">and ride it like this, you'll look so cool.</font>

745
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:02,226
<font color="yellow">Uncle! I must say, you're so cool today.</font>

746
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,226
<font color="yellow">You're super charismatic.</font>

747
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:08,756
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

748
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,156
<font color="yellow">I do like it.</font>

749
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:14,556
<font color="yellow">Isn't it so shiny?</font>

750
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,096
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Come on.</font>

751
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:31,956
<font color="yellow">Let's just take a look. It'll be quick.</font>

752
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:35,256
<font color="yellow">- Let's go inside. - We're running late. Let's just go.</font>

753
00:43:35,256 --> 00:43:36,726
<font color="yellow">- Hello! - Hello.</font>

754
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,866
<font color="yellow">Let's just browse. We won't buy anything.</font>

755
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:43,596
<font color="yellow">This must be a new model.</font>

756
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:46,156
<font color="yellow">- Let's get matching shoes. - No, let's go.</font>

757
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,656
<font color="yellow">- Why not? - Why should we get the same shoes?</font>

758
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:49,856
<font color="yellow">I hate that. It makes me cringe.</font>

759
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:52,056
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Come on.</font>

760
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,056
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

761
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:55,126
<font color="yellow">Okay, all right. Let go of me, then.</font>

762
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:56,356
<font color="yellow">- You won't get them, right? - No.</font>

763
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:58,056
<font color="yellow">- Promise? - Yes.</font>

764
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:00,556
<font color="yellow">Goodness, hey.</font>

765
00:44:01,756 --> 00:44:03,956
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Gosh, all right.</font>

766
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,026
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

767
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:07,726
<font color="yellow">- Let's go now. - Let's get matching shoes!</font>

768
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:09,356
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - I'll be back soon!</font>

769
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,756
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you talking about?</font>

770
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,526
<font color="yellow">That one would also look good...</font>

771
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,396
<font color="yellow">on Joon Hyung.</font>

772
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:52,326
<font color="yellow">It's certainly faster. It took at least five minutes less.</font>

773
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:53,426
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

774
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,456
<font color="yellow">I must say, this new scooter is great.</font>

775
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:58,056
<font color="yellow">Don't drive too fast, though.</font>

776
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,726
<font color="yellow">And be careful when you make a turn, okay?</font>

777
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:01,496
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am. Sure thing.</font>

778
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:03,626
<font color="yellow">Thanks for giving me a ride, Dad. See you later.</font>

779
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:07,226
<font color="yellow">Here, take this.</font>

780
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:09,156
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

781
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:12,656
<font color="yellow">You seemed so down the last time I saw you.</font>

782
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:15,096
<font color="yellow">Don't spend all of your time on training. Be sure to de-stress, too.</font>

783
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,326
<font color="yellow">Go out for delicious food with friends, and go shopping, too.</font>

784
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,656
<font color="yellow">You should also go clubbing like other girls.</font>

785
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:23,426
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I don't need this.</font>

786
00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:26,096
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Just take it, you silly.</font>

787
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:28,356
<font color="yellow">I was thinking of getting a new scooter,</font>

788
00:45:28,956 --> 00:45:30,856
<font color="yellow">but your uncle got this for me.</font>

789
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,026
<font color="yellow">Stress is bad for athletes.</font>

790
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:34,756
<font color="yellow">Go out and de-stress. You have to.</font>

791
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:38,256
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Your uncle will visit the hospital from now on,</font>

792
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:40,126
<font color="yellow">so don't worry and just focus on your training.</font>

793
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:42,526
<font color="yellow">We don't get that many customers during the day,</font>

794
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:44,826
<font color="yellow">so let's just do that. All right? I'm should get going now.</font>

795
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,126
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

796
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:52,096
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, I'm rooting for you!</font>

797
00:45:55,996 --> 00:45:56,996
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

798
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:13,026
<font color="yellow">Watch my parkour stunt!</font>

799
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:14,456
<font color="yellow">You silly.</font>

800
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,796
<font color="yellow">Gosh, here we go again. My shoulders are hurting so much.</font>

801
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:23,596
<font color="yellow">Build more muscles unless you want it to be dislocated all the time.</font>

802
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:26,526
<font color="yellow">I know, too. I'm just lazy, that's all.</font>

803
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:31,196
<font color="yellow">My darling, you're the only one who's worried about me.</font>

804
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:32,356
<font color="yellow">Get off of me, you idiot.</font>

805
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,096
<font color="yellow">What's your problem? Get more of this!</font>

806
00:46:34,656 --> 00:46:37,026
<font color="yellow">You're dead! I'm going to catch you!</font>

807
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:39,256
<font color="yellow">Come here. Come with me.</font>

808
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:42,026
<font color="yellow">- You're so dead. - No! I have to pick up my package.</font>

809
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,196
<font color="yellow">- What? Don't lie to my face. - I'm serious.</font>

810
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:47,956
<font color="yellow">- Ouch! Let go of me! - Gosh, I'm not lying.</font>

811
00:46:48,396 --> 00:46:50,626
<font color="yellow">I'm expecting the swim trunk I bought.</font>

812
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:52,656
<font color="yellow">Hey, you did more shopping?</font>

813
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:55,256
<font color="yellow">- What? - Aren't you worried about your dad?</font>

814
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:56,496
<font color="yellow">Can you keep on splurging like this?</font>

815
00:46:56,496 --> 00:46:57,656
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry, my friend.</font>

816
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,996
<font color="yellow">They say that the rich never goes flat broke.</font>

817
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,896
<font color="yellow">What's there to life, anyway?</font>

818
00:47:01,896 --> 00:47:04,296
<font color="yellow">You have to live today as if there's no tomorrow.</font>

819
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,256
<font color="yellow">There's something for you.</font>

820
00:47:07,996 --> 00:47:10,326
<font color="yellow">Look at this. It says "Jeong Joon Hyung".</font>

821
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:11,526
<font color="yellow">I'm not expecting anything.</font>

822
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,326
<font color="yellow">It's actually a little odd.</font>

823
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:16,696
<font color="yellow">There's no address written. All it has is your name.</font>

824
00:47:39,496 --> 00:47:41,696
<font color="yellow">(Korea Gymnastics Association)</font>

825
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:47,596
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Hyung.</font>

826
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:12,226
<font color="yellow">I guess you were practicing.</font>

827
00:48:17,926 --> 00:48:18,926
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

828
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:22,926
<font color="yellow">You figured it out.</font>

829
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:26,396
<font color="yellow">You're the only person who'd send me things like this.</font>

830
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:30,126
<font color="yellow">If I'm the only person, can you just keep them and wear them?</font>

831
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:33,826
<font color="yellow">You do have a point.</font>

832
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:37,596
<font color="yellow">I thought about keeping them for a very brief moment,</font>

833
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:41,156
<font color="yellow">but I don't think I can accept this from you.</font>

834
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:44,856
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

835
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,356
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it'd make you that uncomfortable.</font>

836
00:48:49,856 --> 00:48:50,856
<font color="yellow">Point taken.</font>

837
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:52,796
<font color="yellow">I better get going now.</font>

838
00:49:13,156 --> 00:49:14,296
<font color="yellow">No, you crazy wench.</font>

839
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,026
<font color="yellow">You're really crazy if you sign up with this money.</font>

840
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:19,226
<font color="yellow">All Dad does is worry about you.</font>

841
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:23,056
<font color="yellow">He had to drive on that old scooter so many times to earn this money.</font>

842
00:49:24,496 --> 00:49:25,956
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, don't do anything you'll regret.</font>

843
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:39,556
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is so boring.</font>

844
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:41,696
<font color="yellow">We can't even have beer.</font>

845
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:42,996
<font color="yellow">Have some conscience, will you?</font>

846
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,656
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare talk about alcohol for the next little while.</font>

847
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:53,526
<font color="yellow">- Girls. - Yes, Bok Joo. What is it?</font>

848
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:55,696
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

849
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,626
<font color="yellow">I'm going to train so hard.</font>

850
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:00,556
<font color="yellow">You already practice hard enough.</font>

851
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:03,256
<font color="yellow">- You practice the hardest among us. - That's right.</font>

852
00:50:03,596 --> 00:50:04,626
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

853
00:50:05,196 --> 00:50:06,896
<font color="yellow">I've been so lax lately.</font>

854
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:09,426
<font color="yellow">I'm going to focus now...</font>

855
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:12,496
<font color="yellow">and train a hundred times harder.</font>

856
00:50:13,656 --> 00:50:14,726
<font color="yellow">Wow, a hundred times harder.</font>

857
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:17,456
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo might go to Taereung this year, don't you think?</font>

858
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:19,596
<font color="yellow">Yes. Taereung will be a piece of cake.</font>

859
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:21,526
<font color="yellow">- She'll win a gold medal. - Exactly.</font>

860
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:27,156
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Bok Joo!</font>

861
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,056
<font color="yellow">I'm a rising star of weightlifting, Kim Bok Joo.</font>

862
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:32,796
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'm going to focus on training!</font>

863
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:36,096
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got this. I can do it!</font>

864
00:50:36,926 --> 00:50:39,296
<font color="yellow">Hey, we heard everything. Kim Bok Joo!</font>

865
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:42,126
<font color="yellow">I'm a rising star of weightlifting, Kim Bok Joo. Got it?</font>

866
00:50:42,356 --> 00:50:43,496
<font color="yellow">- I can do it! - Gosh, keep it down.</font>

867
00:50:43,496 --> 00:50:47,126
<font color="yellow">That's right. It's not like I ever had a guy in my life.</font>

868
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:49,856
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Bok Joo! I'm Kim Bok Joo.</font>

869
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:51,796
<font color="yellow">I'm sure this is just a fleeting happening.</font>

870
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:54,226
<font color="yellow">Time will take care of everything.</font>

871
00:50:55,456 --> 00:50:57,926
<font color="yellow">I hope time flies by. I really do.</font>

872
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,396
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Bok Joo!</font>

873
00:50:59,396 --> 00:51:00,396
<font color="yellow">Fly, time. Fly.</font>

874
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:17,156
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo. That's it. Focus on breathing.</font>

875
00:51:18,096 --> 00:51:19,156
<font color="yellow">Lift! Don't forget to breathe.</font>

876
00:51:20,926 --> 00:51:22,496
<font color="yellow">- You got this! - You're doing great, Bok Joo.</font>

877
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:24,856
<font color="yellow">- Hold it. - Go, Bok Joo!</font>

878
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,826
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that was awesome.</font>

879
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:31,326
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, you seem so determined.</font>

880
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:33,426
<font color="yellow">Our team hasn't won a gold medal for a long time.</font>

881
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:35,556
<font color="yellow">Let's root for her to win one!</font>

882
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:38,296
<font color="yellow">- Go for it, Bok Joo! - You can do it!</font>

883
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:39,426
<font color="yellow">You can do it!</font>

884
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:42,426
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, I'm hungry. - I know that you're taller than us,</font>

885
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:44,656
<font color="yellow">- but don't do this. - What? I can't hear you.</font>

886
00:51:44,756 --> 00:51:47,156
<font color="yellow">- For goodness' sake. - Hey, what do you girls think...</font>

887
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:48,526
<font color="yellow">about me getting the double lid surgery?</font>

888
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:50,856
<font color="yellow">- How do I look? - You look like a celebrity.</font>

889
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,026
<font color="yellow">Park Myung Soo, that is!</font>

890
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,096
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

891
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:56,326
<font color="yellow">- How can you say that? - Are we not going to eat?</font>

892
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:57,396
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I'm hungry. - I'm starving.</font>

893
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,726
<font color="yellow">Today's menu is omelet rice.</font>

894
00:51:58,726 --> 00:52:00,126
<font color="yellow">- Omelet rice, again? - Why again?</font>

895
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:02,226
<font color="yellow">- I don't want it. - We had it last week.</font>

896
00:52:02,226 --> 00:52:03,896
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Gosh, please!</font>

897
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:05,326
<font color="yellow">Omelet rice is delicious.</font>

898
00:52:05,326 --> 00:52:06,656
<font color="yellow">Hey, celebrity. Take us out for barbecue.</font>

899
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,956
<font color="yellow">- Yes, you should. - Thanks in advance.</font>

900
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:09,026
<font color="yellow">- You girls! - Let's go.</font>

901
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,426
<font color="yellow">- Let's go eat! - Let's go!</font>

902
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:14,626
<font color="yellow">It looks like Chubs is in a good mood.</font>

903
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:18,326
<font color="yellow">You have to join the national team when you're back from Russia.</font>

904
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:19,826
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

905
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:21,956
<font color="yellow">Hey, Si Ho.</font>

906
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:24,326
<font color="yellow">I'll come back in a bit.</font>

907
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:25,626
<font color="yellow">Just talk to me now.</font>

908
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:28,226
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

909
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,256
<font color="yellow">Did you speak to your mom about it?</font>

910
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:38,996
<font color="yellow">Yes. I don't think I'll be able to do it this time.</font>

911
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:42,056
<font color="yellow">Why is that? Is it because you can't afford it?</font>

912
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,626
<font color="yellow">Did she say that it's too expensive?</font>
