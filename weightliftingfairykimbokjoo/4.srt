<font color="yellow">Yes. It's 590 dollars.</font>

6
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:51,338

00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,768
<font color="yellow">I won't count it.</font>

00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,098
<font color="yellow">then she devoured a box of sweet potatoes a day.</font>

00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,698

58
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:45,198
<font color="yellow">And it'll probably rain tonight. Don't forget to take an umbrella.</font>

59
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,338
<font color="yellow">Oh, your umbrella.</font>

60
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,168
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to give it back to you in the next session.</font>

61
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:54,398
<font color="yellow">I wasn't asking for my umbrella. Did it sound that way?</font>

62
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:56,368
<font color="yellow">No. It didn't,</font>

63
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,368
<font color="yellow">but I should give it back to you anyway.</font>

64
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:02,608
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

65
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,268
<font color="yellow">Get home safe.</font>

66
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:37,968
<font color="yellow">How do I wear this?</font>

67
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,768
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

68
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:43,038
<font color="yellow">try this instead? It'll look better on you.</font>

69
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,698
<font color="yellow">It's pretty. Take a look in the mirror.</font>

70
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,268
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it look bad?</font>

71
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:00,868
<font color="yellow">You look much prettier and more feminine.</font>

72
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:06,868
<font color="yellow">I'll take this.</font>

73
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,238
<font color="yellow">I'll wrap it for you.</font>

74
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,598
<font color="yellow">Do you make those yourself?</font>

75
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:18,338
<font color="yellow">I either sell them or give them as gifts.</font>

76
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,638
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's polite to return the umbrella by itself.</font>

77
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:31,868
<font color="yellow">- Are you dating someone? - Excuse me?</font>

78
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,768
<font color="yellow">- No. - Why can't you maintain the weight?</font>

79
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,168
<font color="yellow">You aren't going out on dates, are you?</font>

80
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,938
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do with you.</font>

81
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:45,838
<font color="yellow">You won't go to Russia. You can't keep your weight down.</font>

82
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,138
<font color="yellow">How will you join the national team?</font>

83
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,438
<font color="yellow">You need to have more sense of urgency.</font>

84
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,538
<font color="yellow">I understand. I'll take better care of myself.</font>

85
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:55,668
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

86
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:58,438
<font color="yellow">Come on. I want some, too.</font>

87
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,368
<font color="yellow">It's so sweet.</font>

88
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,338
<font color="yellow">Let's hide it and eat it again later.</font>

89
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,368
<font color="yellow">Of course, we'll eat it.</font>

90
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,098
<font color="yellow">- Of course. - We can't waste any.</font>

91
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,798
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's going on with Si Ho?</font>

92
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:12,968
<font color="yellow">She's gotten slow.</font>

93
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,768
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, she barged into the boys' dormitory...</font>

94
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,438
<font color="yellow">and cried in front of her ex-boyfriend.</font>

95
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,768
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

96
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,538
<font color="yellow">Is she in shock because she didn't make the national team?</font>

97
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:24,438
<font color="yellow">- I've never seen Coach scold her. - Me, neither.</font>

98
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,038
<font color="yellow">Si Ho had always been our coach's favorite.</font>

99
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:30,298
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for Si Ho.</font>

100
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:33,868
<font color="yellow">- Why? - She's not as agile due to her age.</font>

101
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,838
<font color="yellow">She isn't as good as before.</font>

102
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,398
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have financial support from her parents, either.</font>

103
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,138
<font color="yellow">Why not? Isn't her family rich?</font>

104
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,438
<font color="yellow">You have no idea, do you?</font>

105
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:44,498
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

106
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,338
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't even believe what happened today.</font>

107
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,838
<font color="yellow">- What? - What happened?</font>

108
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,638
<font color="yellow">I went to see our coach earlier today.</font>

109
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,098
<font color="yellow">Then I saw Si Ho...</font>

110
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,538
<font color="yellow">coming towards us like she was upset, so...</font>

111
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,838
<font color="yellow">It's true that I barged in the boys' dormitory,</font>

112
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,798
<font color="yellow">but I didn't cry.</font>

113
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:08,098
<font color="yellow">People made it too dramatic.</font>

114
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:16,868
<font color="yellow">Soo Bin.</font>

115
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,568
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

116
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,138
<font color="yellow">Thank you for understanding me.</font>

117
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:23,798
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

118
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,198
<font color="yellow">don't worry about my family business.</font>

119
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,698
<font color="yellow">It's nothing for you to worry about.</font>

120
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:30,498
<font color="yellow">Totally.</font>

121
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,368
<font color="yellow">- See you. - See you later.</font>

122
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:39,538
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my goodness. - Are you okay?</font>

123
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:21,868
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you okay?</font>

124
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,438
<font color="yellow">Do you have an upset stomach?</font>

125
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,738
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

126
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,668
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

127
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,768
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you Si Ho?</font>

128
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,298
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

129
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,498
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you in a while.</font>

130
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,208
<font color="yellow">When did you get back from Taereung?</font>

131
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,168
<font color="yellow">It's been a few days.</font>

132
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:46,568
<font color="yellow">Would it be impolite to welcome you back?</font>

133
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,498
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You can go back again.</font>

134
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,098
<font color="yellow">Many athletes haven't even made it to Taereung.</font>

135
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,138
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

136
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,238
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling okay? Shall I get you some medicine?</font>

137
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,798
<font color="yellow">No, I'm okay.</font>

138
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:01,708
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - Stop by the infirmary sometime.</font>

139
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:04,638
<font color="yellow">I'll massage your ankles. I know you had weak ankles.</font>

140
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:07,098
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

141
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:09,568
<font color="yellow">I have to get back to training.</font>

142
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:10,938
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

143
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,868
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thanks.</font>

144
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,798
<font color="yellow">How did she get an upset stomach? She doesn't even eat much.</font>

145
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:29,968
<font color="yellow">Will it be okay?</font>

146
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,238
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine. It isn't an expensive gift.</font>

147
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,768
<font color="yellow">You startled me, you punk.</font>

148
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:54,838
<font color="yellow">Most girls cringe when startled, but you get ready to punch.</font>

149
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,168
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

150
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,038
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, do you want my fist in your face?</font>

151
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:02,868
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

152
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,038
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how to take a joke?</font>

153
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,198
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

154
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,238

182
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:40,098

186
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:47,538
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

187
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,138
<font color="yellow">If her feelings about him are too obvious,</font>

188
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:52,498
<font color="yellow">he'll definitely take a step back.</font>

189
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,498

00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,098
<font color="yellow">but university students probably don't have time for that these days.</font>

306
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,408
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a little difficult.</font>

307
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:36,908
<font color="yellow">May I ask you what you're majoring in?</font>

308
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:38,838
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

309
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,768
<font color="yellow">My... My major?</font>

310
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,138
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

311
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:50,338
<font color="yellow">- Cello. - Cello?</font>

312
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:52,238
<font color="yellow">Cello?</font>

313
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,568
<font color="yellow">I see. You're a music student.</font>

314
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:58,838
<font color="yellow">I should have known.</font>

315
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:03,068
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I was a little surprised when I first saw you.</font>

316
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,638
<font color="yellow">It's not easy for a woman to carry something like that...</font>

317
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,698
<font color="yellow">unless she has strong arms, you know?</font>

318
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:12,468
<font color="yellow">You could probably do it because you're used to carrying a cello.</font>

319
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,498
<font color="yellow">- Aren't I right? - Well...</font>

320
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,298
<font color="yellow">Yes. I guess you can say that.</font>

321
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,338
<font color="yellow">I'd love to hear you playing your cello someday.</font>

322
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:25,908
<font color="yellow">As you can probably tell, I'm an avid fan of classical music.</font>

323
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:27,738
<font color="yellow">I go to recitals often, too.</font>

324
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,568
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm just an amateur compared to you.</font>

325
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,568
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

326
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:37,168
<font color="yellow">do all cellists...</font>

327
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:40,138
<font color="yellow">It's okay. You should answer it.</font>

328
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:42,938
<font color="yellow">I don't have to.</font>

329
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,408
<font color="yellow">Yes, Bok Joo. Where are you now?</font>

330
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,738
<font color="yellow">- Why do you ask? - What do you think?</font>

331
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,868
<font color="yellow">I'm going to your school now and want to bring you some chicken.</font>

332
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:58,038
<font color="yellow">- Are you at the dormitory? - No, I'm not.</font>

333
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,868
<font color="yellow">Then I'll leave it in your room. Share it with your friends. Bye.</font>

334
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:02,598
<font color="yellow">No, don't.</font>

335
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,568
<font color="yellow">Hello, hello?</font>

336
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:08,138
<font color="yellow">Sorry, something urgent has just come up.</font>

337
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,498
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to follow the diet.</font>

338
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:16,538
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

339
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:43,598
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Dad will find out everything if he meets them.</font>

340
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,408
<font color="yellow">- Hey, watch out! - Hey, stop.</font>

341
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,938
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

342
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,798
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can you get me to the dormitory? Please. Hurry up.</font>

343
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,398
<font color="yellow">Woman, this isn't a taxi.</font>

344
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:59,438
<font color="yellow">Look at that. What's that in your hair? Is it a dragonfly or what?</font>

345
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:00,568
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

346
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,398
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm in a rush. Please help me. Please?</font>

347
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,438
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on!</font>

348
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,238
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're such a nuisance.</font>

349
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,868
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm in a huge rush.</font>

350
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,298
<font color="yellow">- Just a second. - Hurry up.</font>

351
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,438
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Go, go.</font>

352
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,098
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - My gosh!</font>

353
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:21,938
<font color="yellow">Hurry up already.</font>

354
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:24,698
<font color="yellow">- Go faster. - Why are you hitting me?</font>

355
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:27,138
<font color="yellow">Hey, go faster!</font>

356
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,838
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, you're so heavy! - Hey!</font>

357
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,238
<font color="yellow">Go faster, please.</font>

358
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:41,398
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. Go faster. - You're really heavy.</font>

359
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,698
<font color="yellow">Chubs, you're making my life so difficult.</font>

360
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:46,938
<font color="yellow">Go faster, seriously!</font>

361
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:49,738
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

362
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,538
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're not even going to thank me?</font>

363
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:56,938
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

364
00:22:58,368 --> 00:22:59,798
<font color="yellow">Does she think that I'm her driver?</font>

365
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,238
<font color="yellow">The seat totally collapsed.</font>

366
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:07,598
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Dad, Dad!</font>

367
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:10,598
<font color="yellow">- Dad, Dad. - My goodness.</font>

368
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:15,538
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to run. I could've just left it with someone upstairs.</font>

369
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:18,538
<font color="yellow">This is an all-girls dormitory. No men are allowed here.</font>

370
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:20,038
<font color="yellow">Am I considered a man?</font>

371
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:23,098
<font color="yellow">I come here often for deliveries, so even the housemistress knows me.</font>

372
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:25,538
<font color="yellow">No one even stops me.</font>

373
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,498
<font color="yellow">All right. Just give it to me and go.</font>

374
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,898
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I'm a busy man, too.</font>

375
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,198
<font color="yellow">I won't stay even if you ask me to.</font>

376
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:33,698
<font color="yellow">Go. Get going already.</font>

377
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,468
<font color="yellow">Hey, it looks like all of your hard training is paying off.</font>

378
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:40,268
<font color="yellow">Your arms have gotten stronger. You could probably carry me.</font>

379
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,738
<font color="yellow">Why are you so chatty today?</font>

380
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:45,138
<font color="yellow">- Go and earn money, which you love. - Money?</font>

381
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,838
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right. I should go earn money. Enjoy the chicken.</font>

382
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,738
<font color="yellow">Overall, the test result shows...</font>

383
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,668
<font color="yellow">that your stress level is quite high.</font>

384
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,268
<font color="yellow">You're an athlete,</font>

385
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:10,398
<font color="yellow">so being in that kind of competitive environment must be stressful.</font>

386
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:14,238
<font color="yellow">By any chance, are there any specific symptoms...</font>

387
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,338
<font color="yellow">you experience on the day of a match?</font>

388
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:25,638
<font color="yellow">My heart beats so fast as if it's about to burst,</font>

389
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,998
<font color="yellow">and all sounds around me get muffled gradually.</font>

390
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:37,168
<font color="yellow">And eventually, I can't hear anything.</font>

391
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,768
<font color="yellow">It feels as if everything has been muted.</font>

392
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,368
<font color="yellow">You can't hear anything?</font>

393
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,298
<font color="yellow">Do you experience it only during matches?</font>

394
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:48,568
<font color="yellow">Usually. But it also happened during a few training sessions recently.</font>

395
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,898
<font color="yellow">I saw an ENT doctor and was told that my ears are fine.</font>

396
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,398
<font color="yellow">They must be fine. It's more psychological.</font>

397
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:59,998
<font color="yellow">Symptoms like that usually occur after a big shock...</font>

398
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,038
<font color="yellow">or a traumatic experience.</font>

399
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,098
<font color="yellow">It could be a type of panic disorder or conversion disorder.</font>

400
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:06,768
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

401
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,268
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

402
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,098
<font color="yellow">try to remember when you first experienced the symptoms.</font>

403
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:16,938
<font color="yellow">Did anything happen around that time to trigger such symptoms?</font>

404
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:24,668
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. Nothing specific is coming to my mind.</font>

405
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,368
<font color="yellow">From what I see,</font>

406
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,838
<font color="yellow">you're a highly defensive person.</font>

407
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,298
<font color="yellow">You don't like to expose your vulnerabilities,</font>

408
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,868
<font color="yellow">and you suppress everything.</font>

409
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,298
<font color="yellow">You probably don't want to see what's inside of you.</font>

410
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:43,268
<font color="yellow">No, I'm really not that complicated.</font>

411
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,438
<font color="yellow">See? You're in denial.</font>

412
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:46,938
<font color="yellow">Oh, boy. I'm in trouble.</font>

413
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:48,998
<font color="yellow">Patients like you are the most difficult ones to treat.</font>

414
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:51,698
<font color="yellow">Nevertheless,</font>

415
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:53,598
<font color="yellow">you must get it out of yourself.</font>

416
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,138
<font color="yellow">Only then, I'll be able to help you.</font>

417
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,398
<font color="yellow">On that note,</font>

418
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,198
<font color="yellow">I think we should get to know each other better.</font>

419
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:03,898
<font color="yellow">How about coffee?</font>

420
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:05,938
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

421
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:29,638
<font color="yellow">Try to remember when you first experienced the symptoms.</font>

422
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,338
<font color="yellow">Did anything happen around that time to trigger such symptoms?</font>

423
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:49,768
<font color="yellow">(I miss you, Joon Hyung. Merry Christmas! Love, Mom)</font>

424
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:13,468
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

425
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:14,768
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

426
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,538
<font color="yellow">- Did you come here because of me? - That's right.</font>

427
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:20,468
<font color="yellow">I came to make sure you take the counseling seriously.</font>

428
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:22,168
<font color="yellow">Come on. You're lying.</font>

429
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:26,068
<font color="yellow">I had a seminar nearby. I came to pick you up.</font>

430
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:30,038
<font color="yellow">You did come to keep an eye on me. Am I right?</font>

431
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,298
<font color="yellow">How is the counseling going?</font>

432
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:35,968
<font color="yellow">Fine. He seems like a good doctor.</font>

433
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:37,268
<font color="yellow">He sees right through me.</font>

434
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,698
<font color="yellow">I told you he's a famous doctor.</font>

435
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,898
<font color="yellow">I know. He's a great doctor.</font>

436
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,138
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.</font>

437
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,168
<font color="yellow">Where's your car?</font>

438
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:49,868
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

439
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:57,898
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

440
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:01,138
<font color="yellow">It's your umbrella I borrowed before.</font>

441
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:02,998
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

442
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,968
<font color="yellow">Why did you put it in a bag like this?</font>

443
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:09,038
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to.</font>

444
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:11,298
<font color="yellow">The person I lent it to put it in there.</font>

445
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:12,798
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

446
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:15,068
<font color="yellow">Is it a girl?</font>

447
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:16,568
<font color="yellow">It is a girl,</font>

448
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:19,298
<font color="yellow">but she's just my patient. She's a cellist.</font>

449
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:21,638
<font color="yellow">She goes to a music school?</font>

450
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,198
<font color="yellow">Of course. Men have...</font>

451
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,498
<font color="yellow">a fantasy towards girls who study music, right?</font>

452
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:30,038
<font color="yellow">Don't make things up.</font>

453
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,568
<font color="yellow">I don't fall for a patient.</font>

454
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:34,538
<font color="yellow">So tell me about her.</font>

00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:08,598
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Bok Joo?</font>

610
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:10,568
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

611
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:12,868
<font color="yellow">- What are you reading? - It's just a spam.</font>

612
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:14,538
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry. We'll be late for training.</font>

613
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,098
<font color="yellow">Look, there's Woon Gi.</font>

614
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:19,598
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. - I think he just came back.</font>

615
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,168
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's going on, but they'll be angry with him again.</font>

616
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:24,398
<font color="yellow">Let's keep quiet.</font>

617
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:26,638
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

618
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,398
<font color="yellow">I heard that in Goyang,</font>

619
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:31,038
<font color="yellow">they reached the quota already.</font>

620
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:34,038
<font color="yellow">- Aren't we hopeless, then? - What are you talking about?</font>

621
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:36,638
<font color="yellow">That isn't the only semi-professional team.</font>

622
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:38,098
<font color="yellow">Hey, Woon Gi!</font>

623
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:43,098
<font color="yellow">- Where have you been? - I'm sorry.</font>

624
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:45,738
<font color="yellow">Let me talk to Professor Yoon and Coach Choi first.</font>

625
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:48,368
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to ignore us?</font>

626
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,498
<font color="yellow">Do you have some good news?</font>

627
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:53,538
<font color="yellow">You seem to be in a good mood.</font>

628
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:55,268
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you have something to say,</font>

629
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:57,198
<font color="yellow">but let's talk later.</font>

630
00:37:57,198 --> 00:37:59,498
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's so annoying.</font>

631
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:02,838
<font color="yellow">As a captain, if you broke the rules to get off campus...</font>

632
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:04,598
<font color="yellow">and missed the morning training,</font>

633
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:07,338
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you at least give us some kind of explanation?</font>

634
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,638
<font color="yellow">We're your colleagues.</font>

635
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:10,168
<font color="yellow">Sang Chul is right.</font>

636
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:12,338
<font color="yellow">Do I have to report my personal issues?</font>

637
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,838
<font color="yellow">We were never close as colleagues.</font>

638
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:17,038
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to be petty and say this,</font>

639
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,868
<font color="yellow">but did you get an offer from a semi-professional team recently?</font>

640
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:22,238
<font color="yellow">Did you go visit one of them?</font>

641
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,938
<font color="yellow">- What is he talking about? - What did I expect?</font>

642
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:27,198
<font color="yellow">Why would an ace like yourself...</font>

643
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:29,198
<font color="yellow">care about what we weaklings think?</font>

644
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,638
<font color="yellow">Fine, just ignore us.</font>

645
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:33,038
<font color="yellow">You're such a traitor.</font>

646
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,338
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

647
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:37,868
<font color="yellow">- Wait, I... - Hey.</font>

648
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:40,268
<font color="yellow">We aren't done talking. Where do you think you're going?</font>

649
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,768
<font color="yellow">- I have to answer the phone. - Move out of the way.</font>

650
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,538
<font color="yellow">Is it a coach calling?</font>

651
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:46,638
<font color="yellow">- Give it back to me, you punk. - You want to start this?</font>

652
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,468
<font color="yellow">- Please don't do it. - Stop it.</font>

653
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,338
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you? - Why you...</font>

654
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:51,998
<font color="yellow">Have they lost their mind?</font>

655
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:54,868
<font color="yellow">- Come on, stop it. - Hey, what's going on?</font>

656
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:55,898
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

657
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,838
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

658
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:14,198
<font color="yellow">Hold it correctly. Lower your bottoms.</font>

659
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,698
<font color="yellow">It's additional 10 minutes each time someone falls.</font>

660
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:17,768
<font color="yellow">You've lost your mind.</font>

661
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:21,468
<font color="yellow">Do you think I worked hard to train you...</font>

662
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:24,368
<font color="yellow">so that you can get into fights? You punks.</font>

663
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:26,198
<font color="yellow">You need to grow up first.</font>

664
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:27,998
<font color="yellow">Hold it!</font>

665
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,338
<font color="yellow">If you can't even hold it for this long,</font>

666
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:34,308
<font color="yellow">you'd better quit weightlifting. My goodness.</font>

667
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,338
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi, they should be trained much harder...</font>

668
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,638
<font color="yellow">so that they're too exhausted...</font>

669
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,538
<font color="yellow">to not get into this kind of nonsense.</font>

670
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:44,338
<font color="yellow">When I went to Atlanta to train for the Olympics,</font>

671
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,938
<font color="yellow">something like this could never happen. You know why?</font>

672
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,868
<font color="yellow">We were too exhausted from training to get into any kind of fight.</font>

673
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:53,138
<font color="yellow">They should just be busy with their training. I'm so disappointed.</font>

674
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:55,998
<font color="yellow">He's giving me a headache.</font>

675
00:39:57,538 --> 00:39:59,768
<font color="yellow">Don't you see what's going on?</font>

676
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:01,238
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon is very upset.</font>

677
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,098
<font color="yellow">- Keep up the good work. - We can do it.</font>

678
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,168
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

679
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:11,268
<font color="yellow">Good job, everyone.</font>

680
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:28,398
<font color="yellow">Everyone, get up.</font>

681
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,898
<font color="yellow">Do some stretching and come outside.</font>

682
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:42,938
<font color="yellow">(15 minutes before the appointment)</font>

683
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,238
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sitting down?</font>

684
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,338
<font color="yellow">You need some meat after wasting your energy.</font>

685
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:03,968
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? The seniors should barbecue the meat.</font>

686
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,098
<font color="yellow">The rest of you can set the table and take a seat.</font>

687
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:08,338
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Coach. - Yes, Coach.</font>

688
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:10,998
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go.</font>

689
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:14,938
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

690
00:41:16,338 --> 00:41:17,338
<font color="yellow">I have diabetes.</font>

691
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:20,568
<font color="yellow">My doctor told me not to eat meat.</font>

692
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:23,308
<font color="yellow">However, I still eat it.</font>

693
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:27,568
<font color="yellow">I can be healthier by giving up meat,</font>

694
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,438
<font color="yellow">but I'd rather eat what I enjoy.</font>

695
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:34,668
<font color="yellow">I'd rather live a happier life than a healthy one. That's my belief.</font>

696
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,138
<font color="yellow">I hope that...</font>

697
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,198
<font color="yellow">you'll live that way, too.</font>

698
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,898
<font color="yellow">Instead of being happy for making it to the national team and winning,</font>

699
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,538
<font color="yellow">I hope that weightlifting makes you happy.</font>

700
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:52,738
<font color="yellow">Some coaches might laugh...</font>

701
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:54,938
<font color="yellow">at what I just said.</font>

702
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:57,138
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

703
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:00,238
<font color="yellow">I don't want you...</font>

704
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:04,198
<font color="yellow">to give up weightlifting because you damaged your body too much...</font>

705
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,768
<font color="yellow">just to win a gold medal.</font>

706
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:10,308
<font color="yellow">If your goal is to win a medal,</font>

707
00:42:10,938 --> 00:42:12,468
<font color="yellow">and if you don't, you'd be unhappy.</font>

708
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,098
<font color="yellow">However, if you simply love...</font>

709
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,398
<font color="yellow">lifting that cold, heavy metal,</font>

710
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,638
<font color="yellow">wouldn't you be happy by simply lifting weights?</font>

711
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:26,938
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

712
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:29,238
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

713
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,938
<font color="yellow">I know all of you are having a hard time...</font>

714
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:38,268
<font color="yellow">these days,</font>

715
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:39,808
<font color="yellow">especially the seniors.</font>

716
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:42,338
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're worried.</font>

717
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:44,338
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

718
00:42:45,468 --> 00:42:47,598
<font color="yellow">you have to wait until the end of the game for the results.</font>

719
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,438
<font color="yellow">Just like that,</font>

720
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:51,968
<font color="yellow">you have no idea how your life will turn out.</font>

721
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,338
<font color="yellow">During the last half of a soccer game,</font>

722
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,998
<font color="yellow">you might turn off the TV thinking that the team already lost.</font>

723
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,938
<font color="yellow">Right then, the team makes a goal.</font>

724
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,998
<font color="yellow">You must watch it until the end.</font>

725
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:05,638
<font color="yellow">If you do that, you'll win.</font>

726
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:18,198
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't seem to stop talking today.</font>

727
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,438
<font color="yellow">Meanwhile, the meat is getting burnt.</font>

728
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,538
<font color="yellow">That's all I have to say. Let's eat!</font>

729
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:30,568
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.</font>

730
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:32,168
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Thank you.</font>

731
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,808
<font color="yellow">- Set up the table. - Here you go.</font>

732
00:43:34,368 --> 00:43:35,968
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - I'll do it.</font>

733
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:39,698
<font color="yellow">(10 minutes before the appointment)</font>

734
00:43:41,498 --> 00:43:42,538
<font color="yellow">It reeks of meat.</font>

735
00:43:42,768 --> 00:43:45,338
<font color="yellow">Order more meat if we need more.</font>

736
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:46,838
<font color="yellow">I talked to Mr. Jung about it.</font>

737
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:49,338
<font color="yellow">- Is it out of your own pocket? - Watch it.</font>

738
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:53,138
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for getting out of line.</font>

739
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,468
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon, Coach Choi.</font>

740
00:43:56,838 --> 00:43:58,868
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I have to step out for a while.</font>

741
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:02,568
<font color="yellow">I was going to talk to you in private. What's going on?</font>

742
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:04,898
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - You can go.</font>

743
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,968
<font color="yellow">Will you be back before the roll call?</font>

744
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:08,198
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

745
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:11,198
<font color="yellow">- Is everything okay? - Yes, it's fine.</font>

746
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:12,238
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

747
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:14,168
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

748
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:17,338
<font color="yellow">- But... - Coach Choi.</font>

749
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:20,838
<font color="yellow">Trusting them is a way to support them.</font>

750
00:44:32,398 --> 00:44:34,038
<font color="yellow">This is Bok Joo, and I have an appointment at 7pm.</font>

751
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,138
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'm running a little late.</font>

752
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,138
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm on my way.</font>

753
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:41,738
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there. See you soon.</font>

754
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,038
<font color="yellow">My goodness, it's raining.</font>

755
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:52,838
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

756
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:55,098
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

757
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:29,298
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to keep you at work.</font>

758
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:30,868
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm usually here at this hour.</font>

759
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:33,668
<font color="yellow">Did you get wet again?</font>

760
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:38,198
<font color="yellow">It must look obvious. Does it look bad?</font>

761
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:39,338
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

762
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:41,668
<font color="yellow">You should stay out of the rain.</font>

763
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:43,538
<font color="yellow">You'll catch a cold.</font>

764
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:46,838
<font color="yellow">You must be in good condition to take good care of yourself.</font>

765
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:51,668
<font color="yellow">I'll do that, Doctor.</font>

766
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:54,998
<font color="yellow">You did a great job.</font>

767
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:57,738
<font color="yellow">Without any muscle loss, you've lost 200g of body fat.</font>

768
00:45:58,568 --> 00:45:59,738
<font color="yellow">Did you stick to a good diet?</font>

769
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:01,398
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

770
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:04,038
<font color="yellow">I don't think I kept it very strictly.</font>

771
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:07,568
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you the truth. Why wouldn't you believe me?</font>

772
00:46:08,938 --> 00:46:09,938
<font color="yellow">Take a look.</font>

773
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,968
<font color="yellow">This is your body mass index graph.</font>

774
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:17,998
<font color="yellow">This is your body fat, and...</font>

775
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:52,398
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo?</font>

776
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:54,568
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

777
00:46:55,068 --> 00:46:56,668
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Of course.</font>

778
00:46:57,598 --> 00:46:58,598
<font color="yellow">- What was I saying? - Pardon me?</font>

779
00:46:58,598 --> 00:46:59,638
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

780
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:05,198
<font color="yellow">I was going to reward you, but you blew your chance.</font>

781
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:09,568
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't thinking about something else.</font>

782
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,098
<font color="yellow">I was just too immersed in the music.</font>

783
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:16,068
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. That...</font>

784
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:18,138
<font color="yellow">"J.B. Breval Sonata".</font>

785
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:20,038
<font color="yellow">I heard that it's like "Czerny New Studies"...</font>

786
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:21,868
<font color="yellow">to cellists.</font>

787
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:25,668
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

788
00:47:25,768 --> 00:47:29,368
<font color="yellow">Breval... I heard it so many times that I almost know it by heart.</font>

789
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,198
<font color="yellow">It's such a long etude, though.</font>

790
00:47:33,638 --> 00:47:34,798
<font color="yellow">How long do you have to practice...</font>

791
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:36,738
<font color="yellow">in order to master it and play it like you?</font>

792
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,268
<font color="yellow">It depends on the person.</font>

793
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:44,998
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

794
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:48,868
<font color="yellow">- about 3... - For 3 months?</font>

795
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:49,968
<font color="yellow">From 3 months to 4, 5 or 6 years?</font>

796
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,338
<font color="yellow">When it comes to cello, the difference can be big.</font>

797
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,398
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

798
00:47:57,838 --> 00:47:58,838
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

799
00:47:59,538 --> 00:48:00,598
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

800
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,438
<font color="yellow">shall we start the treatment?</font>

801
00:48:02,938 --> 00:48:03,998
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

802
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,338
<font color="yellow">- This way, please. - Okay.</font>

803
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:29,698
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

804
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:33,298
<font color="yellow">We could've gotten more if it didn't start pouring.</font>

805
00:48:33,298 --> 00:48:35,698
<font color="yellow">I know. Why did it start raining all of a sudden?</font>

806
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:38,768
<font color="yellow">Hey, where is Bok Joo by the way? She didn't say where she was going.</font>

807
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:41,398
<font color="yellow">I guess she's doing deliveries.</font>

808
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:43,968
<font color="yellow">That girl is so busy.</font>

809
00:48:45,168 --> 00:48:48,298
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that we should try to be better friends to her?</font>

810
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:52,598
<font color="yellow">We've had so much fried chicken at her dad's restaurant, you know.</font>

811
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:54,198
<font color="yellow">I guess you're right.</font>

812
00:48:54,538 --> 00:48:57,468
<font color="yellow">Shall we go help them serve their customers?</font>

813
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:01,268
<font color="yellow">- Best friends! - Best friends!</font>

814
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:09,568
<font color="yellow">We're seriously so slow today.</font>

815
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:13,298
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you so quiet these days?</font>

816
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:15,598
<font color="yellow">Your boss hasn't called you?</font>

817
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:18,668
<font color="yellow">I made a scene and asked for money. Would you call me if you were him?</font>

818
00:49:21,298 --> 00:49:24,138
<font color="yellow">By the way, why does Bok Joo never come by these days?</font>

819
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,398
<font color="yellow">I told her to focus on training.</font>

820
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,068
<font color="yellow">She has to start preparing for the upcoming tournament soon.</font>

821
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,138
<font color="yellow">I actually miss her now that I haven't seen her for a while.</font>

822
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,568
<font color="yellow">My troublemaker niece.</font>

823
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:39,168
<font color="yellow">Gosh, hold on. I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

824
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:42,898
<font color="yellow">That little... How dare he call her a troublemaker!</font>

825
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:44,438
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

826
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:45,838
<font color="yellow">- Hello! - My gosh!</font>

827
00:49:46,298 --> 00:49:48,538
<font color="yellow">Look who's here. I haven't seen you girls in a while.</font>

828
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:49,938
<font color="yellow">Where is Bok Joo?</font>

829
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:51,338
<font color="yellow">She's not here?</font>

830
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:53,698
<font color="yellow">Why would she be here at this hour? Is she not at school?</font>

831
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:56,298
<font color="yellow">- I thought... - I just remembered...</font>

832
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:59,538
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo told me that she was going to a sauna. I totally forgot.</font>

833
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,168
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so forgetful these days.</font>

834
00:50:02,038 --> 00:50:03,198
<font color="yellow">Take care, Mr. Kim.</font>

835
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:05,498
<font color="yellow">- Take care. - Bye, girls.</font>

836
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:11,098
<font color="yellow">Hey, what was that about?</font>

837
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:12,698
<font color="yellow">Where did she go, then?</font>

838
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:14,998
<font color="yellow">Who knows? Gosh, I can't believe this.</font>

839
00:50:14,998 --> 00:50:17,068
<font color="yellow">That sly fox.</font>

840
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:19,068
<font color="yellow">We've been completely fooled.</font>

841
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:21,568
<font color="yellow">Kim Bok Joo, I shall teach you a lesson.</font>

842
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:49,738
<font color="yellow">Hey, girls. Why are you here?</font>

843
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:50,898
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere?</font>

844
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,098
<font color="yellow">No, we've been waiting for you.</font>

845
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:55,438
<font color="yellow">You're late. Where have you been?</font>

846
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:58,338
<font color="yellow">What do you think? I was out doing deliveries.</font>

847
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:02,098
<font color="yellow">We were so busy. Orders kept coming in nonstop.</font>

848
00:51:02,098 --> 00:51:03,668
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare lie to our faces.</font>

849
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:05,838
<font color="yellow">We were just at Bok Chicken.</font>

850
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:07,068
<font color="yellow">There wasn't a single soul there,</font>

851
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:08,598
<font color="yellow">and your dad thought you were here.</font>

852
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,738
<font color="yellow">You better tell us the truth.</font>

853
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:14,838
<font color="yellow">What's keeping you so busy these days?</font>

854
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:16,868
<font color="yellow">Where on earth were you?</font>

855
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:18,668
<font color="yellow">You better tell us. Don't even think about lying.</font>

856
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:22,098
<font color="yellow">Actually, I was...</font>

857
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:24,038
<font color="yellow">- Go on. - What is it?</font>

858
00:51:25,598 --> 00:51:26,838
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

859
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:37,338
<font color="yellow">I kept it from you guys because I was too embarrassed to tell you.</font>

860
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:39,668
<font color="yellow">We're best friends. Why would you feel embarrassed...</font>

861
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:47,098
<font color="yellow">Is it that thing again?</font>

862
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:49,638
<font color="yellow">Did you go to see a doctor because of it?</font>

863
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:51,338
<font color="yellow">Is that really what's happening?</font>

864
00:51:51,768 --> 00:51:54,168
<font color="yellow">You should've just told us. It's nothing to be embarrassed about.</font>

865
00:51:57,168 --> 00:51:58,438
<font color="yellow">I know, but...</font>

866
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,198
<font color="yellow">What did the doctor say? Is it really bad?</font>

867
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:05,398
<font color="yellow">Do you need surgery?</font>

868
00:52:05,898 --> 00:52:07,798
<font color="yellow">No, it's not that serious.</font>

869
00:52:08,768 --> 00:52:09,768
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

870
00:52:10,138 --> 00:52:12,038
<font color="yellow">You should still be careful from now on.</font>

871
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:14,398
<font color="yellow">- You have to watch what you eat. - Yes, I should.</font>

872
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:19,238
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to worry my dad, you know.</font>

873
00:52:19,498 --> 00:52:22,268
<font color="yellow">It's probably going to get better soon, so I didn't tell you.</font>

874
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,298
<font color="yellow">Still, you should've told us.</font>

875
00:52:24,598 --> 00:52:26,138
<font color="yellow">We were so worried about you.</font>

876
00:52:26,138 --> 00:52:29,898
<font color="yellow">Yes. We'll get mad at you if you keep another secret from us.</font>

877
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:32,398
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm sorry.</font>

878
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:36,938
<font color="yellow">- Be careful, okay? - Did you get medication for it?</font>

879
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:45,238
<font color="yellow">I guess lying also requires practice.</font>

880
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:46,698
<font color="yellow">The more you lie, the better you get.</font>

881
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:59,098
<font color="yellow">"Bach Cello Suite Number One".</font>

882
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:01,598
<font color="yellow">Pre... Pre...</font>

883
00:53:02,198 --> 00:53:03,438
<font color="yellow">How do I pronounce this word?</font>

884
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:11,468
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't turn it off.</font>

885
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,498
<font color="yellow">I guess you like classical music, too.</font>

886
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:16,468
<font color="yellow">Well, yes. A little.</font>

887
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:19,268
<font color="yellow">About Joon Hyung...</font>

888
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:21,068
<font color="yellow">Isn't he charming?</font>

889
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,538
<font color="yellow">He makes you laugh.</font>

890
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:25,868
<font color="yellow">He comes across as aloof, but he's actually very caring.</font>

891
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:29,398
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure about that. I haven't noticed that about him.</font>

892
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:33,668
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I want to get back together with him,</font>

893
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,838
<font color="yellow">but he's not opening up to me.</font>

894
00:53:36,138 --> 00:53:37,438
<font color="yellow">I broke his heart in the past.</font>

895
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,938
<font color="yellow">Will you be able to help me if I ever need your help?</font>

896
00:53:43,998 --> 00:53:45,238
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

897
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:48,668
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure how I can help you, though.</font>

898
00:53:49,598 --> 00:53:50,598
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

899
00:53:51,038 --> 00:53:52,868
<font color="yellow">You and Joon Hyung seem very close.</font>

900
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:55,368
<font color="yellow">Gosh, no way. We're not close at all.</font>

901
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,438
<font color="yellow">All right, I heard you.</font>

902
00:54:08,768 --> 00:54:10,398
<font color="yellow">I bluffed in front of our students,</font>

903
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:12,668
<font color="yellow">but I'm very worried these days.</font>

904
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,238
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that they might get no offers and become unemployed.</font>

905
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:21,268
<font color="yellow">I hear you. We should start to receive some offers by now.</font>

906
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,168
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because our team's performance wasn't great last year.</font>

907
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:28,798
<font color="yellow">We only have the tournament and a couple of matches left.</font>

908
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:30,598
<font color="yellow">They must be frustrated, too.</font>

909
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:33,938
<font color="yellow">I mean, their lives depend on this.</font>

910
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:38,068
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon, on that note...</font>

911
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,468
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about it and...</font>

912
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:52,138
<font color="yellow">You'll be discharged tomorrow, right?</font>

913
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:55,198
<font color="yellow">You can't even go to a postnatal care center.</font>

914
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:56,938
<font color="yellow">Doing everything alone will be hard.</font>

915
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,168
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

916
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:00,268
<font color="yellow">We can't afford things like that.</font>

917
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,868
<font color="yellow">I can do it alone. I already bought seaweed, too.</font>

918
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:12,568
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

919
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:14,438
<font color="yellow">Yes, Professor Yoon.</font>

920
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:18,498
<font color="yellow">My weight class?</font>

921
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:19,598
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

922
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:23,098
<font color="yellow">Well, it's Coach Choi's idea.</font>

923
00:55:24,098 --> 00:55:25,538
<font color="yellow">We know...</font>

924
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:28,598
<font color="yellow">that gaining weight and muscle mass isn't an easy thing to do.</font>

925
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:33,268
<font color="yellow">But if we do it, winning a medal will become easier for you.</font>

926
00:55:34,138 --> 00:55:37,698
<font color="yellow">And Jung Woo will be able to aim for a medal, too.</font>

927
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:41,068
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

928
00:55:41,168 --> 00:55:43,798
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure. Give it some thought.</font>

929
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:45,668
<font color="yellow">We can talk about it again later.</font>

930
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:47,038
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

931
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:50,538
<font color="yellow">One more thing, Professor Yoon.</font>

932
00:55:51,298 --> 00:55:52,538
<font color="yellow">Let's call one more person.</font>

933
00:55:53,368 --> 00:55:54,368
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

934
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:00,668
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

935
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,438
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo's weight class? - Yes.</font>

936
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:50,138
<font color="yellow">I've given it a lot of thoughts.</font>

937
00:56:50,938 --> 00:56:51,998
<font color="yellow">It's possible.</font>

938
00:56:52,468 --> 00:56:54,838
<font color="yellow">In women's 63kg, no one can beat Bok Joo.</font>

939
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:56,268
<font color="yellow">She will own it.</font>

940
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,098
<font color="yellow">If Bok Joo raises her weight class,</font>

941
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:00,668
<font color="yellow">she will be more likely to win a medal.</font>

942
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:02,638
<font color="yellow">Girls in 58kg will have...</font>

943
00:57:03,198 --> 00:57:05,438
<font color="yellow">a better hope for a medal as well.</font>

944
00:57:05,438 --> 00:57:07,168
<font color="yellow">It can be a win-win situation.</font>

945
00:57:07,368 --> 00:57:10,468
<font color="yellow">The remaining competition, especially for the seniors,</font>

946
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,098
<font color="yellow">is so important...</font>

947
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:14,098
<font color="yellow">for their career.</font>

948
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,838
<font color="yellow">In fact, a senior named Woon Gi...</font>

949
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,138
<font color="yellow">is considering a weight increase as well.</font>

950
00:57:20,138 --> 00:57:21,868
<font color="yellow">I get what you're saying,</font>

951
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:23,868
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

952
00:57:24,568 --> 00:57:27,138
<font color="yellow">raising weight is even harder than lowering it.</font>

953
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:37,068
<font color="yellow">(Weight on November 23rd: 57.12kg, Weight on November 24th: 56.80kg)</font>

954
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:39,098
<font color="yellow">You lost 300g again.</font>

955
00:57:39,898 --> 00:57:41,768
<font color="yellow">I really should give you a prize.</font>

956
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:43,468
<font color="yellow">You're doing great.</font>

957
00:57:44,138 --> 00:57:45,168
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

958
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:48,168
<font color="yellow">What will you give me?</font>

959
00:57:49,168 --> 00:57:50,738
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. What would be good?</font>

960
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,038
<font color="yellow">It should be something you want.</font>

961
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,238
<font color="yellow">Give it some thoughts. Please go and change.</font>

962
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:01,138
<font color="yellow">Okay, Doctor.</font>

963
00:58:15,998 --> 00:58:17,168
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Chubs?</font>

964
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:34,238
<font color="yellow">What... What are you wearing?</font>

965
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:36,998
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Joon Hyung.</font>

966
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:40,238
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

967
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:41,938
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jae Yi.</font>

968
00:58:42,338 --> 00:58:43,398
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

969
00:58:47,268 --> 00:58:49,238
<font color="yellow">- Do you two know each other? - Yes.</font>

970
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:50,868
<font color="yellow">She and I go to...</font>

<font color="yellow">The cellist I told you about is Bok Joo.</font>

973
00:59:09,198 --> 00:59:11,838
<font color="yellow">You have arms of an athlete.</font>

974
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:13,798
<font color="yellow">She likes soccer. Messi, in particular.</font>

975
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:15,498
<font color="yellow">Chubs. I want this. Get me water, too.</font>

976
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:17,668
<font color="yellow">- What happened with Joon Hyung? - Let's talk.</font>

977
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:19,598
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for liking your brother.</font>

978
00:59:19,698 --> 00:59:21,468
<font color="yellow">Do you like my brother that much?</font>

979
00:59:21,468 --> 00:59:23,398
