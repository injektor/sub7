00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,556
<font color="yellow">Chubs, what are you doing here?</font>

2
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:44,456
<font color="yellow">Why do you...</font>

3
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:45,656
<font color="yellow">look like that?</font>

4
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,496
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Joon Hyung.</font>

5
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,626
<font color="yellow">What brings you here without calling me?</font>

6
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,426
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jae Yi.</font>

7
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:56,126
<font color="yellow">- Jae Yi? - I was just in the neighborhood.</font>

8
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,796
<font color="yellow">I stopped by to eat with you.</font>

9
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:02,656
<font color="yellow">Do you know each other?</font>

10
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:06,196
<font color="yellow">- We went to the same... - Elementary school.</font>

11
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,266
<font color="yellow">We attended the same elementary school.</font>

12
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:13,026
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, I haven't seen you in so long.</font>

13
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,096
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that we met again.</font>

14
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,656
<font color="yellow">We haven't seen each other for 10 years, right?</font>

15
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,266
<font color="yellow">You still recognized me.</font>

16
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,126
<font color="yellow">It's a small world after all.</font>

17
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,196
<font color="yellow">She's the cellist...</font>

18
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,456
<font color="yellow">I mentioned to you before.</font>

19
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,256
<font color="yellow">That was Bok Joo.</font>

20
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:33,896
<font color="yellow">A cellist?</font>

21
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,496
<font color="yellow">She's a cellist?</font>

22
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:44,326
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

23
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,356
<font color="yellow">Your major is playing the cello?</font>

24
00:01:57,596 --> 00:02:00,226
<font color="yellow">You were gifted in music since elementary school.</font>

25
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:02,456
<font color="yellow">She's also a great singer.</font>

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,756
<font color="yellow">She is?</font>

27
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:05,526
<font color="yellow">Am I?</font>

28
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,996
<font color="yellow">You must have been very close to remember such details.</font>

29
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:12,196
<font color="yellow">Of course, we were best friends.</font>

30
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,756
<font color="yellow">It's great to see you again, Bok Joo.</font>

31
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:15,826
<font color="yellow">We'll have a great time together.</font>

32
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,826
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think? - Right.</font>

33
00:02:19,526 --> 00:02:20,926
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you again.</font>

34
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,596
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that you met each other again.</font>

35
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,826
<font color="yellow">There must be a strong connection between us, Bok Joo.</font>

36
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,326
<font color="yellow">You went to the same elementary school with my brother.</font>

37
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,826
<font color="yellow">How do you play the cello so well?</font>

38
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:34,396
<font color="yellow">She's also very strong.</font>

39
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:35,696
<font color="yellow">A cellist is...</font>

40
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,956
<font color="yellow">- as strong as a weightlifter. - I like classical music, too.</font>

41
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,326
<font color="yellow">This must be a dream.</font>

42
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:55,926
<font color="yellow">Such a thing can't be possible.</font>

43
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,196
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

44
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,326
<font color="yellow">They don't even take after one another.</font>

45
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:02,796
<font color="yellow">This is so absurd!</font>

46
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:04,226
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

47
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,026
<font color="yellow">Cellist Kim Bok Joo.</font>

48
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,056
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

49
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,226
<font color="yellow">I think we're going to the same destination.</font>

50

<font color="yellow">(Episode 5, I'm Happy Because I'm a Woman)</font>

51
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:28,396
<font color="yellow">You're a cellist?</font>

52
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,226
<font color="yellow">After all, your arms are more fit for being a cellist...</font>

53
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,556
<font color="yellow">than a violin or a flute player.</font>

54
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:37,326
<font color="yellow">You understand exactly what the best thing is for you.</font>

55
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:40,426
<font color="yellow">Stop acting like a know-it-all.</font>

56
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,356
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you upset with me?</font>

57
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:49,426
<font color="yellow">Are you calling me a know-it-all when I covered up for you?</font>

58
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,026
<font color="yellow">How could you call me that?</font>

59
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:54,126
<font color="yellow">Is he really your brother?</font>

60
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,556
<font color="yellow">Of course we're brothers.</font>

61
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:00,426
<font color="yellow">Since when have you been going there?</font>

62
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,156
<font color="yellow">If you went there simply to lose weight,</font>

63
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:06,556
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't lie about being a cellist.</font>

64
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:10,126
<font color="yellow">It means that you had an ulterior motive.</font>

65
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:18,966
<font color="yellow">Have you...</font>

66
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,756
<font color="yellow">fallen in love with my brother?</font>

67
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,056
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you go there?</font>

68
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,096
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

69
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,156
<font color="yellow">You're so creative, aren't you?</font>

70
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,596
<font color="yellow">Even if I fell in love with him,</font>

71
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,596
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't go there by paying so much money.</font>

72
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:35,256
<font color="yellow">Then why do you go there by paying so much money?</font>

73
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,966
<font color="yellow">Weightlifter Bok Joo?</font>

74
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:42,256
<font color="yellow">That's because... Gosh, there's a mayfly.</font>

75
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,396
<font color="yellow">You've matured a lot, Chubs.</font>

76
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,356
<font color="yellow">You're willing to go far for a man.</font>

77
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,556
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you be in trouble if other weightlifters find out?</font>

78
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,796
<font color="yellow">A weightlifter falls in love...</font>

79
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,226
<font color="yellow">with a doctor at a weight clinic.</font>

80
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:58,096
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

81
00:04:58,796 --> 00:04:59,796
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

82
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,966
<font color="yellow">You'll keep it a secret, won't you?</font>

83
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,126
<font color="yellow">Of course I will.</font>

84
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,556
<font color="yellow">Announcing it won't do me any good.</font>

85
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:16,796
<font color="yellow">You thought I'd keep quiet?</font>

86
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:21,156
<font color="yellow">It's unnecessary for me to keep it a secret.</font>

87
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:23,826
<font color="yellow">I'll decide...</font>

88
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,696
<font color="yellow">depending on how you behave.</font>

89
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:30,056
<font color="yellow">Come on, what do you mean by that?</font>

90
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,126
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

91
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:34,556
<font color="yellow">Are you getting angry at me?</font>

92
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,556
<font color="yellow">No, I just have a loud voice.</font>

93
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,996
<font color="yellow">Maybe that's why I sounded angry.</font>

94
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,156
<font color="yellow">No, I think you're angry at me.</font>

95
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:45,396
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not.</font>

96
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,226
<font color="yellow">I'm getting upset.</font>

97
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,156
<font color="yellow">I'm not angry at you.</font>

98
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,296
<font color="yellow">I'm really not.</font>

99
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,026
<font color="yellow">Let me think about it.</font>

100
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:56,196
<font color="yellow">Think about what? I'm not angry.</font>

101
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:58,426
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

102
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:01,796
<font color="yellow">I'm not angry at you. Come on.</font>

103
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,956
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sorry!</font>

104
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,996
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

105
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,696
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

106
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:19,056
<font color="yellow">Why did she fall in love with my brother of all people?</font>

107
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:20,996
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

108
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:26,556
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

109
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,426
<font color="yellow">Why is he the brother of Joon Hyung?</font>

110
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,096
<font color="yellow">Awesome, it's fish cutlet.</font>

111
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,296
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Hey.</font>

112
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:48,896
<font color="yellow">Be careful when you sit.</font>

113
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:50,626
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

114
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,926
<font color="yellow">No, you're not. You should be careful.</font>

115
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,526
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't she carry a cushion with her?</font>

116
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:57,726
<font color="yellow">That would make it too obvious.</font>

117
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:00,556
<font color="yellow">Okay, you're exempted from eating a lot...</font>

118
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,626
<font color="yellow">for a while.</font>

119
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,756
<font color="yellow">- Our friendship is awesome. - Awesome.</font>

120
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:05,756
<font color="yellow">Awesome.</font>

121
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,696
<font color="yellow">It's very good to see you.</font>

122
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:21,326
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well last night?</font>

123
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,056
<font color="yellow">I'm done. See you later.</font>

124
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,826
<font color="yellow">No way. You just started eating.</font>

125
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,256
<font color="yellow">Come on, we're colleagues. Why are you acting like this?</font>

126
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:31,556
<font color="yellow">Sit back down.</font>

127
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:33,896
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Take a seat.</font>

128
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:37,596
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're strangers. Come and sit down.</font>

129
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:40,196
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me.</font>

130
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:54,896
<font color="yellow">Why do my hands feel weak today?</font>

131
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,326
<font color="yellow">Chubs, do it for me.</font>

132
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:01,796
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

133
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:03,956
<font color="yellow">Cut it for me.</font>

134
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,696
<font color="yellow">Don't make it too thin.</font>

135
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,696
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can you get me some water, too?</font>

136
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,156
<font color="yellow">Make it half cold and half hot.</font>

137
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,326
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, why can't you do it yourself?</font>

138
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:44,956
<font color="yellow">- I'll get it for you. - It's okay.</font>

139
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:47,326
<font color="yellow">I'll get it.</font>

140
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,156
<font color="yellow">I was thirsty myself anyway.</font>

141
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,356
<font color="yellow">Make it 6 to 4 ratio.</font>

142
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:15,456
<font color="yellow">It's sweet.</font>

143
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,726
<font color="yellow">The water tastes especially sweet today.</font>

144
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,896
<font color="yellow">What's going on between you and Joon Hyung?</font>

145
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:30,596
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

146
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,626
<font color="yellow">Then why are you being obedient to him?</font>

147
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:34,996
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hate him?</font>

148
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:38,326
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't get water even for us. Something is definitely strange.</font>

149
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,656
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

150
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,826
<font color="yellow">It wasn't such a big deal.</font>

151
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:47,496
<font color="yellow">I realized that he isn't a bad person after all.</font>

152
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:49,296
<font color="yellow">He's a bit immature,</font>

153
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,826
<font color="yellow">but I must overlook him because we're colleagues.</font>

154
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,926
<font color="yellow">You should have overlooked him a long time ago.</font>

155
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,066
<font color="yellow">What made you change your mind...</font>

156
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,956
<font color="yellow">- so suddenly? - I know.</font>

157
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,256
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that there's nothing between you two?</font>

158
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,256
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

159
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,256
<font color="yellow">It's not because I like him...</font>

160
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,226
<font color="yellow">or because he knows some secret about me.</font>

161
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,926
<font color="yellow">You guys are too sensitive.</font>

162
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:15,096
<font color="yellow">My beautiful skin will be damaged again the day after tomorrow.</font>

163
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,426
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I'd call your skin beautiful,</font>

164
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:18,826
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to compete, either.</font>

165
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,696
<font color="yellow">A competition is still necessary.</font>

166
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,326
<font color="yellow">This is the only event that makes us proud.</font>

167
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,396
<font color="yellow">That's true. If we win, we'll get a big dinner, right?</font>

168
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:30,256
<font color="yellow">- Yes. Of course. - Well...</font>

169
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,196
<font color="yellow">Guys. I should take off. I need to go to the hospital.</font>

170
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:35,226
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

171
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,826
<font color="yellow">If anyone asks about you, we'll make up a story.</font>

172
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,496
<font color="yellow">I should get going. Thank you, guys.</font>

173
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:41,566
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

174
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:44,566
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

175
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,956
<font color="yellow">She seems so uncomfortable.</font>

176
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:50,296
<font color="yellow">- It's hard to watch. - Is it?</font>

177
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:09,026
<font color="yellow">It's 21.27 seconds. You stick out your head too much. Keep it down.</font>

178
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:11,756
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

179
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,226
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - I'm tired.</font>

180
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:17,196
<font color="yellow">Now, go. That's right. Keep going.</font>

181
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,496
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good.</font>

182
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:29,026
<font color="yellow">If I go to the dormitory, Ki Seok would know.</font>

183
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,456
<font color="yellow">Chubs...</font>

184
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,096
<font color="yellow">I can see where she's headed to.</font>

185
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:45,196
<font color="yellow">Okay. Kim Bok Joo. I choose you.</font>

186
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:53,726
<font color="yellow">You're maintaining your weight, but it's not decreasing.</font>

187
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,696
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to lose weight in a healthy way, right?</font>

188
00:11:57,696 --> 00:11:58,756
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

189
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,226
<font color="yellow">But I often do sit-ups.</font>

190
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,696
<font color="yellow">You're doing good.</font>

191
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,056
<font color="yellow">Let's not get ahead of ourselves and be greedy.</font>

192
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:10,896
<font color="yellow">By the way, I guess you haven't changed since you were little.</font>

193
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:14,096
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - Joon Hyung recognized you at once.</font>

194
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:18,156
<font color="yellow">- He has changed a lot, right? - Yes.</font>

195
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,126
<font color="yellow">I didn't recognize him at first.</font>

196
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,996
<font color="yellow">I suppose. He got taller, and his personality has changed.</font>

197
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,696
<font color="yellow">He was quite reversed when he was little.</font>

198
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,896
<font color="yellow">That's right. Gosh.</font>

199
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,496
<font color="yellow">He's so sly now. He keeps messing with me.</font>

200
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:34,826
<font color="yellow">I wish I could punch him...</font>

201
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,496
<font color="yellow">You saw him only for a minute. How did you figure out all that?</font>

202
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,556
<font color="yellow">It's amazing.</font>

203
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,226
<font color="yellow">It was only for a minute,</font>

204
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,156
<font color="yellow">but he's so much different from before.</font>

205
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:51,256
<font color="yellow">You're right. He's changed a lot.</font>

206
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,996
<font color="yellow">Instead, he got so handsome.</font>

207
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,396
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm not sure about that.</font>

208
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,396
<font color="yellow">Why not? Everybody says he's more handsome than me.</font>

209
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,196
<font color="yellow">No, he's not.</font>

210
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,926
<font color="yellow">You're a million times more handsome than he is.</font>

211
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,426
<font color="yellow">I'm flattered that you think so,</font>

212
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:14,156
<font color="yellow">but I can't really jump up and down with joy. I'll lose my face.</font>

213
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,356
<font color="yellow">You're really a million times more handsome.</font>

214
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,156
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

215
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:21,956
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

216
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:30,056
<font color="yellow">Let's begin your treatment.</font>

217
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,226
<font color="yellow">Do we have more patients?</font>

218
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,826
<font color="yellow">Ms. Joo Hye Jeong changed her appointment to tomorrow.</font>

219
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,996
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Let's finish up, then.</font>

220
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,626
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Hi, Brother.</font>

221
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,596
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here? You come here so often these days.</font>

222
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:50,596
<font color="yellow">So? Aren't you happy to see me? Should I just go?</font>

223
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:53,756
<font color="yellow">I am happy to see you.</font>

224
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,596
<font color="yellow">You still owe me a dinner.</font>

225
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,526
<font color="yellow">- You didn't buy me one before. - Goodness.</font>

226
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,626
<font color="yellow">Like someone said, you're sly.</font>

227
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,056
<font color="yellow">Who? Who said I'm sly? Who is it?</font>

228
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,026
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Who?</font>

229
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,326
<font color="yellow">Hello, there.</font>

230
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:13,526
<font color="yellow">I didn't expect to see you here.</font>

231
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:15,956
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

232
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,196
<font color="yellow">I'm having dinner with Jae Yi. You should come, too.</font>

233
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,896
<font color="yellow">You don't skip meals to lose weight, right?</font>

234
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,456
<font color="yellow">Sure. You should come. We can go to a buffet.</font>

235
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:25,056
<font color="yellow">No. I have plans.</font>

236
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,126
<font color="yellow">Really? Let's eat by ourselves, then.</font>

237
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:29,556
<font color="yellow">I should have a nice chat with my brother.</font>

238
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,826
<font color="yellow">I have so many things to tell him.</font>

239
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,156
<font color="yellow">Where are we eating?</font>

240
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,826
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. Are you seeing this?</font>

241
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,156
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

242
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,356
<font color="yellow">Do you want this?</font>

243
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,596
<font color="yellow">He's so sweet.</font>

244
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:21,596
<font color="yellow">It's seasoned konjac.</font>

245
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,026
<font color="yellow">It has much fiber, but it's low in calories.</font>

246
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,096
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and eat.</font>

247
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,996
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

248
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,156
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's...</font>

249
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,556
<font color="yellow">You're such a sweet guy, Jae Yi.</font>

250
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,196
<font color="yellow">This is why you're so popular among girls.</font>

251
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:38,696
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Bok Joo. Be careful.</font>

252
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:42,396
<font color="yellow">I feel bad to watch you only eat vegetables trying to lose weight.</font>

253
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,596
<font color="yellow">To lift weights... No, barbells...</font>

254
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,626
<font color="yellow">I mean to lift a cello, you should be strong.</font>

255
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:51,656
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for your concern.</font>

256
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,156
<font color="yellow">It's hard to be on a diet while studying music, right?</font>

257
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,496
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

258
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,826
<font color="yellow">Sure. Some people are gifted with strength.</font>

259
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,956
<font color="yellow">Look at her arms.</font>

260
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:08,356
<font color="yellow">Gosh. With arms like this, you'd be a great athlete.</font>

261
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,526
<font color="yellow">For example, something like this.</font>

262
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,426
<font color="yellow">Lifting 130kg!</font>

263
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:19,096
<font color="yellow">- No. I don't like sports. - Why not?</font>

264
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,596
<font color="yellow">You like soccer. Messi, in particular.</font>

265
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,526
<font color="yellow">- Messi? - She...</font>

266
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:30,026
<font color="yellow">asked me if I liked Messi when she first came to my clinic.</font>

267
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,296
<font color="yellow">She seemed to be a big fan of his.</font>

268
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:35,796
<font color="yellow">Do you like Messi?</font>

269
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,696
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm a big fan of Messi's.</font>

270
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,256
<font color="yellow">You're a fan of Messi's, too.</font>

271
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:50,496
<font color="yellow">That's right. Did you see him score yesterday?</font>

272
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,356
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He made a free kick and scored.</font>

273
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,956
<font color="yellow">From an angle like this, the ball...</font>

274
00:16:58,826 --> 00:16:59,926
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

275
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,226
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not busy. Yes.</font>

276
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:09,796
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

277
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:13,026
<font color="yellow">Do you and your friends ask everyone if they like Messi?</font>

278
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:16,026
<font color="yellow">Is Messi aware of this terrible fact?</font>

279
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:17,196
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

280
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:20,296
<font color="yellow">- How long are you going to do this? - Do what?</font>

281
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:23,266
<font color="yellow">- What am I doing? - Cut it out.</font>

282
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,266
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean. If I could just...</font>

283
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,396
<font color="yellow">Drink some water. You'll get indigestion.</font>

284
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,456
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

285
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:34,826
<font color="yellow">It was my close friend. Oh, the goal.</font>

286
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,026
<font color="yellow">It was fantastic. Did you see it?</font>

287
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,426
<font color="yellow">No, I watched weightlifting last night.</font>

288
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,996
<font color="yellow">Why would you watch weightlifting?</font>

289
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,726
<font color="yellow">On the game last night,</font>

290
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,226
<font color="yellow">they lifted weights like this.</font>

291
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:48,726
<font color="yellow">Please eat.</font>

292
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:58,926
<font color="yellow">Get in, Joon Hyung. You, too, Bok Joo.</font>

293
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,056
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

294
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,426
<font color="yellow">I'll give you two a ride. Get in.</font>

295
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,496
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

296
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,496
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung and I will stay and talk for a while.</font>

297
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:09,896
<font color="yellow">Talk about what? We've been talking all along.</font>

298
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:13,156
<font color="yellow">It's been 10 years. We have a lot to talk about.</font>

299
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,226
<font color="yellow">Let's catch up, shall we?</font>

300
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,226
<font color="yellow">That's right. You should spend some time together.</font>

301
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,596
<font color="yellow">You still have time until the roll call.</font>

302
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:21,296
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, then. I'll see you later at the clinic.</font>

303
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,826
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - Take good care of her.</font>

304
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,526
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi. I should go with you. Jae Yi.</font>

305
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:30,456
<font color="yellow">Take me with you. Jae Yi.</font>

306
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,426
<font color="yellow">Goodbye. Please drive safely.</font>

307
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:38,156
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to die? Jae Yi. Take me with you.</font>

308
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,056
<font color="yellow">You'd better follow me quietly.</font>

309
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,496
<font color="yellow">Let's not make a scene.</font>

310
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,826
<font color="yellow">Why are you lowering your voice? It's scary.</font>

311
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,126
<font color="yellow">Why are we here?</font>

312
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,496
<font color="yellow">- Joon Hyung. - Don't lower your voice.</font>

313
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,226
<font color="yellow">You're scaring me.</font>

314
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:12,996
<font color="yellow">You're not...</font>

315
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,626
<font color="yellow">going to kill me...</font>

316
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,326
<font color="yellow">and bury me, right?</font>

317
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,396
<font color="yellow">Let's make a deal.</font>

318
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,326
<font color="yellow">- What deal? - I'm always on the jig...</font>

319
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,596
<font color="yellow">because you might say something to someone.</font>

320
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:28,096
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this. It will kill me soon.</font>

321
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,496
<font color="yellow">I'll let you have a big one, and we'll call it a day.</font>

322
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,196
<font color="yellow">A big one?</font>

323
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,326
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

324
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:38,266
<font color="yellow">You should decide that.</font>

325
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,356
<font color="yellow">Here. Do you want to punch me?</font>

326
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,326
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

327
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:58,556
<font color="yellow">If you're going to shove your face to mine, give me a warning first.</font>

328
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,326
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm not a thug.</font>

329
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,266
<font color="yellow">What do you want, then? Money?</font>

330
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:06,926
<font color="yellow">How much money will you give me?</font>

331
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,456
<font color="yellow">I'm a little short on cash right now,</font>

332
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,126
<font color="yellow">but I'll try to raise some.</font>

333
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:17,196
<font color="yellow">How much will it take to keep you silent?</font>

334
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,656
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

335
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:27,056
<font color="yellow">I'm quite enjoying knowing your weakness.</font>

336
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:29,926
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

337
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,766
<font color="yellow">at the moment,</font>

338
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,656
<font color="yellow">I'm not really in need of money.</font>

339
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:37,956
<font color="yellow">But if I punch you,</font>

340
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,826
<font color="yellow">I'll just end up with a sore fist.</font>

341
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:42,996
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

342
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:49,326
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

343
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,396
<font color="yellow">Let's think about it carefully.</font>

344
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:55,996
<font color="yellow">I only have one chance,</font>

345
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,626
<font color="yellow">so I can't waste it.</font>

346
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:02,026
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming? We'll be late for the evening roll call.</font>

347
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:04,396
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

348
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,496
<font color="yellow">A deal.</font>

349
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:18,226
<font color="yellow">How did she even come up with that?</font>

350
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:23,226
<font color="yellow">That girl, Bok Joo, is such a lunatic.</font>

351
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:27,996
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey.</font>

352
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,196
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

353
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,056
<font color="yellow">- Did you see Ki Seok? - No, I didn't.</font>

354
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,626
<font color="yellow">- Why? Did he say he'll kill me? - Yes.</font>

355
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:39,156
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

356
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:40,766
<font color="yellow">There's more?</font>

357
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,496
<font color="yellow">He said he'll make you lift a big bag of rice.</font>

358
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:46,056
<font color="yellow">That's what everyone hates the most at the track meet.</font>

359
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,356
<font color="yellow">No one wants to do it, so that jerk put your name down for it.</font>

360
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,656
<font color="yellow">It's what you're getting for not showing up.</font>

361
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,826
<font color="yellow">You should've stopped him, you idiot.</font>

362
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,826
<font color="yellow">How exactly was I supposed to do it?</font>

363
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,796
<font color="yellow">I have no power whatsoever.</font>

364
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:59,556
<font color="yellow">How can I stop that jerk?</font>

365
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:02,656
<font color="yellow">Just accept it, okay?</font>

366
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:05,656
<font color="yellow">It won't look cool, but you should just do it and get it over with.</font>

367
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,356
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I'm going to disappear that day.</font>

368
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,196
<font color="yellow">How will you handle the consequences?</font>

369
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:12,026
<font color="yellow">It's not like that sociopath will become fond of me after that.</font>

370
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:13,826
<font color="yellow">I'd much rather get scolded...</font>

371
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,426
<font color="yellow">and punished later.</font>

372
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,296
<font color="yellow">I'm going to run away,</font>

373
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,596
<font color="yellow">so you better keep your mouth shut about it. Are we clear?</font>

374
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:21,356
<font color="yellow">I don't even know any more. Do whatever you want.</font>

375
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:23,456
<font color="yellow">What are you going to be doing?</font>

376
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,896
<font color="yellow">I've been assigned with something. Cheer...</font>

377
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,426
<font color="yellow">- What? - Cheer... Cheer...</font>

378
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,356
<font color="yellow">Stop mumbling, will you?</font>

379
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,456
<font color="yellow">Cheerleading. Cheerleading, you punk.</font>

380
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:34,796
<font color="yellow">I'll be a cheerleader.</font>

381
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:54,826
<font color="yellow">Jeong Joon Hyung.</font>

382
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,296
<font color="yellow">You sneaked out again yesterday.</font>

383
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,796
<font color="yellow">I guess you're going to consider the duck walk as part of the training.</font>

384
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,556
<font color="yellow">Something came up at home.</font>

385
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:07,326
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

386
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:10,156
<font color="yellow">I should refrain from giving you any muscle-building punishment.</font>

387
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,696
<font color="yellow">The pool water will start getting cold now.</font>

388
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,826
<font color="yellow">Just clean the pool, you idiot.</font>

389
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:20,826
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

390
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,696
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be okay?</font>

391
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:26,256
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to handle Ki Seok if he loses it.</font>

392
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:28,996
<font color="yellow">I don't even know. I'll worry about it when I have to. My head hurts.</font>

393
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:31,696
<font color="yellow">How's your cheerleading practice going?</font>

394
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:34,226
<font color="yellow">It's going all right.</font>

395
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:35,896
<font color="yellow">I need to pick a color for my uniform.</font>

396
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,626
<font color="yellow">Shall I go for silver or pretty purple?</font>

397
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,826
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

398
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,426
<font color="yellow">You seem to be enjoying it.</font>

399
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:45,796
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I'm totally enjoying it.</font>

400
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,596
<font color="yellow">I've never been so focused in my entire life.</font>

401
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,456
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

402
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:53,156
<font color="yellow">What's your problem?</font>

403
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:54,696
<font color="yellow">Did you have good training?</font>

404
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,696
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for you to grab pizza with you.</font>

405
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:00,756
<font color="yellow">You like wood-fired pizza.</font>

406
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,826
<font color="yellow">I found a good place.</font>

407
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,096
<font color="yellow">- Have a great time. - Hey.</font>

408
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:08,526
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

409
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,656
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this, seriously?</font>

410
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:15,996
<font color="yellow">I want to try my best.</font>

411
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,926
<font color="yellow">Just get used to it.</font>

412
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:20,126
<font color="yellow">Relationships aren't like sports.</font>

413
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,426
<font color="yellow">Effort does not guarantee success.</font>

414
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,026
<font color="yellow">I still want to give my all and see if it makes a difference.</font>

415
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,556
<font color="yellow">I can only give up when I know that it's absolutely not possible.</font>

416
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,796
<font color="yellow">I was fine when I was in Taereung, but seeing you made me realize...</font>

417
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:33,726
<font color="yellow">that I can't give up.</font>

418
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:35,826
<font color="yellow">You're the only thing...</font>

419
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:38,226
<font color="yellow">I can hold onto now.</font>

420
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:40,956
<font color="yellow">Learn to stand on your own two feet.</font>

421
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,496
<font color="yellow">Everyone lives his or her own life.</font>

422
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:46,726
<font color="yellow">You can't expect anyone...</font>

423
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:49,626
<font color="yellow">to solve your problem.</font>

424
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,696
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go for pizza with you.</font>

425
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,126
<font color="yellow">Gosh, your hair.</font>

426
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,796
<font color="yellow">I told you that you have to dry your hair properly.</font>

427
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:09,826
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if you catch a cold?</font>

428
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,126
<font color="yellow">I was in a rush because of someone.</font>

429
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:14,596
<font color="yellow">- Let's go for pizza. - What?</font>

430
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,496
<font color="yellow">I want to watch you eat.</font>

431
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,956
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to watch you watching me eat.</font>

432
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:21,726
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

433
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,326
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

434
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:26,396
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

435
00:25:26,656 --> 00:25:27,656
<font color="yellow">Wait up!</font>

436
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,056
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

437
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,556
<font color="yellow">I'll accept my punishment.</font>

438
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,256
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever you think I deserve...</font>

439
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:46,526
<font color="yellow">if it means we can get back together.</font>

440
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,496
<font color="yellow">You guys know that the track meet is finally happening tomorrow, right?</font>

441
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:53,726
<font color="yellow">- Yes! - Yes!</font>

442
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:56,456
<font color="yellow">What's our slogan, guys?</font>

443
00:25:58,426 --> 00:25:59,596
<font color="yellow">"The Best Team with the Best Teamwork".</font>

444
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:01,526
<font color="yellow">Let's flaunt our strong teamwork...</font>

445
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,896
<font color="yellow">and show everyone that the track meet is our day.</font>

446
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:06,726
<font color="yellow">Let's prove it to everyone once again.</font>

447
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,056
<font color="yellow">- Okay! - Okay!</font>

448
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:09,696
<font color="yellow">- Attention. - Professor.</font>

449
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,256
<font color="yellow">Why is it our day?</font>

450
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:14,256
<font color="yellow">Ye Bin, that's a great question.</font>

451
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:15,696
<font color="yellow">You freshmen probably don't know yet.</font>

452
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:17,796
<font color="yellow">Since the very first track meet,</font>

453
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:19,796
<font color="yellow">our weightlifting team has always won...</font>

454
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:22,656
<font color="yellow">the first place due to our remarkable strength,</font>

455
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,296
<font color="yellow">endurance, and perseverance.</font>

456
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,356
<font color="yellow">It goes all the way back to 1991...</font>

457
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,796
<font color="yellow">- when I was a freshman... - Professor.</font>

458
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:30,896
<font color="yellow">You said you have a meeting in the afternoon.</font>

459
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,826
<font color="yellow">Right, I forgot.</font>

460
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,656
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you guys next time.</font>

461
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:35,926
<font color="yellow">You're dismissed.</font>

462
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,456
<font color="yellow">Attention. Bow.</font>

463
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:38,896
<font color="yellow">- Thank you! - Thank you!</font>

464
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:44,226
<font color="yellow">- We're going to teach you a lesson. - You better watch out.</font>

465
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,756
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

466
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,356
<font color="yellow">I overheard the conversation between Professor Yoon and Coach Choi.</font>

467
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,096
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi is changing his weight class.</font>

468
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,956
<font color="yellow">Why would he do that all of a sudden?</font>

469
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,596
<font color="yellow">It's obviously a strategy.</font>

470
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,826
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi is strong, so if he bulks up a little,</font>

471
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,056
<font color="yellow">he can surely aim for that class as well.</font>

472
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,226
<font color="yellow">Also, you two are in the same weight class now.</font>

473
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,926
<font color="yellow">Then I'd be grateful.</font>

474
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,956
<font color="yellow">So he wasn't practicing for the semi-professional match?</font>

475
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:08,796
<font color="yellow">- I guess not. - I feel so apologetic suddenly.</font>

476
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,996
<font color="yellow">(Weightlifting Department)</font>

477
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,556
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for today. - Bye, guys.</font>

478
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:44,656
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

479
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,226
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

480
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,096
<font color="yellow">Why would you bulk up just before graduation?</font>

481
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:53,196
<font color="yellow">Do you feel that responsible as a team leader?</font>

482
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:54,796
<font color="yellow">I just want to do it.</font>

483
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,626
<font color="yellow">I want to test my limits.</font>

484
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:58,096
<font color="yellow">Your limits? Whatever.</font>

485
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,396
<font color="yellow">It could ruin your health.</font>

486
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:04,596
<font color="yellow">Hey, learn to put yourself first.</font>

487
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:07,796
<font color="yellow">Don't go overboard for us. Think about yourself first.</font>

488
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,326
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

489
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:16,456

<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

492
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,126
<font color="yellow">Shall we wrap the weight training...</font>

493
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,296
<font color="yellow">and go to play a game for an hour?</font>

494
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,156
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't want to.</font>

495
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:39,326
<font color="yellow">Hey, our fingers need exercise, too.</font>

496
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,096
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll tell Ki Seok that you won't show up tomorrow.</font>

497
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:45,826
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want. You jerk.</font>

498
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,226
<font color="yellow">Come on, Joon Hyung. Let's go, please!</font>

499
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:03,996
<font color="yellow">He's supposed to be my friend,</font>

500
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:06,726
<font color="yellow">but he never cooperates.</font>

501
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:09,896
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good meal?</font>

502
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:11,696
<font color="yellow">I'm practicing right now.</font>

503
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:18,626
<font color="yellow">What means happiness for me?</font>

504
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,296
<font color="yellow">Getting into the national team?</font>

505
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:23,696
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

506
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:27,896
<font color="yellow">Give me your arm.</font>

507
00:29:30,456 --> 00:29:32,826

508

510

<font color="yellow">Don't be too difficult.</font>

514
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,026

518

<font color="yellow">He's popular?</font>

522
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,726
<font color="yellow">Is he really seeing someone now?</font>

523
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,296
<font color="yellow">I guess it still bothers you.</font>

524

<font color="yellow">I'm not bothered by it.</font>

525
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,356
<font color="yellow">I'm just curious.</font>

526
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,596

527

00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:29,096
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have been friends with him in the first place.</font>

611
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,456
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

612
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,026
<font color="yellow">if Joon Hyung...</font>

613
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:36,666
<font color="yellow">doesn't participate in the game of lifting bags of rice,</font>

614
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:39,996
<font color="yellow">he'll be at the risk of being destroyed by his senior?</font>

615
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:41,056
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

616
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:43,166
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

617
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:00,056
<font color="yellow">Why is he calling me so much?</font>

618
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,096
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

619
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,496
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you answered. It's me.</font>

620
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,166
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

621
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,196
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo?</font>

622
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:15,666
<font color="yellow">I got your number from your friend. I think today's the day.</font>

623
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,296
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

624
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:22,056
<font color="yellow">Let's make that deal we talked about before.</font>

625
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:25,956
<font color="yellow">- What? - Listen to me carefully.</font>

626
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:28,456
<font color="yellow">I'm going to save you today.</font>

627
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,426
<font color="yellow">In return, don't ever tease me again...</font>

628
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,096
<font color="yellow">about my weakness, okay?</font>

629
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:37,996
<font color="yellow">I'll take that as a yes.</font>

630
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:42,356
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chubs. Bok Joo.</font>

631
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:44,056
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

632
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:49,096
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo? What's going on? - The phone is turned off...</font>

633
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:52,896
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

634
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,426
<font color="yellow">Am I sick?</font>

635
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:58,026
<font color="yellow">Looking at those bags of rice makes me want to do something.</font>

636
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,556
<font color="yellow">Guys, I think Hyung Chul is hungry again after seeing the bags of rice.</font>

637
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:03,996
<font color="yellow">It's unfortunate.</font>

638
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:07,356
<font color="yellow">If the weightlifting team could participate in this game,</font>

639
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,756
<font color="yellow">- we'd be the winner. - Come on.</font>

640
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,666
<font color="yellow">That would be unfair.</font>

641
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:15,196
<font color="yellow">If the track and field team runs relay races and jumps hurdles,</font>

642
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:17,496
<font color="yellow">the track meet would be a talent show.</font>

643
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:19,056
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

644
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,596
<font color="yellow">If the judo team defeats the swimming team,</font>

645
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:26,096
<font color="yellow">we'll definitely be the winners.</font>

646
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,126
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

647
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:29,896
<font color="yellow">There's no way the swimming team is stronger than the judo team.</font>

648
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:38,596
<font color="yellow">- Judo Team. - Let's go, Judo Team.</font>

649
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:41,256
<font color="yellow">- Judo Team. - You can do it.</font>

650
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:44,056
<font color="yellow">- Come on, let's go. - You can do it.</font>

651
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:47,126
<font color="yellow">Participants from the swimming team, please step forward.</font>

652
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:50,166
<font color="yellow">Swimming Team, are you giving up already?</font>

653
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:53,556
<font color="yellow">Anyone who's strong should step forward.</font>

654
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,666
<font color="yellow">I'm here. I'm right here.</font>

655
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,356
<font color="yellow">Here I am.</font>

656
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:02,296
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

657
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,996
<font color="yellow">but the person who was supposed to participate is sick.</font>

658
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:06,326
<font color="yellow">Instead of him,</font>

659
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:08,696
<font color="yellow">can someone else play?</font>

660
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:10,626
<font color="yellow">- Someone else? - Who?</font>

661
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,096
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Where on earth is Joon Hyung?</font>

662
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:15,226
<font color="yellow">I couldn't find him.</font>

663
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:17,826
<font color="yellow">Isn't it more important to win?</font>

664
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:19,896
<font color="yellow">- Hold him back. - Why you...</font>

665
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:21,896
<font color="yellow">Here's the player...</font>

666
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,926
<font color="yellow">who will represent the swimming team in lifting bags of rice.</font>

667
00:39:25,926 --> 00:39:26,996
<font color="yellow">(Gymnastics Team)</font>

668
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,026
<font color="yellow">(Swimming Team)</font>

669
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:52,496
<font color="yellow">Who is that?</font>

670
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,596
<font color="yellow">All right, this player...</font>

671
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:59,926
<font color="yellow">will participate in place of Joon Hyung...</font>

672
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,096
<font color="yellow">and represent the swimming team.</font>

673
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:05,196
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Get back here. - You've lost your mind.</font>

674
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,096
<font color="yellow">Give her a round of applause.</font>

675
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,496
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with her? - I don't know, but she's crazy.</font>

676
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,666
<font color="yellow">Did you know about this?</font>

677
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:16,256
<font color="yellow">We're running late, so we'll allow her to participate.</font>

678
00:40:20,496 --> 00:40:25,396
<font color="yellow">For the first round, we'll start with 40kg!</font>

679
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,526
<font color="yellow">That's so easy. I'm sure she can lift 40kg with one hand.</font>

680
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:30,666
<font color="yellow">Are we allowed to do this?</font>

681
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,096
<font color="yellow">- Nice! - Okay, great!</font>

682
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:35,396
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Did you guys see that?</font>

683
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,796
<font color="yellow">- That was awesome. - My goodness.</font>

684
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:43,056
<font color="yellow">This time, it's four bags.</font>

685
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,456
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

686
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,326
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my! - Amazing!</font>

687
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:51,026
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

688
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:53,596
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

689
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:56,196
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

690
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:59,996
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

691
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:01,126
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

692
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,896
<font color="yellow">- She did it. - Nicely done!</font>

693
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:07,426
<font color="yellow">Let's move on to the final round.</font>

694
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,956
<font color="yellow">They'll lift five bags this time. Go!</font>

695
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,166
<font color="yellow">This is the last round.</font>

696
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,426
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo. - Kim Bok Joo.</font>

697
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:25,096
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - My goodness.</font>

698
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,926
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Go, weightlifting team!</font>

699
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:30,526
<font color="yellow">- Kim Bok Joo! - Kim Bok Joo!</font>

700
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,496
<font color="yellow">- Oh, no! - No!</font>

701
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:34,796
<font color="yellow">- He lost. - Hey!</font>

702
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,126
<font color="yellow">What was he doing, seriously?</font>

703
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,596
<font color="yellow">We got the second place because of you!</font>

704
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,426
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, I'm so angry. - Bok Joo!</font>

705
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:49,626
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

706
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:50,956
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo!</font>

707
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:52,626
<font color="yellow">- Good work! - You were amazing!</font>

708
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:54,396
<font color="yellow">- We need better teamwork. - We've never lost.</font>

709
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:56,526
<font color="yellow">- Guys, it's okay. - It's too bad.</font>

710
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:57,826
<font color="yellow">We got the second place.</font>

711
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:00,296
<font color="yellow">Good work, everyone.</font>

712
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:03,296
<font color="yellow">Winning the second place...</font>

713
00:42:03,456 --> 00:42:04,996
<font color="yellow">is good enough, of course.</font>

714
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:08,196
<font color="yellow">We can't win the first place every time.</font>

715
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:12,756
<font color="yellow">We should pat ourselves on the back for beating...</font>

716
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,956
<font color="yellow">the judo team at the tug-of-war match.</font>

717
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,826
<font color="yellow">Of course...</font>

718
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:20,456
<font color="yellow">I'm very sad that our legacy as the strongest team was broken...</font>

719
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:22,166
<font color="yellow">while I'm in charge of the team.</font>

720
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:26,256
<font color="yellow">Not even two points.</font>

721
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:28,056
<font color="yellow">One point would've been enough...</font>

722
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:30,166
<font color="yellow">to make us the co-champion.</font>

723
00:42:32,896 --> 00:42:34,396
<font color="yellow">It's not the end of the world, though.</font>

724
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:38,126
<font color="yellow">Process matters more than outcome.</font>

725
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:40,926
<font color="yellow">I'm happy if you guys had fun.</font>

726
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:42,596
<font color="yellow">Eat. Eat up.</font>

727
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:45,456
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to eat, Professor?</font>

728
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:48,296
<font color="yellow">I don't really have any appetite. I'm not going to eat anything!</font>

729
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:52,626
<font color="yellow">Well, I mean...</font>

730
00:42:53,826 --> 00:42:55,926
<font color="yellow">Eat it and get some rest, okay?</font>

731
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:02,956
<font color="yellow">Good work, everyone.</font>

732
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,326
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to massage your muscles,</font>

733
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,256
<font color="yellow">and don't be late tomorrow.</font>

734
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:11,226
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Kim Bok Joo, that little...</font>

735
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,526
<font color="yellow">Do they want us to eat this or not?</font>

736
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:18,796
<font color="yellow">This isn't even much. Professor Yoon is so mean.</font>

737
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,996
<font color="yellow">We were so close to winning, though. We lost by one point.</font>

738
00:43:21,456 --> 00:43:24,166
<font color="yellow">Exactly. You should've run faster.</font>

739
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:27,056
<font color="yellow">We could've earned 5 points if you got into the top 3.</font>

740
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,926
<font color="yellow">Why are you putting the blame on me?</font>

741
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:34,496
<font color="yellow">What did they call her again? A helper? A rat?</font>

742
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:35,826
<font color="yellow">If she didn't betray us,</font>

743
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:37,626
<font color="yellow">the swimming team wouldn't have won.</font>

744
00:43:37,926 --> 00:43:38,956
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

745
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:40,196
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

746
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:44,296
<font color="yellow">What on earth were you thinking?</font>

747
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:47,296
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that this would be the outcome. I'm sorry.</font>

748
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,696
<font color="yellow">You're a psycho if you did it expecting this outcome.</font>

749
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,526
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't eat that burger.</font>

750
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:54,096
<font color="yellow">Go to the swimming team and ask for one. Don't eat it!</font>

751
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:56,926
<font color="yellow">That's enough, guys. What's done is done.</font>

752
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,096
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

753
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:00,996
<font color="yellow">You should clean up everything after.</font>

754
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:02,696
<font color="yellow">You should do that, right?</font>

755
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:05,496
<font color="yellow">That's such a light punishment.</font>

756
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:08,126
<font color="yellow">That's way too light of a punishment for a betrayer.</font>

757
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:10,056
<font color="yellow">You're really something.</font>

758
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:12,756
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

759
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:14,826
<font color="yellow">Get your act together, will you?</font>

760
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:16,956
<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

761
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,326
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I don't even know what to tell you.</font>

762
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:29,356
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

763
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:32,256
<font color="yellow">You have a crush on Joon Hyung, don't you?</font>

764
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,356
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

765
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,026
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

766
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,226
<font color="yellow">Don't lie to my face.</font>

767
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:39,226
<font color="yellow">You can't fool me.</font>

768
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:42,356
<font color="yellow">That's the only plausible explanation.</font>

769
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:44,596
<font color="yellow">A substitute? Whatever.</font>

770
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:48,156
<font color="yellow">Why would you stand in for him and help the swimming team?</font>

771
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:50,326
<font color="yellow">You obviously like him.</font>

772
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:52,156
<font color="yellow">That's why you risked worsening...</font>

773
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,526
<font color="yellow">the condition you have and lifted all of those bags.</font>

774
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,756
<font color="yellow">I knew that something was up between the two of you.</font>

775
00:44:56,926 --> 00:44:57,926
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo.</font>

776
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,426
<font color="yellow">- Is that really what happened? - Not at all!</font>

777
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,656
<font color="yellow">I wish I could turn my heart inside out and show you.</font>

778
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:05,126
<font color="yellow">- You're driving me crazy. - You're driving us crazy.</font>

779
00:45:05,326 --> 00:45:07,596
<font color="yellow">Then explain why you did what you did so that we can understand.</font>

780
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:08,996
<font color="yellow">You got it all wrong.</font>

781
00:45:09,826 --> 00:45:12,656
<font color="yellow">- I don't like him. - You do like him. I can tell.</font>

782
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:15,256
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you did that because of a guy.</font>

783
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,556
<font color="yellow">How can you betray us?</font>

784
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:20,396
<font color="yellow">I really...</font>

785
00:45:20,896 --> 00:45:22,326
<font color="yellow">That's really not what happened!</font>

786
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:25,626
<font color="yellow">Hey, you should've stopped her.</font>

787
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:27,956
<font color="yellow">How can you just let her do that?</font>

788
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:29,456
<font color="yellow">She said she was indebted to you.</font>

789
00:45:29,456 --> 00:45:31,356
<font color="yellow">She wanted to do it so that she can call it even,</font>

790
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:32,696
<font color="yellow">so I couldn't stop her.</font>

791
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:34,926
<font color="yellow">Shut it, you fool. This puts her in such an awkward situation.</font>

792
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:37,456
<font color="yellow">The weightlifting team lost because of her.</font>

793
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:38,826
<font color="yellow">She has become a traitor to them!</font>

794
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:42,096
<font color="yellow">It's just a track meet. Don't be so dramatic.</font>

795
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:43,826
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying. You piece of...</font>

796
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,026
<font color="yellow">Oh, there she is.</font>

797
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:47,126
<font color="yellow">Girls, believe me.</font>

798
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:48,556
<font color="yellow">That's really not what happened, okay?</font>

799
00:45:48,556 --> 00:45:50,156
<font color="yellow">- All right, we heard you. - I'll explain.</font>

800
00:45:50,156 --> 00:45:52,896
<font color="yellow">- We heard you. - Enough. We already figured it out.</font>

801
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:00,496
<font color="yellow">Hey, no, no. It's not what you're thinking.</font>

802
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:02,826
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

803
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:05,296
<font color="yellow">- All right. Let go of me first. - Bok Joo...</font>

804
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,426
<font color="yellow">Okay, but let go of me. I said, let go!</font>

805
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:13,026
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why is that jerk dragging Bok Joo?</font>

806
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:14,656
<font color="yellow">Where is he taking her? Where?</font>

807
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:15,896
<font color="yellow">It looks like we have a big problem.</font>

808
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,656
<font color="yellow">What is this about? What do you want?</font>

809
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,726
<font color="yellow">What on earth were you thinking?</font>

810
00:46:22,896 --> 00:46:24,956
<font color="yellow">I told you on the phone. We're even now.</font>

811
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:27,996
<font color="yellow">I no longer want to worry about you exposing it,</font>

812
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:29,326
<font color="yellow">and I'm done with being teased by you.</font>

813
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:30,796
<font color="yellow">What's your problem? Shall I explain more?</font>

814
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,496
<font color="yellow">You're insane if you go ahead and reveal my secret after this.</font>

815
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,196
<font color="yellow">Be sure to keep your mouth shut from this moment on.</font>

816
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:39,796
<font color="yellow">You better keep my secret safe.</font>

817
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:41,256
<font color="yellow">What kind of person do you think I am?</font>

818
00:46:41,956 --> 00:46:43,756
<font color="yellow">Even if you think I'm thoughtless,</font>

819
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:46,296
<font color="yellow">how can you assume that I'd tell your team members?</font>

820
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:47,696
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

821
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:49,726
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Doctor Jeong.</font>

822
00:46:52,296 --> 00:46:54,126
<font color="yellow">He's your brother. What if you let it slip?</font>

823
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:59,196
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to think that I'm a liar,</font>

824
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:01,526
<font color="yellow">so please don't tell him, okay?</font>

825
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:04,756
<font color="yellow">Do you like him that much?</font>

826
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,796
<font color="yellow">Why? What do you like about him?</font>

827
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:12,826
<font color="yellow">Yes, I like him. What's the problem?</font>

828
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,126
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to like a guy or what?</font>

829
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:17,726
<font color="yellow">I don't even expect him to like me back.</font>

830
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:20,226
<font color="yellow">I just want to see him and like him. Can't I even do that?</font>

831
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:24,256
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I ended up falling for your brother.</font>

832
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:36,026
<font color="yellow">So what do you think?</font>

833
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:39,026
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo likes your friend, doesn't she?</font>

834
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:42,926
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not too sure. I can't really tell.</font>

835
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:45,396
<font color="yellow">What are you saying exactly?</font>

836
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:46,726
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm just...</font>

837
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:49,256
<font color="yellow">I can be a little wishy-washy.</font>

838
00:47:50,096 --> 00:47:52,526
<font color="yellow">I'm just realizing that we don't even know each other's names...</font>

839
00:47:52,526 --> 00:47:54,426
<font color="yellow">even though we've met many times.</font>

840
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:56,896
<font color="yellow">I'm Cho Tae Kwon from the swimming team.</font>

841
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:01,526
<font color="yellow">I'm Jeong Nan Hee from the weightlifting team.</font>

842
00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:04,656
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Seon Ok.</font>

843
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:06,596
<font color="yellow">Nice you meet you both.</font>

844
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:09,296
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to get to know cool girls like you... First off,</font>

845
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:12,656
<font color="yellow">I must apologize to you for the mishap caused by my foolish friend.</font>

846
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:14,656
<font color="yellow">I'm happy we've become friends.</font>

847
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,526
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. We don't have any...</font>

848
00:48:17,526 --> 00:48:19,396
<font color="yellow">hard feelings towards you, Tae Kwon.</font>

849
00:48:20,426 --> 00:48:22,256
<font color="yellow">Your friend is the problem.</font>

850
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:24,926
<font color="yellow">I think he's toying with Bok Joo's feelings.</font>

851
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,496
<font color="yellow">It looks like he's leading her on.</font>

852
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:30,896
<font color="yellow">Right. He can be like that.</font>

853
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:32,696
<font color="yellow">He's a little full of himself,</font>

854
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:34,826
<font color="yellow">and he plays games with people's emotions.</font>

855
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:38,256
<font color="yellow">I told him numerous times that he'd end up being punished...</font>

856
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:41,456
<font color="yellow">for his deeds, but he never listens to any of my advice.</font>

857
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:42,456
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

858
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:46,396
<font color="yellow">I'll guide him to the best of my ability so that there's no problem.</font>

859
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:48,126
<font color="yellow">You should.</font>

860
00:48:48,496 --> 00:48:50,896
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that we're on the same page.</font>

861
00:48:51,356 --> 00:48:53,896
<font color="yellow">This is a little awkward, though. Can we just talk casually?</font>

862
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:55,296
<font color="yellow">Of course! By all means.</font>

863
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:57,156
<font color="yellow">Talk to me however you want. I don't care.</font>

864
00:48:57,656 --> 00:48:58,726
<font color="yellow">Okay, Tae Kwon.</font>

865
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:00,826
<font color="yellow">- Great stuff, Nan Ok. - Nan...</font>

866
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:01,996
<font color="yellow">I'm Nan Hee.</font>

867
00:49:01,996 --> 00:49:03,096
<font color="yellow">- Her name is Seon Ok. - Let's go.</font>

868
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:04,326
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Seon Ok.</font>

869
00:49:04,326 --> 00:49:05,726
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Did he reject her?</font>

870
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,496
<font color="yellow">- Goodness! - Hey, Bok Joo!</font>

871
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:13,626
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

872
00:49:14,096 --> 00:49:15,156
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

873
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:16,726
<font color="yellow">I was so nervous.</font>

874
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:19,826
<font color="yellow">Why are they so scary? What took you so long?</font>

875
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:21,756
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my legs are wobbly.</font>

876
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:30,926
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

877
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:33,626
<font color="yellow">Drink away and forget everything.</font>

878
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:35,526
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

879
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:38,356
<font color="yellow">Dating a handsome guy would be too nerve-racking.</font>

880
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:40,926
<font color="yellow">Enough! I told you that is not what's going on.</font>

881
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:43,896
<font color="yellow">Right. There's no point in talking about what's already done.</font>

882
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:45,726
<font color="yellow">Just forget about him!</font>

883
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:48,226
<font color="yellow">Think whatever you want.</font>

884
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:49,926
<font color="yellow">It doesn't even matter.</font>

885
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:54,526
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'll hook you up with guys.</font>

886
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:55,556
<font color="yellow">I know so many guys.</font>

887
00:49:56,056 --> 00:49:57,796
<font color="yellow">What do you think of him? He's in rowing.</font>

888
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,326
<font color="yellow">I have my eyes on him, but I'll introduce you to him...</font>

889
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:01,326
<font color="yellow">if he's your type.</font>

890
00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:05,526
<font color="yellow">Or... What was his name? Tae Kwon? What do you think of him?</font>

891
00:50:05,526 --> 00:50:07,796
<font color="yellow">He seems like a much easier target than Joon Hyung.</font>

892
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:10,326
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo has standards, too. Don't be so ridiculous.</font>

893
00:50:10,326 --> 00:50:12,296
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

894
00:50:12,296 --> 00:50:15,156
<font color="yellow">I think he's cute. He'll be easy to deal with.</font>

895
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:17,156
<font color="yellow">He's also pretty stylish and sweet.</font>

896
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,696
<font color="yellow">Sure. You like all guys.</font>

897
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:20,826
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and date everyone.</font>

898
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:25,026
<font color="yellow">I miss him so much.</font>

899
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:27,326
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo.</font>

900
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,596
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her.</font>

901
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:34,256
<font color="yellow">I miss him so much.</font>

902
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,496
<font color="yellow">I miss him.</font>

903
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:41,756
<font color="yellow">I really do.</font>

904
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:49,526
<font color="yellow">I really miss him.</font>

905
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:12,356
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

906
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:15,726
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you something?</font>

907
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:18,626
<font color="yellow">Sure. What is it?</font>

908
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:20,326
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

909
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:24,356
<font color="yellow">lift the rice bags for Joon Hyung yesterday?</font>

910
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:27,196

<font color="yellow">By the way, does she really like you?</font>

956

<font color="yellow">Her friends seem to think that way.</font>

957
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:19,756
