- Jae Yi. Are you going to be late?</font>

00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:16,495
<font color="yellow">No, I won't be late.</font>

3
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:18,495
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the dumplings we ate the other day?</font>

4
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,695
<font color="yellow">- You mean the dim sum?
- Yes, that one.</font>

5
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,525
<font color="yellow">- I'll buy some on my way home.
- Okay.</font>

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,125
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

7
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:31,825
<font color="yellow">You must be bored.</font>

8
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,565
<font color="yellow">Do you want some gum?</font>

9
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,295
<font color="yellow">It's sugar-free, so don't worry.</font>

10
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:40,895
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

11
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:53,695
<font color="yellow">I don't have water in my car.</font>

12
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:58,365
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't worry. I'll just hold my breath.</font>

13
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:15,265
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I was so silly.</font>

14
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,325
<font color="yellow">Things were going great, and I blew it.</font>

15
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:25,565
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I kept you waiting.</font>

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,895
<font color="yellow">I couldn't find a convenience store.</font>

17
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:30,095
<font color="yellow">I got a warm beverage from the vending machine.</font>

18

19
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,595
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

20
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,525
<font color="yellow">How is it? Are you okay now?</font>

21
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:45,865
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

22
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,625
<font color="yellow">The wind is cold in the morning and evening.</font>

23

24
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,425
<font color="yellow">You still have hiccups. Drink some more.</font>

25
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:10,625
<font color="yellow">Drink some more.</font>

26
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,695
<font color="yellow">You can drink as much as you want. It's just tea.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

49
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,565
<font color="yellow">How unlucky. I have a game today.</font>

50
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,665
<font color="yellow">Mom. Do we have waterproof Band-Aids?</font>

51
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,195

<font color="yellow">after the first three.</font>

56
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:38,295
<font color="yellow">It looked like...</font>

57
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,695
<font color="yellow">someone tried to imitate my mom's handwriting.</font>

58
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:45,165
<font color="yellow">It was your aunt.</font>

59
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:48,695
<font color="yellow">Is that day...</font>

60
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:52,525
<font color="yellow">Yes. It was the day of the game that I had symptoms for the first time.</font>

61
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:56,695
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

62
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,365
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it wasn't easy for you to tell me that.</font>

63
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,965
<font color="yellow">Do you think it has something to do with my symptoms?</font>

64
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:06,965
<font color="yellow">Probably.</font>

65
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,695
<font color="yellow">Like I told you before...</font>

<font color="yellow">"Panic disorder and conversion disorder are diseases of the heart."</font>

67

<font color="yellow">It can cause hearing problems, too.</font>

68
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:24,095
<font color="yellow">I suppose you were quite shocked on that day.</font>

69
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,325
<font color="yellow">I guess you felt like you lost...</font>

70
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,425
<font color="yellow">the only connection you had with your mother.</font>

71
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:34,625
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

72
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,565
<font color="yellow">We now know what might have caused your problem.</font>

73
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,695
<font color="yellow">Let's take it slow to solve it.</font>

74
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,265
<font color="yellow">Telling me about it may have cured it by half.</font>

75
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,625
<font color="yellow">Then... Let's see.</font>

76
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,925
<font color="yellow">Which method will be...</font>

77
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:53,325
<font color="yellow">the most effective for you?</font>

78
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,065
<font color="yellow">I think we need to do an experiment.</font>

79
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,365
<font color="yellow">When is your next game?</font>

80
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,465
<font color="yellow">Thank you for giving me a ride. Please drive safely.</font>

81
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:56,495
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? What is she wearing?</font>

82
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,525
<font color="yellow">I set her up with a good chance. She should be wearing...</font>

83
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:02,495
<font color="yellow">a pretty dress and show off her charms. Only then,</font>

84
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:05,595
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi would say, "You look so charming today, Bok Joo."</font>

85
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:06,825
<font color="yellow">But with those clothes,</font>

86
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,225
<font color="yellow">it all goes down the drain.</font>

87
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,495
<font color="yellow">Let me drop you off at your house.</font>

88
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:14,465
<font color="yellow">It's not polite to let a woman go home by herself at night.</font>

89
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:17,625
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine. I can go home from here even with my eyes shut.</font>

90
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,095
<font color="yellow">I also need to stop by at the supermarket to buy something.</font>

91
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,595
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you at the clinic.</font>

92
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,425
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to do some stretches before you go to sleep.</font>

93
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,465
<font color="yellow">Okay. Goodbye.</font>

94
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,325
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

95
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,895
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're going to break your back, Bok Joo.</font>

96
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,765
<font color="yellow">I can't watch this.</font>

97
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,565
<font color="yellow">What should I do with you, Bok Joo?</font>

98
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:41,965
<font color="yellow">Are you happy, Bok Joo? Are you?</font>

99
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,095
<font color="yellow">Where is she going?</font>

100
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,125
<font color="yellow">She never takes the subway.</font>

101
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,865
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

102
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,325
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

103
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:19,865
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

104
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,695
<font color="yellow">Okay, there she is.</font>

105
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,295
<font color="yellow">Did I catch a cold?</font>

106
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:40,465
<font color="yellow">It's because of the dress.</font>

107
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:43,365
<font color="yellow">Hey, who's this?</font>

108
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,965
<font color="yellow">It's the weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo.</font>

109
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,795
<font color="yellow">Are you watching me 24 hours a day?</font>

110
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:50,825
<font color="yellow">Why do we meet every day?</font>

111
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,825
<font color="yellow">I find it surprising, too.</font>

112
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,095
<font color="yellow">Why do I always see you?</font>

113
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:58,795
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

114
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:00,825
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. It's none of your business.</font>

115
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:04,295
<font color="yellow">It looks like you're coming back from a concert.</font>

116
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,525
<font color="yellow">You didn't go there...</font>

117
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,765
<font color="yellow">looking unsophisticated by wearing a dress and heels, did you?</font>

118
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:11,165
<font color="yellow">No way. I wouldn't wear such an outfit to a concert.</font>

119
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,965
<font color="yellow">I was checking just in case you did.</font>

120
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:17,065
<font color="yellow">My brother despises a fashion style that's too feminine.</font>

121
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:19,865
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

122
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,065
<font color="yellow">No, I was kidding.</font>

123
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:24,665
<font color="yellow">All men like feminine fashion style.</font>

124
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,965
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

125
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,765
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me because you saw me? You're so evil.</font>

126
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,365
<font color="yellow">Don't call me evil when I paid for you.</font>

127
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,865
<font color="yellow">Then why did you tease me?</font>

128
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,195
<font color="yellow">I spent all of my monthly allowance to buy those tickets.</font>

129
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,295
<font color="yellow">Well, thank you for the tickets.</font>

130
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,795
<font color="yellow">You should thank me.</font>

131
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,065
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good time with him?</font>

132
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,965
<font color="yellow">It wasn't bad.</font>

133
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,295
<font color="yellow">- He drove me, too.
- You went for a drive?</font>

134
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:55,825
<font color="yellow">You did everything, didn't you?</font>

135
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,695
<font color="yellow">Watch out, Bok Joo!</font>

136
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:22,125
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that was close.</font>

137
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,025
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness for my quick motor system.</font>

138
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,695
<font color="yellow">What was wrong with that driver?</font>

139
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,125
<font color="yellow">Hey, you!</font>

140
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,525
<font color="yellow">Come here, you jerk.</font>

141
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:31,865
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung!</font>

142
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,465
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

143
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,395
<font color="yellow">Why don't you rest some more?</font>

144
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,465
<font color="yellow">It's okay, I'm fine now.</font>

145
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,065
<font color="yellow">You had a temporary stomach cramp, so I gave you a shot of painkillers.</font>

146
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,225
<font color="yellow">Here's some antacid.</font>

147
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,295
<font color="yellow">Remember to take it after eating.</font>

148
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:08,925
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

149
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:12,595
<font color="yellow">Stomach cramps are usually caused by excessive acid due to stress.</font>

150

<font color="yellow">Are you stressed out these days?</font>

151
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:16,065
<font color="yellow">Yes, a little.</font>

152
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,995
<font color="yellow">Is it because of a man?</font>

153
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:21,465
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

154
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,695
<font color="yellow">Who is this man making such a beautiful woman sad?</font>

155
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:35,265
<font color="yellow">You should dry your hair first. It's all wet.</font>

156
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,265
<font color="yellow">Whose fault is that? Keep your mouth shut.</font>

157
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,895
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. It'll take forever to dry your hair like that.</font>

158
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:46,925
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

159
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,625
<font color="yellow">Wait, I'll dry it for you.</font>

160
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,565
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

161
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:00,295
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I'm sorry.</font>

162
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,365
<font color="yellow">Here, do whatever you want with it.</font>

163
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,265
<font color="yellow">I never asked you to dry my hair, you punk.</font>

164
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:20,895
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

165
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:28,065
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

166
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,965
<font color="yellow">Do you think Jae Yi noticed...</font>

167
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,295
<font color="yellow">that you like him?</font>

168
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:33,765
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think he has any idea.</font>

169
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:37,065
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to find out.</font>

170
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,165
<font color="yellow">Men don't like women who does weightlifting.</font>

171
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,365
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

172
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,395
<font color="yellow">It's full of calluses.</font>

173
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,625
<font color="yellow">Who would like hands full of calluses?</font>

174
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,265
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that? It's because you do weightlifting.</font>

175
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:50,695
<font color="yellow">You can feel safe walking at night.</font>

176
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:52,325
<font color="yellow">I'd be happy if I were him.</font>

177
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,395
<font color="yellow">You're only good with words.</font>

178
00:12:57,565 --> 00:12:59,995
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I had a good day.</font>

179
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:02,165
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I went on something similar to a date.</font>

180
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,165
<font color="yellow">When Dr. Jeong was driving me,</font>

181
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,365
<font color="yellow">I felt like Cinderella riding her pumpkin carriage.</font>

182
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,395
<font color="yellow">You know, when the clock hits midnight,</font>

183
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,765
<font color="yellow">she comes back to reality.</font>

184
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,465
<font color="yellow">At least, she ends up marrying the prince.</font>

185
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,295
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

186
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:21,125
<font color="yellow">I don't like watching movies without a happy ending.</font>

187
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,625
<font color="yellow">Did you know...</font>

188
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,395
<font color="yellow">in that fountain...</font>

189
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,525
<font color="yellow">lives a toad that grants your wishes?</font>

190
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:35,695
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You didn't know?</font>

191
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,265
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you go to Haneol Sport University? It's a famous legend.</font>

192
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,695
<font color="yellow">You know all of our senior athletes who won the gold medal?</font>

193
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,465
<font color="yellow">All of them won because of the toad.</font>

194
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,625
<font color="yellow">You should work on your creativity.</font>

195
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,095
<font color="yellow">I'm being serious.</font>

196
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,395
<font color="yellow">You may not know it,</font>

197
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:56,465
<font color="yellow">but if you pray earnestly enough, he grants your wish no matter what.</font>

198
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:57,925
<font color="yellow">Why don't you pray to him...</font>

199
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,095
<font color="yellow">so that it works out between you and Jae Yi?</font>

200
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,395
<font color="yellow">You're full of lies.</font>

201
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,625
<font color="yellow">Did you catch a cold?</font>

202
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,025
<font color="yellow">My nose has been itching for a while.</font>

203
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,965
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

204
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,125
<font color="yellow">but I have an important plan to follow, so I can't catch a cold.</font>

205
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,125
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

206
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,065
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

207
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:35,095
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I really can't catch a cold.</font>

208
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:36,965
<font color="yellow">It'll last long.</font>

209
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,825
<font color="yellow">My germs are very strong like me.</font>

210
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,295
<font color="yellow">It's an awesome virus.</font>

211
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,865
<font color="yellow">If I really catch a cold,</font>

212
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,025
<font color="yellow">I'm going to...</font>

213
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,965
<font color="yellow">return the virus by kissing you if I have to.</font>

214
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:48,965
<font color="yellow">You wait and see.</font>

215
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,565
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Joon Hyung.</font>

216
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,165
<font color="yellow">Come on, be a loyal friend.</font>

217
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,995
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung, wait for me.</font>

218
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:12,195
<font color="yellow">I must have caught a cold.</font>

219
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,795
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying.</font>

220
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:24,125
<font color="yellow">Are you sick? You look so pale.</font>

221
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,925
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

222
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,495
<font color="yellow">I also caught a cold.</font>

223
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,695
<font color="yellow">Maybe we're unlucky today.</font>

224
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,625
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't it open?</font>

225
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:33,965
<font color="yellow">Here, I'll do it for you.</font>

226
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:36,825
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. I'll do it.
- Come on, give it to me.</font>

227
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:37,825
<font color="yellow">I said I will...</font>

228
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,865
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being too sensitive.</font>

229
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,695
<font color="yellow">Even if Bok Joo moves up her weight class,</font>

230
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,195
<font color="yellow">she'll do well.</font>

231
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,595
<font color="yellow">Chang Geol, they want more radish.</font>

232
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,965
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? The chicken is getting burnt.</font>

233
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,295
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

234
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,625
<font color="yellow">It's all burnt. What a waste.</font>

235
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,695
<font color="yellow">Did you fall asleep or something?</font>

236
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,295
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

237
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,395
<font color="yellow">I was lost in thoughts.</font>

238
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:21,265
<font color="yellow">Focus on strengthening the torso while keeping the same weight.</font>

239
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,065
<font color="yellow">- Let's increase the number.
- Okay.</font>

240
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,865
<font color="yellow">Should we increase the number of consumption of protein as well?</font>

241
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,595
<font color="yellow">Let Woon Gi decide.</font>

242
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,165
<font color="yellow">He can adjust it on his own.</font>

243
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:33,095
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that Woon Gi decided to move up.</font>

244
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,365
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo doesn't seem probable though, right?</font>

245
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,825
<font color="yellow">I can't bring it up without Mr. Kim's permission.</font>

246
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,395
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard for Bok Joo to decide as well.</font>

247
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:46,825
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

248
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,125
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here.</font>

249
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,465
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call us? We would have come to you.</font>

250
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,825
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know why I'm here.</font>

251
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,965
<font color="yellow">Let's get down to it since we're both busy.</font>

252
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,395
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'm listening.</font>

253
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,195
<font color="yellow">It's about what you mentioned last time.</font>

254
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:05,925
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo's weight class.</font>

255
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,095
<font color="yellow">What do you think is going on?</font>

256
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,495
<font color="yellow">I have no idea.</font>

257
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,065
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling about it.</font>

258
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,465
<font color="yellow">I want to know.</font>

259
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:20,995
<font color="yellow">I really want to know.</font>

260
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,225
<font color="yellow">- It's driving me crazy.
- Stop it.</font>

261
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,995
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You're making it worse.</font>

262
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,795
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, come out now.</font>

263
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,865
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

264
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,525
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

265
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:32,695
<font color="yellow">My weight class?</font>

266
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,195
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

267
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:35,635
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're surprised.</font>

268
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,195
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'd be surprised if I were you.</font>

269
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:40,635
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon and I believe...</font>

270
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,635
<font color="yellow">that you have the potential.</font>

271
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:47,795
<font color="yellow">Increasing your weight few months before the competition isn't normal,</font>

272
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,965
<font color="yellow">but you're strong.</font>

273
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:53,095
<font color="yellow">Off the records, you've tied with the best record from the 63kg class.</font>

274
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,395
<font color="yellow">That's when I was in my best condition.</font>

275
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:56,635
<font color="yellow">You should make it so.</font>

276
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,295
<font color="yellow">We'll make sure to help you.</font>

277
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,425
<font color="yellow">As you know,</font>

278
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:04,165
<font color="yellow">the competition for 58kg weight class is fierce.</font>

279
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,265
<font color="yellow">In your weight class, the result of...</font>

280
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,095
<font color="yellow">the competition changes drastically depending on your condition.</font>

281
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,465
<font color="yellow">What about 63kg?</font>

282
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,525
<font color="yellow">Ever since Jang Ran Ran retired,</font>

283
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,565
<font color="yellow">there's no one who stands out.</font>

284
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:20,025
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this to pressure you,</font>

285
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,765
<font color="yellow">but if you go up to 63kg,</font>

286
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:23,765
<font color="yellow">then other girls...</font>

287
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,995
<font color="yellow">could try for a medal at 58kg.</font>

288
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:28,525
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi is right. It'll be a win-win situation for everyone.</font>

289
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:31,865
<font color="yellow">It'll benefit you and create opportunities for team members.</font>

290
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:35,065
<font color="yellow">If you can manage to gain 3 to 4kg, it'll be totally possible.</font>

291
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,395
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi is doing the same thing. We're working on his program now.</font>

292
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:40,365
<font color="yellow">If you can make up your mind,</font>

293
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,525
<font color="yellow">we can give you all the support you need.</font>

294
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,525
<font color="yellow">But I have to talk to my dad first...</font>

295
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,565
<font color="yellow">We already spoke to him. He gave us a go ahead today.</font>

296
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,595
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

297
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:51,925
<font color="yellow">My dad did?</font>

298
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,495
<font color="yellow">How can you do that without even talking to me?</font>

299
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:58,695
<font color="yellow">You fool. It's not like that was an easy decision for me.</font>

300
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,165
<font color="yellow">I was tossing and turning all night thinking about what to do.</font>

301
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,165
<font color="yellow">How can you make such an important decision by yourself?</font>

302
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,065
<font color="yellow">Do you think going up a weight class is as easy as blowing a balloon?</font>

303
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:10,895
<font color="yellow">Bulking up is a lot harder than losing weight.</font>

304
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:13,565
<font color="yellow">You must know it, too!</font>

305
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,395
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm obviously aware of it,</font>

00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:17,135
<font color="yellow">but life is a challenge in and of itself.</font>

307
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,665
<font color="yellow">As a weightlifter, you have to keep challenging yourself.</font>

308
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,825
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon is right. This will put you at an advantage.</font>

309
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,225
<font color="yellow">It's a pretty good strategy.</font>

310
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,695
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- I have to deep-fry chicken.</font>

311
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,995
<font color="yellow">I'm behind on orders. I have to go.</font>

312
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,025
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk later.
- Dad!</font>

313
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,665
<font color="yellow">You always do whatever you want! You even hung up on me!</font>

314
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,495
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Bok Joo.</font>

315
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:40,135
<font color="yellow">I know that it'll be difficult, but it's not impossible.</font>

316
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:42,295
<font color="yellow">I agree. Gaining 3 to 4kg...</font>

317
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,065
<font color="yellow">isn't that difficult for you.</font>

318
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,825
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

319
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:48,265
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is seriously driving me crazy.</font>

320
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,525
<font color="yellow">Why would you go crazy over this?</font>

321
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,965
<font color="yellow">We'll help you.</font>

322
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,095
<font color="yellow">Yes. As good friends, we'll pig out with you.</font>

323
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,295
<font color="yellow">That's not why I'm upset.</font>

324
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,925
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be now? For goodness' sake.</font>

325
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,095
<font color="yellow">Don't run! It'll make you lose weight.</font>

326
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:05,195
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo. Wait up!</font>

327
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,965
<font color="yellow">- Dad always does whatever he wants.
- Calm down.</font>

328
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,965
<font color="yellow">What? You want to go on the match hosted by Joongang Bank?</font>

329
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,495
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

330
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:20,065
<font color="yellow">It's a small match. It won't really be helpful for you.</font>

331
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,225
<font color="yellow">Just as practice.</font>

332
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:24,395
<font color="yellow">I see. You're right.</font>

333
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,695
<font color="yellow">Getting as much practice as possible will help you overcome the anxiety.</font>

334
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:28,895
<font color="yellow">I think it's a good idea.</font>

335
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:30,395
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

336
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,765
<font color="yellow">Use your guts that allowed you to reject being Tae Hoon's partner...</font>

337
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,765
<font color="yellow">to win a medal.</font>

338
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:38,695
<font color="yellow">Everyone will badmouth Ronaldo if he scores a goal at a tiny game.</font>

339
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,795
<font color="yellow">You're getting cheeky again. All right. Do it.</font>

340
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:43,195
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

341
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,695
<font color="yellow">Kim Bok Joo, that girl. She gave me her cold.</font>

342
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,065
<font color="yellow">Why did she have to give me her cold at a time like this?</font>

343
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:03,695
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chubs!</font>

344
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,295
<font color="yellow">Hey, how will you take responsibility for this?</font>

345
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,495
<font color="yellow">I caught a cold because of you!</font>

346
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,095
<font color="yellow">I have a match next week. How will you take responsibility for this?</font>

347
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,525
<font color="yellow">Shut it. My head is already pounding.</font>

348
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:24,465
<font color="yellow">Is something going on?</font>

349
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,825
<font color="yellow">I don't even know. Nothing is going my way.</font>

350
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,195
<font color="yellow">You looked happy until yesterday. What happened?</font>

351
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,865
<font color="yellow">- I have to move up a weight class.
- Weight class?</font>

352
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:37,265
<font color="yellow">My gosh, Bok Joo! Are you finally moving up to the heavyweight class?</font>

353
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:40,925
<font color="yellow">But what is the problem?</font>

354
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,225
<font color="yellow">Hey. Right now, I can't...</font>

355
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:46,365
<font color="yellow">You know that I'm in a bind now. I signed up at the clinic, too.</font>

356
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,795
<font color="yellow">Hey, that's not really an issue.</font>

357
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:51,695
<font color="yellow">I mean, you go there to see Jae Yi. Weight loss isn't your goal.</font>

358
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,795
<font color="yellow">You got to do what you have to do unless you'll quit weightlifting.</font>

359
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:57,295
<font color="yellow">That's true, but...</font>

360
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,995
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're talking as if it's so easy because it's not your problem.</font>

361
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,265
<font color="yellow">Do you think all things in life are that simple?</font>

362
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,995
<font color="yellow">Right, you probably have no idea how life really works.</font>

365
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:15,065
<font color="yellow">I was an idiot to expect advice from you.</font>

366

<font color="yellow">I'm going, you stuck-up.</font>

367
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,265
<font color="yellow">I should be the one getting mad at you!</font>

368
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,165

375
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,865
<font color="yellow">I left my practice journal here.</font>

376
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:50,325
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

377
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,325
<font color="yellow">Have you had a chance to give it some thought?</font>

378

<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

379
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,195
<font color="yellow">Oh, that.</font>

380
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,295
<font color="yellow">You'll need to start the special training now if you want to bulk up.</font>

<font color="yellow">We've already come up with the plan.</font>

382
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,925
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

383
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,395
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

384
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:21,125
<font color="yellow">I will... I'll give it a try.</font>

385
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:22,665
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

386
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:24,595
<font color="yellow">You want to give it a try? Seriously?</font>

387
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:27,695
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon, Professor Yoon!</font>

388
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,295
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo wants to give it a try. She has made up her mind.</font>

389
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:34,095
<font color="yellow">Is that right, Bok Joo? Are you serious?</font>

390
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,325
<font color="yellow">You made the right decision.</font>

391
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,995
<font color="yellow">As we told you the other day, you can certainly do it.</font>

392
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:45,695
<font color="yellow">Of course. Who would be able to do it if Bok Joo can't?</font>

393
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,795
<font color="yellow">Your dad will be so thrilled to hear this.</font>

394
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:51,265
<font color="yellow">- Then let's start today.
- All right.</font>

395
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,865
<font color="yellow">- I'll train Woon Gi.
- Okay.</font>

396
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,495
<font color="yellow">You should train Bok Joo, Coach Choi.</font>

397
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:59,495
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I must say that it'll also be a competition between us.</font>

398
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:00,865
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi, are you confident?</font>

399
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,265
<font color="yellow">Of course. You know how scary I can be as a coach.</font>

400
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:05,625
<font color="yellow">You're scary, indeed.</font>

401
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,695
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, you better watch out. She might bite you.</font>

402
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:35,765
<font color="yellow">One more round.</font>

403
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:49,625
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

404
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:53,225
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi, I really can't eat any more.</font>

405
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,695
<font color="yellow">There was so much rice.</font>

406
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,795
<font color="yellow">That's how much you usually eat.</font>

407
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,195
<font color="yellow">You got to go for another round.</font>

408
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:22,365
<font color="yellow">It was going so well. Why did you gain weight all of a sudden?</font>

409
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,395
<font color="yellow">Doctor, it's because I haven't been following the diet.</font>

410
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,895
<font color="yellow">- The scale isn't broken.
- It's my fault.</font>

411
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,995
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Your weight can fluctuate at the beginning.</font>

412
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:38,365
<font color="yellow">But I'm going to give you two different types of treatment today.</font>

413
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:40,095
<font color="yellow">Lie down.</font>

414
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:43,825
<font color="yellow">That's odd.</font>

415
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,065
<font color="yellow">Your weight went up by 1kg yesterday.</font>

416
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,195
<font color="yellow">Why did you lose 0.5kg?</font>

417
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:51,525
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bok Joo.</font>

418
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:53,695
<font color="yellow">Did you go...</font>

419
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:57,465
<font color="yellow">to the bathroom a few times today?</font>

420
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:00,065
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

421
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,295
<font color="yellow">We need to fix this. Let's go fill you up again.</font>

422
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,395
<font color="yellow">We're having an extra-large size of bossam for a snack!</font>

423
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:13,895
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, you got to try harder.</font>

424
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:16,165
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi has already gained 1.6kg.</font>

425
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:19,265
<font color="yellow">No, I still have a long way to go. I have to increase my muscle mass.</font>

426
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:20,965
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo will get there soon, too.</font>

427
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:24,665
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, eat the meat.</font>

428
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:37,895
<font color="yellow">Gosh, your cold is lasting for such a long time.</font>

429
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,065
<font color="yellow">Right, you're practically living in the pool to prepare for the match.</font>

430
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,495
<font color="yellow">Of course the cold won't go away.</font>

431
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:44,695
<font color="yellow">You can't even take any medicine.</font>

432
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:46,525
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you going on that match?</font>

433
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:49,125
<font color="yellow">Isn't that match for those who are starting out?</font>

434
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,195
<font color="yellow">You idiots.</font>

435
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:53,425
<font color="yellow">Only those who aren't competent are fussy about things like that.</font>

436
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,025
<font color="yellow">Learn from us, you fools.</font>

437
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:58,325
<font color="yellow">When I was a freshman, I was not like you guys...</font>

438
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:00,995
<font color="yellow">Shut it and just eat your food.</font>

439
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:12,165
<font color="yellow">- You guys are done, right?
- Yes.</font>

440
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,025
<font color="yellow">- We're going.
- I'm not done yet.</font>

441
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:17,125
<font color="yellow">- I'm not done. I'm still eating.
- Come on.</font>

442
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:19,795
<font color="yellow">Do you have a match coming up?</font>

443
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,225
<font color="yellow">It looks like you have a cold. Will you be okay?</font>

444
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,325
<font color="yellow">Coughing lasts for a long time when you catch a cold.</font>

445
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,495
<font color="yellow">You're really unbelievable.</font>

446
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,965
<font color="yellow">You're acting like a stalker. Is this fun for you?</font>

447
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:31,795
<font color="yellow">How could it be fun?</font>

448
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,895
<font color="yellow">It's exhausting and embarrassing. My pride has been crushed.</font>

449
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:38,695
<font color="yellow">But I'm really desperate right now.</font>

450
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:42,565
<font color="yellow">You're the only thing I can hold onto.</font>

451
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,295
<font color="yellow">That's just in your head.</font>

452
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:46,925
<font color="yellow">I'm not that person for you.</font>

453
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,695
<font color="yellow">I'm just myself.</font>

454
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:52,025
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

455
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,695
<font color="yellow">I'll leave you alone, so finish your food.</font>

456
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,395
<font color="yellow">You can't even take medicine, so you have to eat well.</font>

457
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,695
<font color="yellow">It looks like Joon Hyung keeps rejecting you.</font>

458
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,095
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too demeaning?</font>

459
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,465
<font color="yellow">You're the most beautiful girl in our school.</font>

460
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:24,165
<font color="yellow">Is this why you kept rejecting me?</font>

461
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:26,395
<font color="yellow">You can come back.</font>

462
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,125
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you better than Joon Hyung.</font>

463
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:35,365
<font color="yellow">Get lost, you jerk.</font>

464
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,165
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

465
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:45,465
<font color="yellow">- I'll never finish this. No.
- Let me go.</font>

466
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:47,225
<font color="yellow">No, no!</font>

467
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,225
<font color="yellow">Why can't you eat it?</font>

468
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,595
<font color="yellow">Just have some drumsticks...</font>

469
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,025
<font color="yellow">and drink the broth. It's not that much.</font>

470
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,595
<font color="yellow">I thought you must be sick of fried chicken.</font>

471
00:28:54,595 --> 00:28:58,225
<font color="yellow">That's why I boiled the chicken with ginseng and abalone.</font>

472
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,695
<font color="yellow">I even had three plates of food for lunch today.</font>

473
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:01,965
<font color="yellow">There's only so much I can eat.</font>

474
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:04,095
<font color="yellow">I can't just keep shoving food down my throat.</font>

475
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,995
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

476
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,665
<font color="yellow">Pick it up! Just wait.</font>

477
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:10,495
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. I know it's hard,</font>

478
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,495
<font color="yellow">but you should try your best.</font>

479
00:29:12,495 --> 00:29:14,695
<font color="yellow">I think you really have a shot at winning.</font>

480
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:16,195
<font color="yellow">I can feel it.</font>

481
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:18,825
<font color="yellow">That doesn't matter.</font>

482
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,795
<font color="yellow">I'm saying I'm not confident!</font>

483
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:23,265
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just eat it. My arms are about to fall off.</font>

484
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,525
<font color="yellow">Then put it on your head!</font>

485
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:25,795
<font color="yellow">Or on your back!</font>

486
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,625
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, you punk.</font>

487
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,165
<font color="yellow">I can't put this on my back.</font>

488
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,125
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

489
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,195
<font color="yellow">Hi, Coach Choi.</font>

490
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,825
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to go through the trouble and make this.</font>

491
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,795
<font color="yellow">I bought some pizza for Bok Joo as well.</font>

492
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,795
<font color="yellow">Is that so? Shall we go inside?</font>

493
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:40,825
<font color="yellow">- Let me carry it.
- No, it's fine.</font>

494
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:42,395
<font color="yellow">Lifting things is what I do. Let's go.</font>

495
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:43,965
<font color="yellow">Let's eat, Bok Joo.</font>

496
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:46,995
<font color="yellow">- Let me carry it.
- It's okay.</font>

497
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,095
<font color="yellow">- I can't eat any more.
- Hurry up.</font>

498
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,525
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo's dad...</font>

499
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,595
<font color="yellow">makes such delicious food.</font>

500
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,065
<font color="yellow">He is a master.</font>

501
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:05,195
<font color="yellow">- This is perfectly seasoned.
- I know.</font>

502
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:08,065
<font color="yellow">By the way, we can eat as much food as we want...</font>

503
00:30:08,295 --> 00:30:09,595
<font color="yellow">with people's support.</font>

504
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:12,265
<font color="yellow">- Weightlifting isn't so bad, right?
- That's right.</font>

505
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:15,695
<font color="yellow">Those gymnasts eat like a bird every day to lose weight.</font>

506
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:19,165
<font color="yellow">Eat up. Why are you picking at the food? This is all for you.</font>

507
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:22,025
<font color="yellow">She's right. Have some pizza.</font>

508
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,065
<font color="yellow">Should I pick some drumsticks? You like them.</font>

509
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:27,295
<font color="yellow">You said you wish chickens had four feet.</font>

510
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,165
<font color="yellow">I'm just sick of chicken.</font>

511
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:32,495
<font color="yellow">I'll soon shed chicken broth instead of tears.</font>

512
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:33,795
<font color="yellow">I'm actually full.</font>

513
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,495
<font color="yellow">We might all end up in the open-weight class.</font>

514
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:38,765
<font color="yellow">Don't be so weak.</font>

515
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,825
<font color="yellow">We, big eaters, always have...</font>

516
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:42,825
<font color="yellow">our friend, soft drinks.</font>

517
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:45,825
<font color="yellow">Help us, dear soft drinks!</font>

518
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:48,325
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I have some coins. I'll get them.</font>

519
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:50,765
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

520
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,365
<font color="yellow">(A New Message)</font>

521
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,765
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't try so hard.</font>

522
00:30:56,865 --> 00:30:58,325
<font color="yellow">You'll lose weight. I'll do it.</font>

523
00:30:58,325 --> 00:30:59,395
<font color="yellow">Let me.</font>

524
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:05,665
<font color="yellow">"Ms. Kim Bok Joo, your session is at 4:30pm tomorrow. J Weight Clinic."</font>

525
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:07,695
<font color="yellow">Your session is at 4:30 at J Weight...</font>

526
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:14,225
<font color="yellow">Hey. Why do you go to a weight clinic?</font>

527
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:15,625
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee. Let me explain.</font>

528
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,225
<font color="yellow">- Nan Hee.
- I just...</font>

529
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:23,195
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why do you go to a weight clinic?</font>

530
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,595
<font color="yellow">You need to raise your weight class.</font>

531
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:27,325
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you up to these days?</font>

532
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:29,925
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee.</font>

533
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:32,165
<font color="yellow">How could that be?</font>

534
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:41,095
<font color="yellow">Great work today.</font>

535
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,195
<font color="yellow">- Are you saying you like him?
- You, too. See you tomorrow.</font>

536
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,695
<font color="yellow">Not Joon Hyung?</font>

537
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,025
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

538
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:51,795
<font color="yellow">And he is Joon Hyung's older brother.</font>

539
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:54,195
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

540
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:56,425
<font color="yellow">You wanted...</font>

541
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,065
<font color="yellow">to see him at any cost,</font>

542
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:01,525
<font color="yellow">so you signed up for sessions and paid a lot of money.</font>

543
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,595
<font color="yellow">You lied to us, kept going there,</font>

544
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,665
<font color="yellow">and lifted the rice bags for Joon Hyung to keep him quiet.</font>

545
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,895
<font color="yellow">Is this what you're saying?</font>

546
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,125
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- You crazy girl!</font>

547
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,495
<font color="yellow">I know. I deserve that. I am crazy.</font>

548
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,325
<font color="yellow">No one in the right mind would do this.</font>

549
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:19,025
<font color="yellow">I tried hard not to do it,</font>

550
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:21,825
<font color="yellow">but he kept popping up in my head. I started seeing things.</font>

551
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,695
<font color="yellow">I really couldn't help it.</font>

552
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,695
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to see his face. That's all I wanted.</font>

553
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:30,595
<font color="yellow">I get it.</font>

554
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:34,465
<font color="yellow">I mean he's way better than Joon Hyung.</font>

555
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,925
<font color="yellow">He's so manly. He looked very sturdy.</font>

556
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:38,825
<font color="yellow">Right? Isn't he handsome?</font>

557
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:40,295
<font color="yellow">Yes, he is.</font>

558
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:43,795
<font color="yellow">He's cute. Besides, he's a doctor.</font>

559
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:46,665
<font color="yellow">You're so sly.</font>

560
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,025
<font color="yellow">You pretended that you were not interested in men at all.</font>

561
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,925
<font color="yellow">You have such a great taste in men.</font>

562
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:56,095
<font color="yellow">By the way, how did you guys meet?</font>

563
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:58,995
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be like in the movie...</font>

564
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:02,895
<font color="yellow">where he shared his umbrella on a rainy day, right?</font>

565
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:13,895
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

566
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,225
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Really?</font>

567
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,595
<font color="yellow">Did he really do that?</font>

568
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:22,695
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

569
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:24,365
<font color="yellow">He makes my heart flatter.</font>

570
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,495
<font color="yellow">He's great and handsome, right?</font>

571
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:27,425
<font color="yellow">I want someone like him, too.</font>

572
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:30,825
<font color="yellow">- He's mine.
- Is he? I'm so jealous.</font>

573
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,095
<font color="yellow">(Si Ho, it's ginger extract. Eat it when you have a cold. Mom)</font>

574
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,995
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing? Get some rest.</font>

575
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,225
<font color="yellow">You have a match tomorrow, and you're still sick.</font>

576
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:54,295
<font color="yellow">You should save your energy.</font>

577
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:55,565
<font color="yellow">I need to watch this.</font>

578
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,595
<font color="yellow">Watching it won't help you.</font>

579
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:58,795
<font color="yellow">Get rest.</font>

580
00:33:58,795 --> 00:33:59,925
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

581
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:01,825
<font color="yellow">Fine. Gosh.</font>

582
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,565
<font color="yellow">Stop nagging me. You're not my mom.</font>

583
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:05,795
<font color="yellow">Stop complaining.</font>

584
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:06,795
<font color="yellow">Just go to sleep.</font>

585
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,295
<font color="yellow">It's me, Si Ho.</font>

586
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:17,325
<font color="yellow">Can you come out without telling Joon Hyung?</font>

587
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,595
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

588
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,535
<font color="yellow">I called you out so suddenly. You must've been surprised.</font>

589
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:29,865
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

590
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,365
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

591
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,565
<font color="yellow">It's dates and ginger tea. Joon Hyung has a game tomorrow.</font>

592
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,195
<font color="yellow">If I give it to him, he won't drink it.</font>

593
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:43,995
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

594
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:48,695
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

595
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:52,535
<font color="yellow">It's my sincere love for you.</font>

596
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:57,695
<font color="yellow">Is this ginger tea?</font>

597
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,125
<font color="yellow">Don't ask any questions and just drink up.</font>

598
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,165
<font color="yellow">Think of it as medicine.</font>

599
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:11,925
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

600
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:13,825
<font color="yellow">I feel better now.</font>

601
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,965
<font color="yellow">Do you? That's good to hear.</font>

602
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,195
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

603
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:21,095
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be so cold and play nice.</font>

604
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:24,295
<font color="yellow">What I meant was your body and heart are cold.</font>

605

606

<font color="yellow">Hey, I need to go to the bathroom. I have to go.</font>

607
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:32,965
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the bathroom. Finish it before I get back.</font>

608
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,195
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

609
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:41,565
<font color="yellow">Do you know how sexy his voice is?</font>

610
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:44,265
<font color="yellow">It's not too high or too low.</font>

611
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:45,795
<font color="yellow">It sounds so sweet.</font>

612
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:49,695
<font color="yellow">It must be as great as the prince's voice that Sleeping Beauty heard...</font>

613
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:52,195
<font color="yellow">when she woke up from her sleep.</font>

614
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:55,125
<font color="yellow">Gosh, really?</font>

615
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,125
<font color="yellow">I saw his face but didn't hear his voice.</font>

616
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:00,095
<font color="yellow">When he smiles,</font>

617
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:02,095
<font color="yellow">the corners of his eyes wrinkle a bit,</font>

618
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,225
<font color="yellow">and his white teeth are shown.</font>

619
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:05,895
<font color="yellow">It makes my heart flutter.</font>

620
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,795
<font color="yellow">It feels so enchanting. He melts my heart.</font>

621
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:12,925
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you the biggest reason why I fell for him.</font>

622
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,495
<font color="yellow">This is really important.</font>

623
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:16,425
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

624
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,665
<font color="yellow">his gentle heart.</font>

625
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:22,325
<font color="yellow">I've never seen such a gentleman.</font>

626
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:25,565
<font color="yellow">He's not pretentious. It's his natural personality.</font>

627
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,695
<font color="yellow">When I'm with him,</font>

628
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:32,325
<font color="yellow">I feel like I became a very beautiful woman.</font>

629

630
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,125

631
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:44,765
<font color="yellow">He's sweet, gentle, and reliable.</font>

632
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,825
<font color="yellow">I can't believe he is Joon Hyung's brother.</font>

633
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,825
<font color="yellow">He's so mature.</font>

634
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:53,295
<font color="yellow">Hey. Listening to you makes me want to meet him.</font>

635
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:54,765
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

636
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:59,035
<font color="yellow">You're not going to make us fight over a guy, right?</font>

637
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:01,265
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit worried that you will.</font>

638
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:03,195
<font color="yellow">You flirt with every guy.</font>

639
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,225
<font color="yellow">No matter how desperate I am, I won't try to steal your man.</font>

640
00:37:08,365 --> 00:37:09,425
<font color="yellow">My man?</font>

644
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:17,765
<font color="yellow">We used the toilet, of course.</font>

645
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,295
<font color="yellow">We were about to leave. Let's go.</font>

646
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:20,365
<font color="yellow">Were you two...</font>

647
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,695
<font color="yellow">badmouthing me?</font>

648
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,665
<font color="yellow">How can you do that? You disappeared without me.</font>

649
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:29,165
<font color="yellow">Don't be absurd.</font>

650
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,625
<font color="yellow">We don't have anything bad to say about you.</font>

651
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,535
<font color="yellow">Of course. Don't be silly.</font>

652
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:35,035
<font color="yellow">Let's just go out.</font>

653
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,095
<font color="yellow">Why did you take one Hamburg steak?</font>

654
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:45,465
<font color="yellow">You should eat a lot to put on weight. Here. Take mine.</font>

655
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:49,295
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Seon Ok.</font>

656

657
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,995
<font color="yellow">The food got stuck in my throat.</font>

658
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:11,425

00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,425
<font color="yellow">Gosh, eat slowly.</font>

660
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:17,695
<font color="yellow">It finally went down.</font>

661
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:21,865
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're eating well today. Here you go.</font>

662
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,995
<font color="yellow">Have another.</font>

667
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:51,395

668
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:13,035

677
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,765

691

00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:49,765
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

944
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:51,495
