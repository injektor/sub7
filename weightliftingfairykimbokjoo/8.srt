<font color="yellow">What should I tell Dr. Jeong?</font>

3
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,653
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you up to?</font>

4
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:26,883
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep calling Joon Hyung and seeing him?</font>

5
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:28,583
<font color="yellow">I heard you like someone else.</font>

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,023
<font color="yellow">Why are you making passes at Joon Hyung?</font>

7
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,183
<font color="yellow">Making passes? What are you talking about?</font>

8
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:36,853
<font color="yellow">I left your diet journal...</font>

9
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:37,853
<font color="yellow">at the gym.</font>

10
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:39,853
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

11
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:42,553
<font color="yellow">What... What did you say?</font>

12
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:46,023
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that...</font>

13
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:48,983
<font color="yellow">you put my diet journal there on purpose?</font>

14
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,783
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm the one who did it.</font>

15
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,123
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

16
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,353
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

17
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:58,253
<font color="yellow">I was annoyed and upset that you were so close to Joon Hyung.</font>

18
00:00:58,253 --> 00:00:59,423

20

21

<font color="yellow">Didn't you know that it was a warning?</font>

22
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:10,783

23
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:12,483
<font color="yellow">You said you like someone else.</font>

24

00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,853
<font color="yellow">Hey, listen.</font>

26
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,123

<font color="yellow">I have no intention to date Joon Hyung at all!</font>

28

<font color="yellow">Besides, he doesn't find me attractive.</font>

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,383
<font color="yellow">Why would he like me when he's so popular?</font>

30
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:27,523
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

31
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,553
<font color="yellow">- was it my misunderstanding? - Yes, it was.</font>

32
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,583
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you apologize to me before bringing that up?</font>

33
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,583
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to apologize.</font>

34
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:38,053
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung hurt my feelings because of you.</font>

35
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:40,423
<font color="yellow">It was because of you, not me.</font>

36
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:43,053
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so aggressive.</font>

37
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:44,323

39
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:52,183
<font color="yellow">You're two-faced.</font>

40
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:55,653
<font color="yellow">What do you know?</font>

41
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,283
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything about my relationship with him.</font>

42
00:01:58,423 --> 00:01:59,853
<font color="yellow">You're right. I don't know.</font>

43
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,883
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested, either.</font>

44
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:02,753
<font color="yellow">Let me go. I don't want to talk to you</font>

45
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,323
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep somewhere else.</font>

46
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,683
<font color="yellow">It was serious between us.</font>

47
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:07,553
<font color="yellow">That's why Joon Hyung was hurt.</font>

48

53
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,383
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who should be angry. Let me go!</font>

00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:43,253
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok, are you going to stay upset?</font>

56
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:46,953
<font color="yellow">Like I said, I wasn't trying to bully you.</font>

57
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,653
<font color="yellow">I found out only a few days ago.</font>

58

<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

60
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,383
<font color="yellow">Why don't you sleep in your own room?</font>

61
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:04,283
<font color="yellow">I can't think clearly right now.</font>

62
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,853

157
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,423
<font color="yellow">I can see that...</font>

158
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,253
<font color="yellow">you're not so bad-looking.</font>

159
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,383
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me?</font>

160
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:44,583
<font color="yellow">No, you're pretty.</font>

161
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:47,453
<font color="yellow">No one other than my dad has said that.</font>

162
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,883
<font color="yellow">You're just not bad-looking.</font>

163
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:58,123
<font color="yellow">When I break up with someone I love</font>

164
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:03,223
<font color="yellow">The world is over</font>

165
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:05,823
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

166
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,583
<font color="yellow">When you break up with someone, the world seems to end.</font>

167
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,683
<font color="yellow">That's what love is.</font>

168
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:26,783
<font color="yellow">Once in everyone's life</font>

169
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:32,353
<font color="yellow">- You meet someone unforgettable - Coach Choi.</font>

170
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:34,053
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why didn't you go home?</font>

171
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,253
<font color="yellow">Professor Yoon.</font>

172
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:39,223
<font color="yellow">Why are you here at this hour?</font>

173
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:40,783
<font color="yellow">After a meeting,</font>

174
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:44,493
<font color="yellow">I had dinner with other professors. I'm here to pick up my car.</font>

175
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,783
<font color="yellow">I see. I was about to leave.</font>

176
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:47,783
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

177
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,153
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't believe...</font>

178
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:52,553
<font color="yellow">how much Professor Choi was bragging about his team...</font>

179
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:55,083
<font color="yellow">winning all the gold medals.</font>

180
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,423
<font color="yellow">I see. You must have been bored.</font>

181
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,053
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

182
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,723
<font color="yellow">Wait, let's go together.</font>

183
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,493
<font color="yellow">- I'll give you a ride. - It's okay.</font>

184
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:04,783
<font color="yellow">We're going the opposite directions.</font>

185
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,823
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.</font>

186
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,623
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

187
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:20,423
<font color="yellow">Why was she so sad?</font>

188
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,423
<font color="yellow">- Haneol. - Haneol.</font>

189
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,083
<font color="yellow">Why are you panting? The jog wasn't long.</font>

190
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,323
<font color="yellow">And you call yourselves athletes?</font>

191
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,753
<font color="yellow">- We ran hard. - We did.</font>

192
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,053
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

193
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,223
<font color="yellow">To prepare for next month's competition,</font>

194
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,823
<font color="yellow">you'll start the training of the highest difficulty level.</font>

195
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,453
<font color="yellow">Go inside and get warmed up.</font>

196
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:51,883
<font color="yellow">- Go. - Gosh.</font>

197
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,253
<font color="yellow">- Go in. - Are you ready?</font>

198
00:09:58,453 --> 00:09:59,493
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

199
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,053
<font color="yellow">Coach Choi.</font>

200
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,383
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

201
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,123
<font color="yellow">Don't drink alone from now on.</font>

202
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,323
<font color="yellow">If you fall into a habit, you'll become alcoholic.</font>

203
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,053
<font color="yellow">I was so tired.</font>

204
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,583
<font color="yellow">I wanted to sleep at home after two cans of beer.</font>

205
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,383
<font color="yellow">Let's drink together.</font>

206
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,383
<font color="yellow">- Are you doing anything tonight? - Excuse me?</font>

207
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,723
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

208
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:21,023
<font color="yellow">You don't want to drink with a man with a popped belly?</font>

209
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,823
<font color="yellow">I wanted to treat you.</font>

210
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,923
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'd like that.</font>

211
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:27,753
<font color="yellow">Let's go out after the training.</font>

212
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,323
<font color="yellow">The food stand I told you about makes good eel dish.</font>

213
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,323
<font color="yellow">Si Ho.</font>

214
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:44,653
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Here. It's a present.</font>

215
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:48,123
<font color="yellow">I sent the video of the competition in Moscow to your email.</font>

216
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,353
<font color="yellow">Watch it carefully.</font>

217
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,523
<font color="yellow">It will help you a lot for the competition.</font>

218
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:54,383
<font color="yellow">- Keep it up. - Thank you.</font>

219
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,323
<font color="yellow">- Isn't Coach Seong sly? - Why?</font>

220
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,083
<font color="yellow">After the competition, she treats Si Ho so differently.</font>

221
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,083
<font color="yellow">I guess her affection towards Si Ho came back.</font>

222
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,823
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Soo Bin was her favorite for a while.</font>

223
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,053
<font color="yellow">It won't last long.</font>

224
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:11,853
<font color="yellow">Even if you glue back a broken bowl, it will break again soon.</font>

225
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,453
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Mom answering her phone?</font>

226
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,053
<font color="yellow">- Si Eon. - Si Ho.</font>

227
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,983
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - Si Ho.</font>

228
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,883
<font color="yellow">- What is it? Is something wrong? - I think Mom and Dad are...</font>

229
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:37,723
<font color="yellow">getting divorced.</font>

230
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:42,323
<font color="yellow">- What? - They have been fighting a lot.</font>

231
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,483
<font color="yellow">Dad doesn't come home any more.</font>

232
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,223
<font color="yellow">I think they're really getting divorced this time.</font>

233
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,423
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Si Eon.</font>

234
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:55,523
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Don't cry. It's going to be okay.</font>

235
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:59,083
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it. It's okay. Don't cry.</font>

236
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,623
<font color="yellow">Si Eon told you after all. I told her not to tell you.</font>

237
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:08,783
<font color="yellow">If she hadn't told me, when were you going to tell me?</font>

238
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,583
<font color="yellow">After you sign the divorce papers?</font>

239
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:14,423
<font color="yellow">Or when you and Dad meet someone else and get married again?</font>

240
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,953
<font color="yellow">Were you going to keep this secret from me forever?</font>

241
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:20,023
<font color="yellow">Don't raise your voice.</font>

242
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:21,923
<font color="yellow">People will recognize you.</font>

243
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,023
<font color="yellow">That doesn't matter right now.</font>

244
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,783
<font color="yellow">I heard you sold our house,</font>

245
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,583
<font color="yellow">and Dad has been a credit delinquent for a while now.</font>

246
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,683
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Don't worry about it.</font>

247
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,953
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about our divorce, either.</font>

248
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:36,653
<font color="yellow">Just focus on your training.</font>

249
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,353
<font color="yellow">How can I not worry? You're my parents.</font>

250
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:41,753
<font color="yellow">- Si Ho. - I'll quit gymnastics.</font>

251
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:43,453
<font color="yellow">I'll work and make money instead.</font>

252
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:46,983
<font color="yellow">Who says you can? Who says you can quit gymnastics?</font>

253
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,023
<font color="yellow">Do you think your life is just your own?</font>

254
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:52,423
<font color="yellow">Wrong. Your life is a part of my life, too.</font>

255
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:55,083
<font color="yellow">People point their finger at me and say I exploit my daughter.</font>

256
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:58,753
<font color="yellow">I've been fighting with your dd every day...</font>

257
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:00,223
<font color="yellow">and taking all the blame from Si Eon. What will you do with that?</font>

258
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,623
<font color="yellow">That has burdened me the most.</font>

259
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,253
<font color="yellow">The fact that my life is also your life.</font>

260
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,923
<font color="yellow">Why are you being greedy over my life?</font>

261
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,953
<font color="yellow">You should have lived your own life better.</font>

262
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,983
<font color="yellow">Why did you have me and put me through all this?</font>

263
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:28,923
<font color="yellow">Si Ho.</font>

264
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:39,883
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why would you come home at night and ask me to cook curry?</font>

265
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:42,923
<font color="yellow">Come on. I suddenly missed the curry you make.</font>

266
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,723
<font color="yellow">Great. I won't be able to marry anyone...</font>

267
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,653
<font color="yellow">because no one makes curry better than you.</font>

268
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,353
<font color="yellow">This is your mom's trick.</font>

269
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,023
<font color="yellow">I'm also a victim.</font>

270
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:58,023
<font color="yellow">You should have married a cook, then.</font>

271
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,953
<font color="yellow">Why did you choose a pharmacist?</font>

272
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:04,283
<font color="yellow">Hey. I made a slip of the tongue, didn't I?</font>

273
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,823
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think so.</font>

274
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:09,923
<font color="yellow">Here she comes.</font>

275
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,253
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so annoying. Why are you in my seat?</font>

276
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,623
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. I was only joking.</font>

277
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:19,583
<font color="yellow">Where's my curry?</font>

278
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:21,953
<font color="yellow">You have abdominal obesity.</font>

279
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,283
<font color="yellow">You're the one who has abdominal obesity.</font>

280
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,383
<font color="yellow">I deserve to eat the dishes I made.</font>

281
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:31,123
<font color="yellow">- I should just keep eating. - Eat up, dear.</font>

282
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,283
<font color="yellow">I'll get straight to the result.</font>

283
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,953
<font color="yellow">- I messed up. - Why?</font>

284
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,983
<font color="yellow">When I tried to control my mind through the breathing,</font>

285
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,483
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be okay.</font>

286
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:00,083
<font color="yellow">I need a refund for the counseling fee.</font>

287
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:03,223
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I can't do that. I should make a living, too.</font>

288
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,983
<font color="yellow">Listen. I'll buy you a meal. Don't tell anyone about this.</font>

289
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,083
<font color="yellow">Why don't we...</font>

290
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,153
<font color="yellow">think of it as a warm-up exercise,</font>

291
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,523
<font color="yellow">and take it slow to solve it?</font>

292
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,083
<font color="yellow">I'm sure we'll be able to find a good solution.</font>

293
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,983
<font color="yellow">If we can't solve it by this year, I'll be doomed. I'm getting old.</font>

294
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:25,023
<font color="yellow">That's true. You should be soaring high at this age.</font>

295
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,583
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Be happy.</font>

296
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,183
<font color="yellow">By the way, it's about your mother.</font>

297
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,053
<font color="yellow">Not the mother you have now, but your birth mother.</font>

298
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,123
<font color="yellow">Didn't you want to look for her?</font>

299
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:45,683
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

300
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:47,383
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

301
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:48,553
<font color="yellow">Why? You must have been curious.</font>

302
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,323
<font color="yellow">She must have reasons for severing contact with me.</font>

303
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,353
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

304
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,083
<font color="yellow">Also, I guess I felt bad...</font>

305
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,453
<font color="yellow">for my aunt and uncle.</font>

306
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,583
<font color="yellow">Did you think it'd be betraying them?</font>

307
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:07,153
<font color="yellow">My aunt raised me with her sincere heart.</font>

308
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,083
<font color="yellow">Right. I think I know what you mean.</font>

309
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,653
<font color="yellow">But I hope...</font>

310
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,753
<font color="yellow">you will confront that matter squarely.</font>

311
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:21,683
<font color="yellow">I mean your resentment towards your mother,</font>

312
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:23,783
<font color="yellow">and your complicated emotions...</font>

313
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,353
<font color="yellow">towards your uncle's family. Such as gratitude, guilt,</font>

314
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:30,283
<font color="yellow">or tiredness from pretending you don't know the truth.</font>

315
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,353
<font color="yellow">Those emotions should burst out at least once.</font>

316
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:36,283
<font color="yellow">Only then you'll be completely free from...</font>

317
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:38,323
<font color="yellow">the trauma you're having.</font>

318
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:39,753
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

319
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,153
<font color="yellow">I should really call Dr. Jeong.</font>

320
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:58,883
<font color="yellow">Come on, Seon Ok.</font>

321
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:01,323
<font color="yellow">I bought this for you. Please eat this sausage.</font>

322
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,453
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't want to.</font>

323
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,693
<font color="yellow">Can you move? I know I'm a non-person,</font>

324
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,953
<font color="yellow">but this is still my bed.</font>

325
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,483
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok. Can you stop, please?</font>

326
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:24,483
<font color="yellow">I know you're hurt, but we didn't bully you on purpose.</font>

327
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:25,623
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

328
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,723
<font color="yellow">You didn't mean to hurt my feelings,</font>

329
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:30,423
<font color="yellow">but I'm being a crybaby.</font>

330
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,253
<font color="yellow">- That's not what I meant. - No.</font>

331
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,153
<font color="yellow">It's all because I'm small-minded.</font>

332
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:37,053
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry for not being understandable,</font>

333
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,483
<font color="yellow">and not having the personality that satisfies you.</font>

334
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,223
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are you going to keep talking like that?</font>

335
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,553
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Don't raise your voice.</font>

336
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:45,823
<font color="yellow">I'm scared you might start fighting.</font>

337
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,753
<font color="yellow">She keeps being sarcastic.</font>

338
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,453
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed in you, too.</font>

339
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:52,453
<font color="yellow">Are you getting mad at me now, Bok Joo?</font>

340
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,823
<font color="yellow">I'm sad enough as it is. Do you really have to do this?</font>

341
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,523
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting angry at others for your own mistake?</font>

342
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,423
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is fun for me?</font>

343
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,423
<font color="yellow">So just stop it already!</font>

344
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,423
<font color="yellow">I tried to, but I just can't.</font>

345
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,453
<font color="yellow">You're too loud! Fight outside!</font>

346
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:08,553
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Do you want the housemistress to kick us out?</font>

347
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,023
<font color="yellow">Have you guys thought about how I feel?</font>

348
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,753
<font color="yellow">After I came to Seoul...</font>

349
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,823
<font color="yellow">and started school, I considered you as my sisters.</font>

350
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,823
<font color="yellow">But I was deluding myself.</font>

351
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:28,623
<font color="yellow">Don't overreact over one incident. We all feel the same way.</font>

352
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,453
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo only told me...</font>

353
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:33,623
<font color="yellow">because I saw her text message. She had no choice.</font>

354
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:36,553
<font color="yellow">You should have told me when she got caught by Coach Choi.</font>

355
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:38,523
<font color="yellow">You pretended that you knew nothing,</font>

356
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:41,223
<font color="yellow">and told me we should wait because it must be hard for Bok Joo.</font>

357
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,853
<font color="yellow">You made me sound like a bad friend.</font>

358
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:46,223
<font color="yellow">That's not Nan Hee's fault. I asked her to keep it a secret.</font>

359
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:48,323
<font color="yellow">So why did you make a secret in the first place?</font>

360
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:49,483
<font color="yellow">Do you think I wanted to?</font>

361
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,883
<font color="yellow">It was hard for me to keep it a secret, too.</font>

362
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,783
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you all about it so badly.</font>

363
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:56,353
<font color="yellow">But how could I?</font>

364
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,453
<font color="yellow">I knew that I was doing something ridiculous.</font>

365
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:02,253
<font color="yellow">You're my friends, but I knew you'd hate it.</font>

366
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,883
<font color="yellow">How could I tell you? It's embarrassing.</font>

367
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:06,223
<font color="yellow">Why is it embarrassing? We're friends.</font>

368
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,453
<font color="yellow">If you told us, we'd understand. That's what friends are for.</font>

369
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,153
<font color="yellow">Is that all we mean to you?</font>

370
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,423
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok is right about that.</font>

371
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:15,583
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

372
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,223
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be disappointed and think I'm pathetic.</font>

373
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,693
<font color="yellow">No. I'm sorry. Why are you crying?</font>

374
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:25,353
<font color="yellow">It must have been so hard for you. I feel terrible.</font>

375
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,853
<font color="yellow">Guys.</font>

376
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:30,623
<font color="yellow">I won't keep anything secret from you again.</font>

377
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:31,783
<font color="yellow">I promise.</font>

378
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,423
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. You're making us feel bad.</font>

379
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,883
<font color="yellow">I told you that my parents run a store.</font>

380
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:42,583
<font color="yellow">It's not a store.</font>

381
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,783
<font color="yellow">It's a motel. I couldn't tell you because it's embarrassing.</font>

382
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:50,053
<font color="yellow">Hey. There's nothing wrong with that. Why did you hide it?</font>

383
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,483
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know...</font>

384
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,693
<font color="yellow">how it feels to serve drinks and wet towels to customers at our age.</font>

385
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,153
<font color="yellow">I'm no better.</font>

386
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,783
<font color="yellow">I haven't kissed any guy, let alone have a deep kiss.</font>

387
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:08,423
<font color="yellow">- That doesn't matter. - That's right.</font>

388
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,783
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter at all!</font>

389
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,253
<font color="yellow">- Not at all! - You can kiss someone later.</font>

390
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,623
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

391
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:24,323
<font color="yellow">I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings.</font>

392
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,553
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

393
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:28,193
<font color="yellow">made up an excuse, but things got...</font>

394
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,083
<font color="yellow">- out of hand. - Bok Joo.</font>

395
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:31,753
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

396
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,653
<font color="yellow">Slow down. You'll have indigestion again.</font>

397
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:42,083
<font color="yellow">Well, I've had enteritis, but I've never had indigestion.</font>

398
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,883
<font color="yellow">- What is indigestion? Awesome. - Awesome.</font>

399
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:48,053
<font color="yellow">Saying "awesome" with you guys just feels right.</font>

400
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,423
<font color="yellow">- You want fried rice, right? - Of course.</font>

401
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:52,693
<font color="yellow">- 2 bowls? - I'm hungry. Let's get 3.</font>

402
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:55,453
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, we'd like three bowls of rice to make fried rice!</font>

403
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,693
<font color="yellow">Hey, the weekend starts tomorrow.</font>

404
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,383
<font color="yellow">Shall we party it up today?</font>

405
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,783
<font color="yellow">- What do you think? - What will you do to us this time?</font>

406
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,583
<font color="yellow">Plus, Bok Joo has special training.</font>

407
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:08,023
<font color="yellow">Right. You won't get any rest days for the next little while, right?</font>

408
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:10,853
<font color="yellow">Both Coach Choi and Professor Yoon aren't taking any days off either,</font>

409
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,923
<font color="yellow">so I should do my best.</font>

410
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,423
<font color="yellow">That's too bad.</font>

411
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:16,553
<font color="yellow">Then how about going to karaoke room?</font>

412
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,923
<font color="yellow">I know that you are super stressed out because of Si Ho.</font>

413
00:21:19,923 --> 00:21:21,023
<font color="yellow">That's right, Song Si Ho.</font>

414
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,853
<font color="yellow">I was trying to pretend I don't know anything,</font>

415
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:25,283
<font color="yellow">- but I want to go teach that fox... - Hey, don't.</font>

416
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,583
<font color="yellow">You don't need to put that dirty blood on your hands.</font>

417
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,483
<font color="yellow">Let's just eat this and go to a karaoke room.</font>

418
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:33,193
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for the karaoke room!</font>

419
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,653
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

420
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,953
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - So? Shall we have dinner first?</font>

421
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,283
<font color="yellow">- Or shall we just go for drinks? - Let's go for drinks.</font>

422
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,753
<font color="yellow">We won't have room for drinks if we have dinner first.</font>

423
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:54,923
<font color="yellow">How much are you planning on drinking?</font>

424
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:56,453
<font color="yellow">You're scaring me.</font>

425
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,483
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be honest with you.</font>

426
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,283
<font color="yellow">I'm a lightweight compared to you.</font>

427
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:01,883
<font color="yellow">No, don't say that.</font>

428
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:05,083
<font color="yellow">I don't get drunk quickly only because I try to stay alert.</font>

429
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:09,023
<font color="yellow">It sounds like you're implying that you'll let yourself go today.</font>

430
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,053
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm terrified.</font>

431
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,253
<font color="yellow">Goodness. That's not what I meant.</font>

432
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,553
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what kind of person do you think I am...</font>

433
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:16,983
<font color="yellow">Hey, Honey.</font>

434
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,953
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

435
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:22,583
<font color="yellow">I told you not to drive at night.</font>

436
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,783
<font color="yellow">You're not an experienced driver.</font>

437
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:25,723
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

438
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:28,753
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be there shortly.</font>

439
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:30,583
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

440
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:32,583
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

441
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,423
<font color="yellow">- Was that your wife? - Yes. She got into an accident.</font>

442
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:41,723
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I think I should go see her right away.</font>

443
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,623
<font color="yellow">- Is she seriously injured? - No, she's not.</font>

444
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:47,383
<font color="yellow">I think it scared her. She gets scared easily.</font>

445
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:52,353
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I really wanted to treat you today.</font>

446
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,753
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You should get going.</font>

447
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:56,283
<font color="yellow">Yes, I better go.</font>

448
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:58,253
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you something delicious next time, okay?</font>

449
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:01,253
<font color="yellow">- Hold on, where is my car key? - In your hand.</font>

450
00:23:01,753 --> 00:23:03,483
<font color="yellow">Right. See you.</font>

451
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,053
<font color="yellow">Drive safely.</font>

452
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:09,553
<font color="yellow">Do I just like him as a person?</font>

453
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,853
<font color="yellow">Or do I still have feelings for him?</font>

454
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:21,153
<font color="yellow">Although it was love</font>

455
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:28,923
<font color="yellow">Even though I loved you</font>

456
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,823
<font color="yellow">- Just like this - Just like this</font>

457
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:36,483
<font color="yellow">- I look at you from afar - I look at you from afar</font>

458
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:41,153
<font color="yellow">- And cannot get closer to you - And cannot get closer to you</font>

459
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:56,123
<font color="yellow">- Nan Hee! - I didn't want it to be true</font>

460
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,583
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to let you go</font>

461
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:05,323
<font color="yellow">What if things go wrong and our love ends</font>

462
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:11,653
<font color="yellow">My heart aches, but I have to ignore the pain</font>

463
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:17,823
<font color="yellow">Because it'll be more painful than the breakup</font>

464
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,483
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3, 4!</font>

465
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:22,753
<font color="yellow">- I can't believe that you left me - I can't believe that you left me</font>

466
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,083
<font color="yellow">- I can't believe you abandoned me - I can't believe you abandoned me</font>

467
00:24:26,153 --> 00:24:29,453
<font color="yellow">- I cannot forget our love - I cannot forget our love</font>

468
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:32,653
<font color="yellow">- It's too late, I'm already yours - It's too late, I'm already yours</font>

469
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:34,023
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

470
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:37,983
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee, how can you get the dance move wrong every single time?</font>

471
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:41,653
<font color="yellow">- Start from the left side! - This is my signature body wave.</font>

472
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,683
<font color="yellow">Your signature body wave? Whatever.</font>

473
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,353
<font color="yellow">- Nan Hee... - Speaking of which, I was...</font>

474
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,083
<font color="yellow">so impressed by Bok Joo's vibrato.</font>

475
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,223
<font color="yellow">Hey, hasn't my vibrato gotten better?</font>

476
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,423
<font color="yellow">Seon Ok, how about my sexy body wave?</font>

477
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:54,453
<font color="yellow">- That's enough. - Stop talking about that.</font>

478
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:57,023
<font color="yellow">Let's focus on my vibrato, Nan Hee.</font>

479
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,783
<font color="yellow">Wait, girls. I think we only have two minutes.</font>

480
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,923
<font color="yellow">- My gosh! - No! I have to do my sexy dance.</font>

481
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:03,853
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, please give us bonus time. It's almost up.</font>

482
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,653
<font color="yellow">I already gave you girls additional 10 minutes.</font>

483
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,953
<font color="yellow">We come here all the time, you know.</font>

484
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:11,353
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second. What have you been doing to your skin?</font>

485
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,723
<font color="yellow">It's glowing. For a second, I thought you were my age.</font>

486
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:16,223
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll give you additional 15 minutes. Are we good now?</font>

487
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,453
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you rock.</font>

488
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,153
<font color="yellow">Tell your dad that I said hi.</font>

489
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:22,453
<font color="yellow">He hasn't been bringing leftover chicken lately.</font>

490
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,153
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

491
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:27,683
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is he doing? I should have a word with him.</font>

492
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:28,753
<font color="yellow">Go talk to him.</font>

493
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:32,753
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Let's go, let's run</font>

494
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,123
<font color="yellow">Mission accomplished!</font>

495
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,983
<font color="yellow">Make some noise!</font>

496
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,683
<font color="yellow">Fantastic baby</font>

497
00:25:46,953 --> 00:25:48,583
<font color="yellow">Fantastic baby</font>

498
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,853
<font color="yellow">Dance, dance, dance</font>

499
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,383
<font color="yellow">- Yes, we like to party - We like to party</font>

500
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,223
<font color="yellow">- We're going to party - We're going to party</font>

501
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:03,223
<font color="yellow">Open your heart, clear your head, bring on the fire</font>

502
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,853
<font color="yellow">Who says you can quit gymnastics?</font>

503
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,623
<font color="yellow">Do you think your life is just your own?</font>

504
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,053
<font color="yellow">Wrong. Your life is a part of my life, too.</font>

505
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:35,483
<font color="yellow">I've been fighting with your dad every day...</font>

506
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:39,253
<font color="yellow">and taking all the blame from Si Eon. What will you do with that?</font>

507
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:48,623
<font color="yellow">- Hello! - Yes, hello.</font>

508
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,523
<font color="yellow">Why did you come alone?</font>

509
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:55,753
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it? Am I not allowed to come here alone?</font>

510
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:57,423
<font color="yellow">Do I always have to bring people?</font>

511
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:00,283
<font color="yellow">It looks like you've already had a drink or two.</font>

512
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:03,383
<font color="yellow">I'll get pupa soup and a bottle of soju.</font>

513
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:04,923
<font color="yellow">Sure!</font>

514
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:12,953
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

515
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:18,353
<font color="yellow">You look a little different today.</font>

516
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:21,883
<font color="yellow">- This is... - My goodness!</font>

517
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,523
<font color="yellow">Your makeup isn't sitting right.</font>

518
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:26,853
<font color="yellow">I bet your date stood you up. Aren't I right?</font>

519
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:28,883
<font color="yellow">Gosh! I can't believe this.</font>

520
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:31,883
<font color="yellow">Aren't I getting my pupa soup?</font>

521
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,053
<font color="yellow">I just put it on the stove. I have to heat it up first.</font>

522
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,153
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why does this taste like it's burnt?</font>

523
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:41,623
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

524
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:43,953
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting down?</font>

525
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,253
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm sitting on our lap. This is my chair.</font>

526
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:50,023
<font color="yellow">I felt bad that you're drinking solo and wanted to keep you company...</font>

527
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,153
<font color="yellow">Are you normally that twisted?</font>

528
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:55,323
<font color="yellow">Are you normally that nosy?</font>

529
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,453
<font color="yellow">Look at that. You always have to win, don't you?</font>

530
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:04,483
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much, seriously.</font>

531
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,623
<font color="yellow">I usually drink until I drop.</font>

532
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,423
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

533
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,483
<font color="yellow">You probably can't even take a lot of alcohol.</font>

534
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,053
<font color="yellow">Gosh, snot came out of my nose.</font>

535
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:51,583
<font color="yellow">My head is splitting.</font>

536
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:03,953
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

537
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:21,323
<font color="yellow">It's Bok Joo.</font>

538
00:29:26,983 --> 00:29:28,023
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

539
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:35,183
<font color="yellow">You woke up, Coach Choi.</font>

540
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:36,983
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry, Chang Geol.</font>

541
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:40,283
<font color="yellow">- I'm so sorry. - Don't worry about it.</font>

542
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:43,453
<font color="yellow">You can certainly stay over at my place when you're drunk.</font>

543
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:44,683
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

544
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,783
<font color="yellow">I'm making beansprout soup for your hangover.</font>

545
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,153
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. I'm being a huge nuisance to you.</font>

546
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,483
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going. - What are you talking about?</font>

547
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:53,753
<font color="yellow">I got up early to make this soup for you.</font>

548
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,483
<font color="yellow">Just have a seat.</font>

549
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,983
<font color="yellow">You woke up.</font>

550
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:11,623
<font color="yellow">Have a seat. You should have this soup, too. Sit down.</font>

551
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:14,983
<font color="yellow">Yes. I should eat it for my hangover.</font>

552
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,053
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

553
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,083
<font color="yellow">Did I make any mistake last night?</font>

554
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,623
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

555
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:33,353
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

556
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,583
<font color="yellow">I also blacked out in the middle of drinking with you, so...</font>

557
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,823
<font color="yellow">Why does the soup taste like soju?</font>

558
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,683
<font color="yellow">- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

559
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,083
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

560
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,483
<font color="yellow">- Ouch. - Gosh.</font>

561
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:58,923
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

562
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,453
<font color="yellow">- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

563
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:11,823
<font color="yellow">Coach?</font>

564
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,153
<font color="yellow">Coach...</font>

565
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:21,323
<font color="yellow">I had lost my mind.</font>

566
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:24,453
<font color="yellow">How could I fall asleep there?</font>

567
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:27,083
<font color="yellow">What an embarrassment.</font>

568
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:31,423
<font color="yellow">- Coach Choi. - That startled me.</font>

569
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,853
<font color="yellow">You're wearing the same clothes. Didn't you go home last night?</font>

570
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,883
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

571
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,483
<font color="yellow">I like this outfit, so I have several of it.</font>

572
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,253
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's that nice.</font>

573
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,283
<font color="yellow">(Weight)</font>

574
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:52,823
<font color="yellow">45kg. You made the cut.</font>

575
00:31:56,823 --> 00:31:59,883
<font color="yellow">It's impossible for everyone to make the cut.</font>

576
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:03,223
<font color="yellow">The scale can't be wrong.</font>

577
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,323
<font color="yellow">My dear scale.</font>

578
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,123
<font color="yellow">Here's what was inside.</font>

579
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,953
<font color="yellow">I knew it. What is this?</font>

580
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,483
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't find out?</font>

581
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:19,523
<font color="yellow">Who's the perpetrator?</font>

582
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:23,383
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to tell me?</font>

583
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,923
<font color="yellow">Fine, starting tomorrow,</font>

584
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,983
<font color="yellow">we'll use an accurate electronic scale.</font>

585
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:47,883
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? That's not enough to break it.</font>

586
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:49,453
<font color="yellow">Move out of the way.</font>

587
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,553
<font color="yellow">Break, break.</font>

588
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:58,523
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, you startled me. - Goodness.</font>

589
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:01,483
<font color="yellow">Did I startle you? It's just me.</font>

590
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:08,853
<font color="yellow">Why are you here at this hour?</font>

591
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,623
<font color="yellow">I wanted to practice.</font>

592
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,983
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, don't stick out your bottom.</font>

593
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:16,183
<font color="yellow">Keep it engaged.</font>

594
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,153
<font color="yellow">You have to engage your legs more.</font>

595
00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:21,883
<font color="yellow">Why did you place your arm there? Let's try it again.</font>

596
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,253
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Let's see.</font>

597
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,253
<font color="yellow">Okay, keep it there.</font>

598
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,523
<font color="yellow">That's right. Great.</font>

599
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:34,183
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

600
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,783
<font color="yellow">I'm here, Professor Yoon and Coach Choi.</font>

601
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:39,083
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello, Sir.</font>

602
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,523
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you can't take your weekend off because of Bok Joo.</font>

603
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:47,053
<font color="yellow">I brought a lot for you to keep for a while.</font>

604
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,223

00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,353
<font color="yellow">You were the only person who came to my mind.</font>

759
00:43:57,753 --> 00:43:59,883
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be going home instead of the dormitory?</font>

760
00:44:00,823 --> 00:44:02,483
<font color="yellow">My parents are getting divorced.</font>

761
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:05,023
<font color="yellow">It'll be a complete mess there.</font>

762
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:08,423
<font color="yellow">If I go home,</font>

763
00:44:09,123 --> 00:44:10,383
<font color="yellow">I'll feel sick again.</font>

764
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:13,923
<font color="yellow">I didn't know,</font>

765
00:44:15,323 --> 00:44:16,723
<font color="yellow">but we'll lose our house, too.</font>

766
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:18,783
<font color="yellow">We couldn't pay back the loan.</font>

767
00:44:20,683 --> 00:44:22,623
<font color="yellow">Just so that I can pursue gymnastics,</font>

768
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:26,083
<font color="yellow">my family has been making too many sacrifices.</font>

769
00:44:27,453 --> 00:44:28,983

770

771

772
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,923

773
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:45,523
<font color="yellow">I was too young back then,</font>

774
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:49,183
<font color="yellow">and I can't quit now.</font>

775
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:52,823

776
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:14,223

777
00:45:15,823 --> 00:45:16,853
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

778
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:30,383
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't get better.</font>

779
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:34,153
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to have you looking after me.</font>

780
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:36,823
<font color="yellow">Hey. You can go alone from here, right?</font>

781
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:38,053
<font color="yellow">I have to meet someone.</font>

782
00:45:38,053 --> 00:45:39,783
<font color="yellow">Can you stay with me for a little longer?</font>

783
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:40,923
<font color="yellow">I have to go. I'm late.</font>

784

<font color="yellow">Don't forget to take your medicine.</font>

785
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:54,823
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

786
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,523
<font color="yellow">How dare you stand me up?</font>

787
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,083

788
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,883
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're such a jerk</font>

789
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,153

792
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,323
<font color="yellow">Hey, you need a serious lesson.</font>

793
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:08,883
<font color="yellow">You're honestly so full of it.</font>

794
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:10,853
<font color="yellow">What? You'll take me to the movies? You'll treat me?</font>

795
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,723

796

<font color="yellow">Nice, Stage Three. Okay.</font>

799
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:21,983
<font color="yellow">The customer you're calling is not available at the moment.</font>

800
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:25,053
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is she not picking up?</font>

801
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,683
<font color="yellow">Did she leave already?</font>

802
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:31,153
<font color="yellow">Goodness, she'll kill me.</font>

803
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:32,883
<font color="yellow">Die! Get a taste of this!</font>

804
00:46:32,883 --> 00:46:34,723

813
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:57,523
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

814
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,053

<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm sorry.</font>

818

<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry. Forgive me, please?</font>

819
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:11,553
<font color="yellow">You're really sorry, yet you can't tell me why you stood me up?</font>

820

<font color="yellow">I want to punch you so badly.</font>

821
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:15,553
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. Just punch me!</font>

822

824

825
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:28,553
<font color="yellow">Hey. You punched me once, so you'll forgive me, right?</font>

826
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:30,053
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you to something delicious.</font>

827
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,553
<font color="yellow">You like barbecue, right? How about we go for barbecue?</font>

828
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:34,883
<font color="yellow">You have to treat me. Were you going to just call it a night?</font>

829
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:37,253
<font color="yellow">Okay! Let's go, Chubs.</font>

830
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:39,523
<font color="yellow">Pork isn't good enough for today.</font>

831

833
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:45,153

835
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:55,523
<font color="yellow">I didn't even eat much.</font>

836

837
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:01,223
<font color="yellow">Hey, you'll hurt yourself.</font>

838
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,123
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Thanks.</font>

839

840

<font color="yellow">Gosh, your boyfriend is so sweet.</font>

841
00:48:10,883 --> 00:48:12,853
<font color="yellow">- Good for you. - He's not my boyfriend.</font>

842
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:13,953
<font color="yellow">Then is he your husband?</font>

843
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:16,523
<font color="yellow">You must've gotten married early. You two look so young.</font>

844
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:18,853

845

<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to eat more?</font>

846
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:22,783
<font color="yellow">Yes, this one. I'm not done yet.</font>

847
00:48:24,223 --> 00:48:25,783
<font color="yellow">All right. Eat up.</font>

848

849
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:31,053

850
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,323
<font color="yellow">I'd like a corn dog, as well.</font>

851
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:35,253
<font color="yellow">This is so good. I'll eat one more of this.</font>

852
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,383
<font color="yellow">How can you devour everything at the fishcake place...</font>

853
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,583
<font color="yellow">and still eat four servings of meat?</font>

<font color="yellow">You're seriously unbelievable.</font>

856
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:52,623
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thanks for the food, Joon Hyung.</font>

857

00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:09,383
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. That was 80 percent success.</font>

909
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:12,253
<font color="yellow">Can you make it 90 percent right away? You can take a break first.</font>

910
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:15,723
<font color="yellow">- I can do it. - Way to go, Bok Joo.</font>

911
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:18,183
<font color="yellow">I think Bok Joo will break the record today.</font>

912
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:19,523
<font color="yellow">If she can...</font>

913
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:23,853
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

914
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:26,153
<font color="yellow">- Let's go! - Go, Bok Joo!</font>

915
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:27,223
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

916
00:52:27,923 --> 00:52:30,823
<font color="yellow">Get ready. Flex your back, and watch your front leg.</font>

917
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,053
<font color="yellow">Take a deep breath.</font>

918
00:52:43,383 --> 00:52:45,283
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay? - What's wrong? Is it your back?</font>

919
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,423
<font color="yellow">I think the muscles are cramped up a bit. It's okay.</font>

920
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:51,953
<font color="yellow">You don't seem okay. Go to the infirmary.</font>

921
00:52:52,123 --> 00:52:55,253
<font color="yellow">You don't want to let it get worse. Coach Choi, call the infirmary.</font>

922
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:58,423
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Massage her back. - Yes. Here.</font>

923
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:00,283
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

924
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:02,553
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I should fix it quickly.</font>

925
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:09,023
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chubs!</font>

926
00:53:12,653 --> 00:53:13,753
<font color="yellow">Chubs.</font>

927
00:53:16,423 --> 00:53:17,483
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

928
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:20,753
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the infirmary. Don't mind me and go.</font>

929
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:23,253
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt while training?</font>

930
00:53:24,223 --> 00:53:25,283
<font color="yellow">You should have been careful.</font>

931
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:29,283
<font color="yellow">What about you? Where are you going?</font>

932
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,423
<font color="yellow">To give my brother... Gosh. I'm just going out.</font>

933
00:53:33,383 --> 00:53:35,123
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll see you later.</font>

934
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:37,423
<font color="yellow">Get a good massage.</font>

935
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:40,853
<font color="yellow">If you mention my name to Ms. Go, she will treat you better.</font>

936
00:53:41,683 --> 00:53:42,983
<font color="yellow">Look at that. Gosh.</font>

937
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,583
<font color="yellow">It looks like she's not badly hurt.</font>

938
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,983
<font color="yellow">I almost said I was going out to give Jae Yi a birthday present.</font>

939
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:52,223
<font color="yellow">I should watch my words.</font>

940
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:09,823
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I should place it where everyone can see it.</font>

941
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:16,983
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

942
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:26,623
<font color="yellow">- Joon Hyung. I brought you a drink. - Thank you.</font>

943
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:31,653
<font color="yellow">Is that a birthday gift for Dr. Jeong? What is it?</font>

944
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:33,653
<font color="yellow">It's a speaker. Don't I have a great taste?</font>

945
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:37,653
<font color="yellow">- I want to show him. Did he go out? - He went out to see his friend.</font>

946
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:40,323
<font color="yellow">I think he said he was going to your school.</font>

947
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:41,883
<font color="yellow">He must have gone to see Ms. Go...</font>

948
00:54:46,223 --> 00:54:48,653
<font color="yellow">My mom packed a few dishes for you.</font>

949
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,023
<font color="yellow">Can I really accept it?</font>

950
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,153
<font color="yellow">If I do, are you going to lecture me again?</font>

951
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,623
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do that. I know I was wrong.</font>

952
00:54:57,223 --> 00:55:00,583
<font color="yellow">By the way, it looks like my mom liked you the other day.</font>

953
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,923
<font color="yellow">Hey. But I can't go out right now.</font>

954
00:55:04,323 --> 00:55:06,423
<font color="yellow">I have a student who hurt her back.</font>

955
00:55:06,923 --> 00:55:08,853
<font color="yellow">Then I should deliver it to you myself.</font>

956
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:15,753
<font color="yellow">The person you're trying to reach is not available.</font>

959
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,653
<font color="yellow">If you're here, park your car and come on up. Okay.</font>

960
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,823
<font color="yellow">Let's leave it on for another 20 minutes.</font>

961
00:55:29,823 --> 00:55:31,683
<font color="yellow">Luckily, I don't think you need a painkiller.</font>

962
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:33,483
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

963
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:39,753
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, please pick up. There's no time!</font>

964
00:55:47,683 --> 00:55:49,383
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Hyung.</font>

965
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:53,183
<font color="yellow">Tae Kwon. Go to the infirmary and get Chubs out of there.</font>

966
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,383
<font color="yellow">You must not let my brother see her.</font>

967
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:56,683
<font color="yellow">Just get her out of there. Okay?</font>

968
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,853
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

969
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:00,953
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Tae Kwon. - Hey.</font>

970
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:02,783
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's good that I ran into you.</font>

971
00:56:02,783 --> 00:56:04,823
<font color="yellow">There is an emergency.</font>

972
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:06,283
<font color="yellow">You must go to the parking lot,</font>

973
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,653
<font color="yellow">find a gray SUV which just came in.</font>

974
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:10,723
<font color="yellow">After that, stall the driver no matter what.</font>

975
00:56:11,023 --> 00:56:13,053
<font color="yellow">It's because Joon Hyung's brother is on that car.</font>

976
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:16,753
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung says if he goes to the infirmary, he will see Bok Joo.</font>

977
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,523
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my gosh. - That means...</font>

978
00:56:18,523 --> 00:56:20,053
<font color="yellow">- Let's find that car. - Okay.</font>

979
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:24,123
<font color="yellow">What is happening? I thought the crisis was over.</font>

980
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:26,553
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't let him find out. Keep running.</font>

981
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:30,183
<font color="yellow">- That's the car. - Let's go.</font>

982
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:34,153
<font color="yellow">Stop! Stop!</font>

983
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:38,283

985
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:43,023
<font color="yellow">How can you drive so poorly?</font>

986
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:45,123
<font color="yellow">You should see if there is a person on the road.</font>

987
00:56:45,123 --> 00:56:46,323
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

988
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:49,123
<font color="yellow">- That's not him, Seon Ok. - It's not?</font>

989
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,523
<font color="yellow">What? Where is he, then?</font>

990
00:56:58,283 --> 00:57:00,853
<font color="yellow">He should be here by now.</font>

992
00:57:22,483 --> 00:57:25,583
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo. This is an emergency. You should get out now.</font>

995
00:57:28,623 --> 00:57:31,723
<font color="yellow">I don't know why it's an emergency, but Joon Hyung wants you to get out.</font>

996
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:34,683
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - Did your mom make all these?</font>

997
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:39,323
<font color="yellow">I told you my mom is a great cook.</font>

998
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:43,583
<font color="yellow">She made so many dishes.</font>

999
00:57:44,623 --> 00:57:48,083
<font color="yellow">Hey. Please say thank you to your mom for me.</font>

1000
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:51,453
<font color="yellow">And please tell her that I won't stretch the meaning of this. Okay?</font>

1001
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:53,853
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I made one mistake, and you're giving me...</font>

1002
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:55,153
<font color="yellow">such a hard time.</font>

1003
00:57:55,153 --> 00:57:58,223
<font color="yellow">You should have a harder time. I'll keep bringing it up.</font>

1004
00:57:58,223 --> 00:57:59,883
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'm sorry.</font>

1005
00:58:00,453 --> 00:58:02,923
<font color="yellow">- Jae Yi! - What? Why are you here?</font>

1006
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,223
<font color="yellow">- Did you know I was here? - Yes.</font>

1007
00:58:05,223 --> 00:58:07,083
<font color="yellow">I went to your clinic to give you a present.</font>

1008
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:10,253
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I want to eat patbingsu.</font>

1009
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:12,553
<font color="yellow">Ms. Go, you should come, too. Jae Yi will pay.</font>

1010
00:58:12,553 --> 00:58:14,653
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't be absurd. It's cold.</font>

1011
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,953
<font color="yellow">You don't even like sweets. Why would you want to eat patbingsu?</font>

1012
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:18,753
<font color="yellow">No, I love patbingsu.</font>

1013
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:21,183
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll buy you one. Let's go together.</font>

1014
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:22,483
<font color="yellow">Give me a second.</font>

1015
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:30,083
<font color="yellow">- Jae Yi! - Gosh.</font>

1016
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:32,153
<font color="yellow">Listen. I'll be out for a while.</font>

1017
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:34,753
<font color="yellow">Stay here for five more minutes. Also, massage your back at night.</font>

1020
00:58:40,753 --> 00:58:42,953
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - All right. Let's go.</font>

1021
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,923
<font color="yellow">- Come on. Let's go. - Why are you in such a rush?</font>

1022
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,583
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - What's wrong with you today?</font>

1023
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,353
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I just want to eat patbingsu.</font>
