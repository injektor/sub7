155
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,010
<font color="yellow">Okay, Professor Yoon.</font>

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,310
<font color="yellow">Eat with determination and not for the taste.</font>

157
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,940
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi must increase by 1kg, and Bok Joo by 1.5kg.</font>

158
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
<font color="yellow">- Understand? - Yes, Coach.</font>

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,070
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Coach. - Go and get some fresh air.</font>

160
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,640
<font color="yellow">Let your family encourage you.</font>

161
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,870
<font color="yellow">Relax and eat delicious food.</font>

162
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,640
<font color="yellow">If you don't increase your weight,</font>

163
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,070
<font color="yellow">be prepared to eat 10 meals a day, okay?</font>

164
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,540
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

165
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,570
<font color="yellow">Isn't it difficult to increase your weight?</font>

166
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,940
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm not the only one having a hard time.</font>

167
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
<font color="yellow">If you're tired of eating protein,</font>

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,440
<font color="yellow">add eggs and make bread with it.</font>

169
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,810
<font color="yellow">Sang Chul told me about it, so I tried.</font>

170
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,110
<font color="yellow">I like it because of the texture.</font>

171
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,010
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll try it.</font>

172
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,440
<font color="yellow">- Are you going home? - Not yet.</font>

173
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,470
<font color="yellow">Someone is picking me up.</font>

174
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,180
<font color="yellow">- Goodness gracious. - I'll try it.</font>

175
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,710
<font color="yellow">You can't just leave after messing up the seat.</font>

176
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,680
<font color="yellow">It's only some milk powder.</font>

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,570
<font color="yellow">I don't need to pay for laundry, do I?</font>

178
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,910
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, I have to get going.</font>

179
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,870
<font color="yellow">See you, Woon Gi.</font>

180
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,740
<font color="yellow">Since you're English Literature majors,</font>

181
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,610
<font color="yellow">traveling abroad wouldn't be a problem, right?</font>

182
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,570
<font color="yellow">Aren't you fluent in English like native speakers?</font>

183
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,770
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

184
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,110
<font color="yellow">You don't swim across the Pacific Ocean because you're a swimmer.</font>

185
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,270
<font color="yellow">Cross the Pacific Ocean?</font>

186
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,740
<font color="yellow">You have such a great sense of humor.</font>

187
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,810
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

188
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,140
<font color="yellow">usually this quiet?</font>

189
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, compared to him.</font>

190
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,670
<font color="yellow">In which category do you compete?</font>

191
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,070
<font color="yellow">Is it short distance?</font>

192
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's why I don't talk much.</font>

193
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's a short-distance swimmer.</font>

194
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,340
<font color="yellow">(Chubs)</font>

195
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a moment.</font>

196
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,510
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Bok Joo who's incredibly busy?</font>

197
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,110
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for calling after missing three of my calls.</font>

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,270
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Are you home already?</font>

199
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,440
<font color="yellow">No, I'm out.</font>

200
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,670
<font color="yellow">Was Dr. Jeong shocked yesterday?</font>

201
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
<font color="yellow">- What did he say? - Good job for asking me only now.</font>

202
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were itching to find out.</font>

203
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,470
<font color="yellow">Are you at school?</font>

204
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,970
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,810
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chubs!</font>

206
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

207
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,970
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say anything? You startled me.</font>

208
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,540
<font color="yellow">Goodness, why did you startle me?</font>

209
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,270
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

210
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,470
<font color="yellow">Why did you make holes in the face of someone innocent?</font>

211
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,370
<font color="yellow">It's because I was getting bored of waiting.</font>

212
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,540
<font color="yellow">What did Dr. Jeong say?</font>

213
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,570
<font color="yellow">You ask me that so early.</font>

214
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,410
<font color="yellow">Weren't you itching to find out?</font>

215
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,270
<font color="yellow">He probably thought that I was just crazy...</font>

216
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,170
<font color="yellow">and stupid.</font>

217
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,110
<font color="yellow">That's not necessarily true.</font>

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,770
<font color="yellow">He was just flustered.</font>

219
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,970
<font color="yellow">Of course he would be. He found out that his patient is...</font>

220
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,840
<font color="yellow">a professional weightlifter.</font>

221
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,570
<font color="yellow">He asked why you had to lie to him.</font>

222
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,770
<font color="yellow">I made up an answer.</font>

223
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,810
<font color="yellow">I said maybe you have a crush on someone.</font>

224
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,840
<font color="yellow">Did you tell him who it was?</font>

225
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,270
<font color="yellow">I have common sense, too. Why would I tell him that?</font>

226
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,570
<font color="yellow">Does he think I'm pathetic?</font>

227
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,840
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think so.</font>

228
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,340
<font color="yellow">He was just flustered.</font>

229
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,440
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't told him that I was a cellist,</font>

230
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,810
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been such a crazy liar.</font>

231
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,870
<font color="yellow">Why did I ever say that I played the cello?</font>

232
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,440
<font color="yellow">I even went to a concert with him.</font>

233
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,510
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

234
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,010
<font color="yellow">You were happy to go on a date with him.</font>

235
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,410
<font color="yellow">Are you blaming me for it now?</font>

236
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,140
<font color="yellow">You can't do that!</font>

237
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,410
<font color="yellow">I wasn't blaming you. I was just saying.</font>

238
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

239
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,340
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

240
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,640
<font color="yellow">Why am I so unlucky?</font>

241
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,070
<font color="yellow">I don't care about weightlifting.</font>

242
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,010
<font color="yellow">I want to turn into a puff of smoke and disappear from Earth.</font>

243
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,970
<font color="yellow">Turning into a puff of smoke...</font>

244
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
<font color="yellow">would be impossible.</font>

245
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,610
<font color="yellow">You weigh too much.</font>

246
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

247
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,170
<font color="yellow">Being playful is becoming a habit.</font>

248
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,570
<font color="yellow">I'll be careful from now on.</font>

249
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,240
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go relieve stress?</font>

250
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,940
<font color="yellow">Come on, hurry up.</font>

251
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,640
<font color="yellow">- Let's stop. - We almost died, didn't we?</font>

252
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,540
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, watch me carefully.</font>

253
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,410
<font color="yellow">I'll set a new record.</font>

254
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,510
<font color="yellow">What do you think? No one can break my record for three years.</font>

255
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,470
<font color="yellow">Not even...</font>

256
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,940
<font color="yellow">a male weightlifter can break it.</font>

257
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
<font color="yellow">I set another record.</font>

258
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,770
<font color="yellow">Come on, does it hurt?</font>

259
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,140
<font color="yellow">- Why doesn't it work? - Be careful.</font>

260
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
<font color="yellow">- You might break your fingers. - Gosh!</font>

261
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,940
<font color="yellow">It's not coming back up. I think it's stuck.</font>

262
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,110
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I told you to be gentle.</font>

263
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,440
<font color="yellow">- Why doesn't this work? - Hey, stop it.</font>

264
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,470
<font color="yellow">- Hey, get up. - Why?</font>

265
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,010
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Just get up.</font>

266
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,170
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

267
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,040
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. Excuse me! - Run!</font>

268
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,070
<font color="yellow">I hate running so much.</font>

269
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,640
<font color="yellow">Why do I always run when I'm with you?</font>

270
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,440
<font color="yellow">I'll become a track and field champion in no time.</font>

271
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,470
<font color="yellow">You're an athlete. Shouldn't you be better at controlling your emotions?</font>

272
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,340
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? I still have so much stress to relieve.</font>

273
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know if there's a boxing gym nearby?</font>

274
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,010
<font color="yellow">Are you good at boxing?</font>

275
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,470
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, shall we just go grab a drink?</font>

276
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,870
<font color="yellow">Drink?</font>

277
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,210
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling that I'll drink a lot if we go for drinks now.</font>

278
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,210
<font color="yellow">(Mom)</font>

279
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,610
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Si Eon didn't come home yesterday.</font>

280
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,880
<font color="yellow">It looks like she took some clothes with her, too.</font>

281
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,740
<font color="yellow">- Hey, where are we going to sleep? - I have no idea.</font>

282
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,910
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Do we have any money?</font>

283
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,110
<font color="yellow">We have no money. Gosh, I'm annoyed.</font>

284
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,410
<font color="yellow">- We have nothing? - None.</font>

285
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,410
<font color="yellow">What? Did we spend it all?</font>

286
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what does she want?</font>

287
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,670
<font color="yellow">- What's she doing here? - I'm so annoyed.</font>

288
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,710
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

289
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,210
<font color="yellow">Guys, don't mind her. Let's go and...</font>

290
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,640
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Si Eon that I told you.</font>

291
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,410
<font color="yellow">One of her friends ran away from her family.</font>

292
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,510
<font color="yellow">She said she'd stay with her for a little while.</font>

293
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,340
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

294
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are you being like this?</font>

295
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,670
<font color="yellow">Why do you even care? It's my life.</font>

296
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,440
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that I should just watch you ruin your life?</font>

297
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,940
<font color="yellow">Since when were you so interested in my life?</font>

298
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,410
<font color="yellow">- Don't act like you care. - Just come with me.</font>

299
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,770
<font color="yellow">Taxi.</font>

300
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,510
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

301
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,040
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, seriously. - Just get in.</font>

302
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,740
<font color="yellow">- Hey. Open this! - Sir, please go. I don't know her.</font>

303

<font color="yellow">Hey, Si Eon!</font>

304
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,740
<font color="yellow">Look at the way you drink.</font>

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,710
<font color="yellow">You're an athlete. Your body is your asset.</font>

458
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,970
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't stay out late and make your friend drink.</font>

459
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,640
<font color="yellow">You won't become the top player this way.</font>

460
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,610
<font color="yellow">Don't you have dreams?</font>

461
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

462
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,210
<font color="yellow">Are you really?</font>

463
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

464
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,870
<font color="yellow">Can I go home now?</font>

465
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,110
<font color="yellow">Try to understand him.</font>

466
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,310
<font color="yellow">It may not seem that way,</font>

467
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,470
<font color="yellow">but my brother is very protective of Bok Joo.</font>

468
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,770
<font color="yellow">She's his only daughter.</font>

469
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,840
<font color="yellow">After his wife died young, he must've felt so bad for Bok Joo.</font>

470
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,910
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

471
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,670
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, then.</font>

472
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,810
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later. Oh, wait.</font>

473
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,470
<font color="yellow">Here. Take a cab with this money.</font>

474
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,440
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo must've exhausted you.</font>

475
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,440
<font color="yellow">No. I can take the bus.</font>

476
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,770
<font color="yellow">It's disrespectful not to accept it.</font>

477
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,470
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

478
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,010
<font color="yellow">I'm in favor.</font>

479
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,140
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - I'm in favor of you two dating.</font>

480
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,910
<font color="yellow">Let's have a drink sometime later,</font>

481
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,470
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo's future husband.</font>

482
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,640
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

483
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,010
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

484
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh, l should go.</font>

485
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,670
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung.</font>

486
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,570
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Jae Yi. - Where have you been?</font>

487
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,940
<font color="yellow">I just came out to go to the supermarket.</font>

488
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,070
<font color="yellow">You're lying.</font>

489
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,870
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi.</font>

490
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,940
<font color="yellow">Mom is angry, isn't she?</font>

491
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,810
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know. I told her you came home late,</font>

492
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,810
<font color="yellow">and you're asleep now.</font>

493
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,110
<font color="yellow">That's good. I wasn't sure if I could take her nagging.</font>

494
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,470
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

495
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,010
<font color="yellow">- Were you drinking? - I didn't drink much,</font>

496
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,640
<font color="yellow">but Bok Joo drank too much...</font>

497
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,470
<font color="yellow">when she can't even drink and got knocked out.</font>

498
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,440
<font color="yellow">So I took her home.</font>

499
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,640
<font color="yellow">- Did you drink with Bok Joo alone? - Yes.</font>

500
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,370
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

501
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,670
<font color="yellow">I'll sneak in and get some sleep.</font>

502
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,070
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you.</font>

503
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,670
<font color="yellow">You're causing all kinds of trouble these days.</font>

504
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,910
<font color="yellow">You made me cook hangover soup for you.</font>

505
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,340
<font color="yellow">We have tons of alcohol here.</font>

506
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,370
<font color="yellow">Why did you go out to drink?</font>

507
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,540
<font color="yellow">And even with a guy.</font>

508
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad. It won't happen again.</font>

509
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,110
<font color="yellow">Eat it slowly. I'm heating up the boiled pork.</font>

510
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,040
<font color="yellow">It's too early to have boiled pork.</font>

511
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,940
<font color="yellow">Sure. Having boiled pork in the morning will help me put on weight.</font>

512
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,310
<font color="yellow">Our dear Bok Joo.</font>

513
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,870
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

514
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,810
<font color="yellow">like him as your future husband.</font>

515
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,240
<font color="yellow">- What? - To improve the seed of our family,</font>

516
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,470
<font color="yellow">I think we need a handsome guy like him.</font>

517
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,540
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Nothing will happen between me and him.</font>

518
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,740
<font color="yellow">He's already seen things he shouldn't have.</font>

519
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
<font color="yellow">"He's seen..."</font>

520
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,040
<font color="yellow">"things he shouldn't have?"</font>

521
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,010
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

522
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,240
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

523
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,140
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I can understand that.</font>

524
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,410
<font color="yellow">We're living in the 21st century.</font>

525
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,370
<font color="yellow">Things can happen when a grown man and a woman drink together.</font>

526
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,940
<font color="yellow">You're two vigorous youths.</font>

527
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,410
<font color="yellow">I'm not an old-fashioned person.</font>

528
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,140
<font color="yellow">Just admit it.</font>

529
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,010
<font color="yellow">I told you it's not like that. We just drank.</font>

530
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,110
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

531
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,110
<font color="yellow">Fine. I guess you're too shy.</font>

532
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,340
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll tell you first.</font>

533
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,040
<font color="yellow">I lost my virginity when...</font>

534
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,240
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Dad!</font>

535
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,470
<font color="yellow">- I was... - Stop Uncle!</font>

536
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,240
<font color="yellow">- Dad! - What did he do now?</font>

537
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,610
<font color="yellow">- He's a pervert! - What did you...</font>

538
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,240
<font color="yellow">say to her?</font>

539
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,510
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Eat up.</font>

540
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,940
<font color="yellow">What time did you get home, Joon Hyung?</font>

541
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,540
<font color="yellow">Right after you went to bed.</font>

542
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you must've drunk a lot.</font>

543
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,210
<font color="yellow">I can smell alcohol from your clothes.</font>

544
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you know I grew up in this neighborhood?</font>

545
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,770
<font color="yellow">Keep this up, and everyone will say my son always stays out late.</font>

546
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,240
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mom. I'm sorry.</font>

547
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mom. I really am.</font>

548
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,040
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You're so sly.</font>

549
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,270
<font color="yellow">When are you going back to school?</font>

550
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,170
<font color="yellow">After I'm done eating. Why?</font>

551
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,440
<font color="yellow">Your dad keeps saying he feels listless these days.</font>

552
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,070
<font color="yellow">I was going to go and buy milk vetch roots.</font>

553
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh, a daughter will be perfect for this kind of things.</font>

554
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,870
<font color="yellow">What about you, Jae Yi? Do you have plans?</font>

555
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,240
<font color="yellow">Yes. Ah Young is buying a stereo, and she wants me to look at it.</font>

556
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,970
<font color="yellow">- I can cancel it, though. - Ah Young?</font>

557
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,410
<font color="yellow">Then you should go and help her.</font>

558
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,910
<font color="yellow">I can go to the market by myself.</font>

559
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,910
<font color="yellow">You should go. Go and help her.</font>

560
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,970
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

561
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,510
<font color="yellow">- Don't forget your medicine. - Yes, Mom.</font>

562
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
<font color="yellow">Woon Gi.</font>

563
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,510
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Coach Choi.</font>

564
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,640
<font color="yellow">You punched a taxi driver? Why?</font>

565
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,740
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

566
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,310
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me sooner?</font>

567
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

568
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,440
<font color="yellow">After a careful consideration, we registered our marriage...</font>

569
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,410
<font color="yellow">and gave birth to our child.</font>

570
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,510
<font color="yellow">I just couldn't tell you.</font>

571
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,140
<font color="yellow">You're right. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to say it, too.</font>

572
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,610
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

573
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,040
<font color="yellow">You have a wife and a child.</font>

574
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,970
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit someone? What were you thinking?</font>

575
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,670
<font color="yellow">He swore at my wife.</font>

576
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,570
<font color="yellow">- I couldn't stand it. - My gosh.</font>

577
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,370
<font color="yellow">It looked like he's holding out thinking he hit the jackpot.</font>

578
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,470
<font color="yellow">For now,</font>

579
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,140
<font color="yellow">let's try to settle it with the money I got.</font>

580
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,510
<font color="yellow">No, Coach. I'll figure out something and...</font>

581
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,040
<font color="yellow">How are you going to make 3,000 dollars? Do you have money?</font>

582
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,370
<font color="yellow">Your wife is working because you can't even afford...</font>

583
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,470
<font color="yellow">her to stay in a postnatal care center.</font>

584
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,770
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure...</font>

585
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,570
<font color="yellow">to pay you back that money.</font>

586
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,840
<font color="yellow">Of course you will.</font>

587
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,170
<font color="yellow">- Have you named your baby yet? - We named the baby Soon Ri.</font>

588
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,170
<font color="yellow">We wanted the baby to go with the flow and live in comfort.</font>

589
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,780
<font color="yellow">That's a good name.</font>

590
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Soon Ri's dad.</font>

591
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,570
<font color="yellow">If you ever keep a secret from me again,</font>

592
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,170
<font color="yellow">I will kill you.</font>

593
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,140
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hi, it's me.</font>

594
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,140
<font color="yellow">It's about the money you borrowed from me before.</font>

595
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,940
<font color="yellow">Can you pay me back this month?</font>

596
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,140
<font color="yellow">If you're going to put it in the infirmary,</font>

597
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,870
<font color="yellow">I think a Bluetooth stereo would be better.</font>

598
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,210
<font color="yellow">It's more convenient.</font>

599
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

600
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,040
<font color="yellow">But there're so many kinds. I don't know which one to pick.</font>

601
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,210
<font color="yellow">I think this is better than the one we saw earlier.</font>

602
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,140
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

603
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,810
<font color="yellow">I should listen to the expert, then.</font>

604
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
<font color="yellow">I'll take this.</font>

605
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,340
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Please have a seat and wait. - Okay.</font>

606
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,740
<font color="yellow">There're so many.</font>

607
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,740
<font color="yellow">Since you recommended it,</font>

608
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,140
<font color="yellow">you should install it, too.</font>

609
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,410
<font color="yellow">- For free. - Gosh.</font>

610
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,310
<font color="yellow">Now I know why people get conned without realizing.</font>

611
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,470
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you an expensive meal instead.</font>

612
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, by the way,</font>

613
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,370
<font color="yellow">do you know someone named Kim Bok Joo...</font>

614
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,340
<font color="yellow">in your school's weightlifting team?</font>

615
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo?</font>

616
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,840
<font color="yellow">She's the ace of her team. She's the tall one.</font>

617
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,840
<font color="yellow">I mentioned a patient who asked me about Messi. Do you remember?</font>

618
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,310
<font color="yellow">I do. You said it was memorable.</font>

619
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,710
<font color="yellow">That patient is the student I just asked about.</font>

620
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,670
<font color="yellow">What? That can't be true.</font>

621
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,070
<font color="yellow">Why would a weightlifter go to a weight clinic?</font>

622
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,740
<font color="yellow">She told me she was a cellist.</font>

623
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,410
<font color="yellow">But I bumped into her at school.</font>

624
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,780
<font color="yellow">That's how I found out that she does weightlifting at your school.</font>

625
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,170
<font color="yellow">That's so strange.</font>

626
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,470
<font color="yellow">Joon Hyung said it's because she has a crush on someone.</font>

627
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,140
<font color="yellow">Also, Bok Joo went to elementary school with Joon Hyung.</font>

628
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,170
<font color="yellow">Really? What a small world.</font>

629
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,670
<font color="yellow">Who does she have a crush on?</font>

630
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,210
<font color="yellow">She has a regular schedule, so she doesn't meet many men.</font>

631
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,170
<font color="yellow">Does she like Joon Hyung?</font>

632
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,780
<font color="yellow">After all, he's popular at school.</font>

633
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,970
<font color="yellow">He's popular among many freshmen girls.</font>

634
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,510
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

635
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,470
<font color="yellow">They seemed quite close.</font>

636
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,710
<font color="yellow">- They drank until late last night. - Really?</font>

637
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,280
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's him.</font>

638
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,710
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel excited? I hope they get together.</font>

639
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jae Yi.</font>

640
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,740
<font color="yellow">I took a lot of your time, so I'll treat you to anything you choose.</font>

641
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,170
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

642
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,710
<font color="yellow">Do you want spaghetti or pasta?</font>

643
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,910
<font color="yellow">My hourly rate is high. What's something that's expensive?</font>

644
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,110
<font color="yellow">Just say what you want.</font>

645
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo.</font>

646
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,710
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dr. Jeong.</font>

647
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,140
<font color="yellow">Bok Joo, I heard about what happened.</font>

648
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,070
<font color="yellow">You caused such a big trouble. It must have been so much fun.</font>

649
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,640
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

650
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,510
<font color="yellow">You still have some time. Let's go eat together.</font>

651
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,970
<font color="yellow">- Call Joon Hyung, too. - Excuse me?</font>

652
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,940
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

653
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,910
<font color="yellow">You should join us. I wanted to treat you to a meal.</font>

654
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,170
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

655
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,170
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Get in.</font>

656
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,780
<font color="yellow">- How about a steak? - Let's eat steak.</font>

657
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,840
<font color="yellow">You love meat.</font>

658
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,740
<font color="yellow">- What else? - How about soup?</font>

659
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,140
<font color="yellow">Let's order a salad for...</font>

660
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,210
<font color="yellow">- Bok Joo. - A salad?</font>

661
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,280
<font color="yellow">Right, you can eat something else.</font>

662
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,740
<font color="yellow">How about...</font>

663
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,870
<font color="yellow">How about this one?</font>

664
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,870
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi, Dr. Go.</font>

665
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,040
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Over here, Joon Hyung.</font>

666
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,370
<font color="yellow">Why are we meeting together?</font>

667
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,070
<font color="yellow">Jae Yi set up the sound system. We met Bok Joo on our way to eat.</font>

668
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you two went to the same elementary school.</font>

669
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,370
<font color="yellow">It's not something to brag about.</font>

670
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,870
<font color="yellow">It turns out that Bok Joo was the one...</font>

671
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,410
<font color="yellow">who asked Jae Yi about Messi.</font>

672
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,440
<font color="yellow">I was so surprised.</font>

673
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,870
<font color="yellow">I had no idea.</font>

674
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,810
<font color="yellow">It's a lot of food. Help yourselves.</font>

675
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,740
<font color="yellow">Enjoy, Jae Yi. Thank you for your help.</font>

676
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

677
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

678
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,940
<font color="yellow">I can't help but ask questions about things I'm curious about.</font>

679
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,970
<font color="yellow">May I ask you a question?</font>

680
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,340
<font color="yellow">Do you have a crush on someone at our school?</font>

681
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,280
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

682
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,610
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

683
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,410
<font color="yellow">Stop it. You're invading her privacy.</font>

684
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,940
<font color="yellow">Right, I'm sorry for being nosy.</font>

685
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,370
<font color="yellow">Since when were you close to Joon Hyung?</font>

686
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,110
<font color="yellow">I've been working at the school over a year,</font>

687
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,440
<font color="yellow">but I had no idea.</font>

688
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,070
<font color="yellow">We met again only recently.</font>

689
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,810
<font color="yellow">- He's changed so much. - Really?</font>

690
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,640
<font color="yellow">I bet you were surprised.</font>

691
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,670
<font color="yellow">He used to be so small, but now he's all tall and grown up.</font>

692
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,540
<font color="yellow">My heart would have fluttered if I were you.</font>

693
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,310
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, you two look great together.</font>

694
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,870
<font color="yellow">Is it because they're both tall?</font>

695
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,110
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

696
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,170
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dr. Go. You're exaggerating.</font>

697
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,970
<font color="yellow">Do you realize how unnatural you sound?</font>

698
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,170
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not exaggerating.</font>

699
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,170
<font color="yellow">- You two look great together. - Come on.</font>

700
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,280
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking and eat. The food is getting cold.</font>

701
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat. - Okay.</font>

702
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,610
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to shut it and eat? Fine.</font>

703
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
<font color="yellow">Come On.</font>

704
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,140
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

705
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,110
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's a rib.</font>

706
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,340
<font color="yellow">- It's so delicious. - Here you go.</font>

707
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
<font color="yellow">Here's one for you, Bok Joo.</font>

708
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

709
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,870
<font color="yellow">- Please take one. - Here.</font>

710
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

711
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,670
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

712
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,710
<font color="yellow">You have to try it.</font>

713
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,640
<font color="yellow">Look how meaty it is.</font>

714
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,740
<font color="yellow">Eat it with the pasta.</font>

715
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,410
<font color="yellow">- Try it. - You like this, don't you?</font>

716
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,440
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.</font>

717
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

718
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,310
<font color="yellow">You helped me today, so I'll give you a ride.</font>

719
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,510
<font color="yellow">Do you want a ride, too? I can drop you off.</font>

720
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,540
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. We can walk. - Okay.</font>

721
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,370
<font color="yellow">You'll look great walking together.</font>

722
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,870
<font color="yellow">- See you later. - Take care. See you again, Bok Joo.</font>

723
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,840
<font color="yellow">Dr. Go's assumption was wrong, don't you think?</font>

724
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,170
<font color="yellow">That's not important.</font>

725
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,370
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.</font>

726
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,470
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it,</font>

727
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,510
<font color="yellow">it turned out for the better.</font>

728
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,740
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

729
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
<font color="yellow">The lunch we had today.</font>

730
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,740
<font color="yellow">I felt uncomfortable about how we parted last time.</font>

731
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,670
<font color="yellow">Now, I feel like things came to a close.</font>

732
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,810
<font color="yellow">All I have to do is concentrate on my competition.</font>

733
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,470
<font color="yellow">Can you get ready for the competition when you sound so weak?</font>

734
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,170
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

735
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,970
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel so listless and empty?</font>

736
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,570
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

737
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,280
<font color="yellow">By the way, Dr. Go and Dr. Jeong looked great together.</font>

738
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,710
<font color="yellow">They seemed close.</font>

739
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,110
<font color="yellow">It's because they're colleagues from medical school.</font>

740
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,370
<font color="yellow">They're on the same level.</font>

741
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,940
<font color="yellow">Dr. Go is pretty.</font>

742
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,340
<font color="yellow">She has a great personality, and she's a doctor.</font>

743
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,640
<font color="yellow">You're good, too.</font>

744
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,470
<font color="yellow">You're healthy.</font>

745
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,940
<font color="yellow">Is that supposed to make me feel better? You're terrible.</font>

746
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,340
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat something?</font>

747
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,970
<font color="yellow">We just had lunch.</font>

748
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,940
<font color="yellow">I don't eat all the time.</font>

749
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
<font color="yellow">How about...</font>

750
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,940
<font color="yellow">watching a movie?</font>

751
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,570
<font color="yellow">Or go to a club?</font>

752
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,610
<font color="yellow">How about a drive to the sea?</font>

753
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,810
<font color="yellow">Can you drive?</font>

754
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,140
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a car? - I have a car that isn't mine.</font>

755
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,280
<font color="yellow">It won't take long to get to the sea.</font>

756
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,470
<font color="yellow">No, it's too far away. Forget it.</font>

757
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,110
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go to the sea.</font>

758
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,110
<font color="yellow">You lose if you don't, rock-paper-scissors.</font>

759
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,410
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

760
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,940
<font color="yellow">- Can we go? - Yes, we can.</font>

761
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, you look very aggressive.</font>

762
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,340
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get in?</font>

763
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,280
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Dr. Jeong's...</font>

764
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,780
<font color="yellow">It is, but it's also mine.</font>

765
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,670
<font color="yellow">I've been driving it secretly for some years.</font>

766
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,340
<font color="yellow">I have the emergency key. I'm sure Jae Yi knows that I drive it.</font>

767
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,810
<font color="yellow">Can you drive well?</font>

768
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,340
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm the best driver.</font>

769
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,210
<font color="yellow">Where's the seat belt?</font>

770
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,170
<font color="yellow">Put on the seat belt.</font>

771
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,540
<font color="yellow">- I wonder if this is okay. - Okay.</font>

772
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,540
<font color="yellow">To come back by midnight, we don't have much time.</font>

773
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,170
<font color="yellow">Hold on tight. There won't be any turning back.</font>

774
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,570
<font color="yellow">What do you think? Don't I drive well?</font>

775
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,640
<font color="yellow">You drive like a beginner. I'm getting motion sickness.</font>

776
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,870
<font color="yellow">It's perfect how it keeps me alert.</font>

777
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,510
<font color="yellow">This is all a strategy.</font>

778
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,310
<font color="yellow">It's hard to pretend like I'm bad at driving.</font>

779
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,310
<font color="yellow">Either way, it's good to be out.</font>

780
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,870
<font color="yellow">Aren't you glad that you listened to me?</font>

781
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,470
<font color="yellow">Do you regret...</font>

782
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,670
<font color="yellow">lying to Jae Yi about weightlifting?</font>

783
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,310
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

784
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,170
<font color="yellow">Even if I were to go back in time,</font>

785
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,040
<font color="yellow">I would have lied again.</font>

786
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,840
<font color="yellow">Why? Aren't you proud of your weightlifting?</font>

787
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,440
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with a woman who does weightlifting?</font>

788
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,970
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm very proud of myself...</font>

789
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,040
<font color="yellow">as a professional weightlifter.</font>

790
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,310
<font color="yellow">A woman who does weightlifting...</font>

791
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,570
<font color="yellow">may be impressive, but she isn't exactly beautiful.</font>

792
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,170
<font color="yellow">What's the difference?</font>

793
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,940
<font color="yellow">Here's the difference.</font>

794
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,370
<font color="yellow">The senior female weightlifters who have boyfriends...</font>

795
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,670
<font color="yellow">don't usually invite their boyfriends to competitions.</font>

796
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,410
<font color="yellow">We lift heavy lumps of metal.</font>

797
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,670
<font color="yellow">In that moment,</font>

798
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,440
<font color="yellow">we can't help but show our veins popping out,</font>

799
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,970
<font color="yellow">our faces getting red, our double or triple chins,</font>

800
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,040
<font color="yellow">and our belly fat sticking out from the belt. It's so ugly.</font>

801
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,070
<font color="yellow">We say that our looks aren't everything.</font>

802
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,810
<font color="yellow">Being dedicated to achieving our dream is...</font>

803
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,110
<font color="yellow">more important.</font>

804
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,470
<font color="yellow">However, it's not something we want to show to the guy we like.</font>

805
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,440
<font color="yellow">So in some ways,</font>

806
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,440
<font color="yellow">choosing to be a weightlifter...</font>

807
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,440
<font color="yellow">might mean that I have to...</font>

808
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,170
<font color="yellow">give up living as a woman to a certain extent.</font>

809
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,670
<font color="yellow">That's what I've been thinking.</font>

810
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,910
<font color="yellow">That is complete nonsense.</font>

811
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:57,210
<font color="yellow">You just have to meet a guy who can even love that about you.</font>

812
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,170
<font color="yellow">It's easier said than done. It's hard to find a guy like that.</font>

813
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, they exist. Take me for an example...</font>

814
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you see those seagulls over there?</font>

815
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,540
<font color="yellow">There's a flock of them. Did you see?</font>

816
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,110
<font color="yellow">- Over there. Oh, my. - I have to look straight ahead.</font>

817
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,570
<font color="yellow">Do you want to do that thing?</font>

818
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,340
<font color="yellow">What's it called? The boat where you can...</font>

819
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,670
<font color="yellow">feed seagulls. Is this off-season for it?</font>

820
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, I have to drive. I can't look around right now.</font>

821
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,310
<font color="yellow">You haven't done it? You're so lame.</font>

822
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,610
<font color="yellow">- What a loser. - Choose between seagulls and me.</font>

823
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,770
<font color="yellow">Seagulls.</font>

824
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,610
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you one last time. Seagulls or me?</font>

825
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,640
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

826
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,070
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go for barbecue?</font>

827
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,010
<font color="yellow">Look at the ocean! The sea breeze feels so nice.</font>

828
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,470
<font color="yellow">Hi, seagulls!</font>

829
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,470
<font color="yellow">Have you never been to a beach or what? Stop acting so lame.</font>

830
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,110
<font color="yellow">I've been so stressed out, but being here has totally refreshed me.</font>

831
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,070
<font color="yellow">I should really be here with a boyfriend.</font>

832
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,770
<font color="yellow">It'd be so romantic to play silly games...</font>

833
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,170
<font color="yellow">and write each other's names in the sand.</font>

834
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,370
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you a little too old for that?</font>

835
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,240
<font color="yellow">You're so immature.</font>

836
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,040
<font color="yellow">Grow up already, will you?</font>

837
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,370
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

838
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,540
<font color="yellow">- Hey, hey! - Try and catch me!</font>

839
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,740
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

840
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,810
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon Hyung!</font>

841
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,140
<font color="yellow">I need head support. Let me use your arm.</font>

842
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,370
<font color="yellow">Chubs, is it because you lift heavy weights?</font>

843
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,710
<font color="yellow">Even your head is heavy.</font>

844
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,870
<font color="yellow">Get a taste of this.</font>

845
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,110
<font color="yellow">I actually tasted death.</font>

846
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,470
<font color="yellow">It was for fun. Why did you have to get all feisty?</font>

847
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,040
<font color="yellow">You know how competitive I can be.</font>

848
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,870
<font color="yellow">You're actually a pretty good runner.</font>

849
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,910
<font color="yellow">I ran away to survive.</font>

850
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,240
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

851
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,810
<font color="yellow">I've shown you all sorts of things.</font>

852
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,670
<font color="yellow">How did this happen?</font>

853
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,810
<font color="yellow">So? Do you think it's unfair?</font>

854
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,070
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.</font>

855
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,140
<font color="yellow">I've told you everything about me,</font>

856
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,970
<font color="yellow">but all I know about you is your trauma.</font>

857
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,270
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything else.</font>

858
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,170
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

859
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,640
<font color="yellow">Then I'll tell you something, too.</font>

860
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,510
<font color="yellow">When we were in elementary school...</font>

861
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,870
<font color="yellow">Ouch! Who pulled my hair?</font>

862
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,310
<font color="yellow">Whose chocolate is this?</font>

863
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,970
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. - What is it?</font>

864
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,840
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it if it doesn't belong to anyone!</font>

865
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,170
<font color="yellow">- Okay! - Go ahead.</font>

866
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,910
<font color="yellow">- Can I really eat it? - Yes!</font>

867
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,840
<font color="yellow">Someone used to put chocolates and candies on your desk, right?</font>

868
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,070
<font color="yellow">It was me.</font>

869
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,510
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

870
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,340
<font color="yellow">Did you have a crush on me?</font>

871
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,210
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're overreacting again.</font>

872
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,370
<font color="yellow">You saved my life, you know.</font>

873
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,610
<font color="yellow">I wanted to thank you.</font>

874
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,040
<font color="yellow">I also thought you were cool.</font>

875
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,010
<font color="yellow">You know how timid I used to be back then.</font>

876
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,370
<font color="yellow">But you got along with other kids so well,</font>

877
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,570
<font color="yellow">and you were always brave...</font>

878
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,240
<font color="yellow">and strong.</font>

879
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,510
<font color="yellow">That was nothing special.</font>

880
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,540
<font color="yellow">It wasn't even a big secret.</font>

881
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,810
<font color="yellow">You want something bigger?</font>

882
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,970
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I thought it was a pretty big secret.</font>

883
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,010
<font color="yellow">Then I'll let you in on a huge secret.</font>

884
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, please. Tell me everything.</font>

885
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,340
<font color="yellow">It's about Jae Yi.</font>

886
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,710
<font color="yellow">He's not really my brother.</font>

887
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,440
<font color="yellow">He's actually my cousin.</font>

888
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,010
<font color="yellow">The people whom I call my parents now are actually my uncle and aunt.</font>

889
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,070
<font color="yellow">When my mom got remarried,</font>

890
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,170
<font color="yellow">she left me with my uncle and aunt.</font>

891
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:02,770
<font color="yellow">Then she moved to Canada.</font>

892
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,040
<font color="yellow">Is that why you transferred to a different school all of a sudden?</font>

893
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,870
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

894
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,710
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even say goodbye to you.</font>

895
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,210
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

896
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,810
<font color="yellow">Don't give me that pitiful look.</font>

897
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,810
<font color="yellow">It wasn't too bad.</font>

898
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:24,070
<font color="yellow">My uncle and aunt have been so good to me,</font>

899
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,510
<font color="yellow">and Jae Yi couldn't have been any sweeter to me.</font>

900
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,540
<font color="yellow">You see, my personality has changed so much.</font>

901
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,310
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have changed like this if I had an unhappy childhood.</font>

902
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,170
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

903
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,270
<font color="yellow">everyone keeps...</font>

904
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,640
<font color="yellow">a few painful wounds buried in his or her heart.</font>

905
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,870
<font color="yellow">If they can move on, it's great.</font>

906
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,210
<font color="yellow">Even if they can't, they still live.</font>

907
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,240
<font color="yellow">They become numb to the pain with time.</font>

908
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,570
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine soon, too.</font>

909
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,510
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>
