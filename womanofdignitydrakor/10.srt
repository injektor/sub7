00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Just leave her painting up?</font>

3
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,803
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you, Buddha?</font>

4
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:25,757
<font color=#FFFF00>Or you just don't have any feelings
for your husband anyways?</font>

5
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,826
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm baffled!</font>

6
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:39,818
<font color=#FFFF00>This lady...</font>

7
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:41,913
<font color=#FFFF00>Messed with my woman?</font>

8
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Incredible!</font>

00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,343
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 10: The last brunch)</font>

10
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I got the call from Father.</font>

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You can take care of the factory
rent account from now on.</font>

12
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,373
<font color=#FFFF00>We...</font>

13
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,483
<font color=#FFFF00>Plan to move somewhere else.</font>

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,632
<font color=#FFFF00>We were thinking about
moving out anyways.</font>

15
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:32,351
<font color=#FFFF00>We already bought a place.</font>

16
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,749
<font color=#FFFF00>You can take care of the matters
of this house from now.</font>

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
<font color=#FFFF00>OK.</font>

18
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,764
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do that.</font>

19
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:45,023
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow...</font>

20
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Where will you move to?</font>

21
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey?</font>

22
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:05,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Your second son's family wants to move out.</font>

23
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:05,913
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

24
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:07,366
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually...</font>

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,733
<font color=#FFFF00>There was a bit of a headache.</font>

26
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:13,379
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae-suk's cheating on his wife.</font>

27
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:14,937
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:20,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I know very well how you feel about Ah-jin.</font>

29
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:24,780
<font color=#FFFF00>And your company is facing a crucial
time just about now.</font>

30
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:28,265
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it'd be a huge disaster if
Jae-suk, who's in charge of the company,</font>

31
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,171
<font color=#FFFF00>made that kind of a mistake.</font>

32
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,726
<font color=#FFFF00>So I got involved a little.</font>

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,030
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? You need to elaborate.</font>

34
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:39,632
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out that Jae-suk has been
cheating on his wife.</font>

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to her house, the woman
Jae-suk was cheating with.</font>

36
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:43,687
<font color=#FFFF00>You went there? Then?</font>

37
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,858
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

38
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,538
<font color=#FFFF00>She's got a nice body.</font>

39
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:48,265
<font color=#FFFF00>She had a pretty face,</font>

40
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,515
<font color=#FFFF00>and also young.</font>

41
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:53,601
<font color=#FFFF00>She was good all around, except
for her heart.</font>

42
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:56,062
<font color=#FFFF00>Has he gone mad? What's wrong with him?</font>

43
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,835
<font color=#FFFF00>It's no time to fool around like that!</font>

44
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,554
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she's the one who designed
the product casings.</font>

45
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,499
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the artist behind that design.</font>

46
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,365
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

47
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,843
<font color=#FFFF00>She had a lot of painting in her house.</font>

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,920
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're saying...</font>

49
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:20,179
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason why he's been putting on that
cartoon stuff on every product...</font>

50
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:21,795
<font color=#FFFF00>is her?</font>

51
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,374
<font color=#FFFF00>They seemed so close, beyond ordinary.</font>

52
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,741
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he be trusted to run the company
with that kind of a mentality?</font>

53
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:33,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't help but to think that
it'd be hard.</font>

54
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is this guy?</font>

55
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,701
<font color=#FFFF00>What a crazy bastard!</font>

56
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,232
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the most normal one among
all my children, that's why</font>

57
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I put him in charge!</font>

58
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:42,562
<font color=#FFFF00>And he goes and cheats on his wife?</font>

59
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Park!</font>

60
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,343
<font color=#FFFF00>You entered the residence of Unit 306
without the consent of the occupant!</font>

61
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:47,843
<font color=#FFFF00>You destroyed her property!</font>

62
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:51,796
<font color=#FFFF00>And you've violated the human rights
of a weak, helpless woman!</font>

63
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:55,036
<font color=#FFFF00>Not only that, you caused
physical harm to her!</font>

64
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:56,851
<font color=#FFFF00>You bastard!</font>

65
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:57,515
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

66
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:58,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

67
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,835
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, what are you doing?</font>

68
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:03,384
<font color=#FFFF00>You're cheating? Did you cheat on her?</font>

69
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:07,960
<font color=#FFFF00>You're gonna rip my mouth!</font>

70
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:09,659
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a crazy fool!</font>

71
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:12,023
<font color=#FFFF00>You should at least cheat behind
Ah-jin and Ji-hoo's backs!</font>

72
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:15,288
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you're doing?
You're better off putting this on the news!</font>

73
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, why are you doing this to me?</font>

74
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if everyone else doesn't,
at least you should understand!</font>

75
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:22,687
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say? Are you crazy?</font>

76
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,897
<font color=#FFFF00>You lived your entire life doing
whatever you want!</font>

77
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,601
<font color=#FFFF00>You cheated with many women!</font>

78
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,624
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

79
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,937
<font color=#FFFF00>So you think that gives you
the right to cheat, too?</font>

80
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,171
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that, but...</font>

81
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,015
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have a right to criticize me.</font>

82
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:37,358
<font color=#FFFF00>A man needs to be responsible!</font>

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,405
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a wife and a kid,
this is absurd!</font>

84
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, please stop.</font>

85
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,679
<font color=#FFFF00>You should help me instead!</font>

86
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:44,318
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Help you?</font>

87
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,507
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

88
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Love that woman.</font>

89
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:47,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Which one?</font>

90
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,335
<font color=#FFFF00>That one.</font>

91
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:49,780
<font color=#FFFF00>So which one?</font>

92
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:50,640
<font color=#FFFF00>The new one.</font>

93
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,397
<font color=#FFFF00>What? The new one?</font>

94
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,241
<font color=#FFFF00>What's Ah-jin then? Just your old wife?</font>

95
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,546
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you talk like that?</font>

96
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,476
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even deserve to live!</font>

97
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,616
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

98
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,733
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what love is like, don't you?</font>

99
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,796
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't control it!</font>

100
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,780
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like you chose to love
this lady either!</font>

101
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,335
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't control whom we love!</font>

102
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:15,171
<font color=#FFFF00>She just came into my life like a comet!</font>

103
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:16,802
<font color=#FFFF00>End it right away!</font>

104
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,632
<font color=#FFFF00>And kneel in front of Ah-jin and beg
for her forgiveness!</font>

105
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:20,733
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

106
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:21,866
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do that.</font>

107
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:24,416
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what? You're gonna get a divorce?</font>

108
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:25,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I?</font>

109
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,319
<font color=#FFFF00>I do love that woman.</font>

110
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:28,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Which one?</font>

111
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:29,280
<font color=#FFFF00>That woman.</font>

112
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,726
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, so which one?</font>

113
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:31,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

114
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,505
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a total nut job.</font>

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,749
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey you!</font>

116
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,327
<font color=#FFFF00>The other one's "the new woman,"</font>

117
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,585
<font color=#FFFF00>and this one's "Ah-jin"?</font>

118
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you happy you have so many women
around? Are you?</font>

119
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:44,404
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop hitting me!</font>

120
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,374
<font color=#FFFF00>You got a mistress too, how can you
do this to me?</font>

121
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:48,515
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

122
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,312
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not my mistress, she's my
second wife!</font>

123
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,382
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the same thing.</font>

124
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,013
<font color=#FFFF00>Completely different.</font>

125
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:58,632
<font color=#FFFF00>If you ever go mess with her
like that again,</font>

126
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,046
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't just sit still!</font>

127
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:00,976
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

128
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,511
<font color=#FFFF00>What? You won't just sit still?</font>

129
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,108
<font color=#FFFF00>Who do you think you are, you're
just full of crap!</font>

130
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,882
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop hitting me!</font>

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,351
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna kick you out of the company
if you don't break up with her now!</font>

132
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:13,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Which one?</font>

133
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:15,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You think I'm joking around, you bastard?</font>

134
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:24,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't get a divorce.</font>

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,413
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't break up with that woman either.</font>

136
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,397
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'm going to work hard at
running the company.</font>

137
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:31,537
<font color=#FFFF00>That is all.</font>

138
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,411
<font color=#FFFF00>You little...</font>

139
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,675
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do with that guy?</font>

140
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Ahn! You're walking on your own!</font>

141
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,793
<font color=#FFFF00>You're walking all by yourself!</font>

142
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,522
<font color=#FFFF00>I... Am!</font>

143
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,147
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm walking!</font>

144
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Ahn!</font>

145
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:01,624
<font color=#FFFF00>That ungrateful son of yours
did something good!</font>

146
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Great job!</font>

147
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:16,052
<font color=#FFFF00>I filed a police report and gave them
my testimony.</font>

148
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You could've done that after
you're released from here.</font>

149
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,321
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've been in a hurry.</font>

150
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,632
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't settle, I'll make sure
the person goes to jail.</font>

151
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,101
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

152
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I worried because of my son.</font>

153
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,475
<font color=#FFFF00>But I just can't get myself to forgive.</font>

154
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:35,421
<font color=#FFFF00>Just do whatever you want, whatever it is.</font>

155
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:40,694
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm curious to see how far you can go.</font>

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

157
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,354
<font color=#FFFF00>You're gonna hit me here?</font>

158
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,954
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think people will see?</font>

159
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:50,592
<font color=#FFFF00>Jail...</font>

160
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,801
<font color=#FFFF00>You might end up there instead.</font>

161
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,827
<font color=#FFFF00>What makes you so confident?</font>

162
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,412
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing at all.</font>

163
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,022
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got better at taking your punches,
after years of being beaten.</font>

164
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:09,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe that's why I'm not as scared.</font>

165
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,483
<font color=#FFFF00>I promised to meet someone today,
go home safely.</font>

166
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,439
<font color=#FFFF00>The release process is already done.</font>

167
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't believe this.</font>

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,312
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure it was hard.</font>

169
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,437
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it.</font>

170
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:15,624
<font color=#FFFF00>Just stay in my room.</font>

171
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't go upstairs.</font>

172
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:24,717
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

173
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,040
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something I have to check.</font>

174
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,515
<font color=#FFFF00>On the day of Father's birthday party...</font>

175
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,327
<font color=#FFFF00>the canopy fell on top of him.</font>

176
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:43,501
<font color=#FFFF00>Why bring that up all of a sudden?</font>

177
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:46,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin showed me a video clip.</font>

178
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,047
<font color=#FFFF00>And there was a man in that video.</font>

179
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,544
<font color=#FFFF00>He was doing something to the canopy.</font>

180
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,771
<font color=#FFFF00>We found out pretty easily who he is.</font>

181
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,288
<font color=#FFFF00>He was Father's trainer for his physical
therapy sessions.</font>

182
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Why'd he do that?</font>

183
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,912
<font color=#FFFF00>He said...</font>

184
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I put him up to it.</font>

185
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:10,749
<font color=#FFFF00>He said I told him to hurt Park Bok-ja
on purpose.</font>

186
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,991
<font color=#FFFF00>See? Why would you do such a thing, Joo-mi?</font>

187
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:18,022
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

188
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you telling me this?</font>

189
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it too late anyways?</font>

190
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,015
<font color=#FFFF00>How can those words come out of your mouth?</font>

191
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,522
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the one who did it!</font>

192
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,522
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a college professor!</font>

193
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,139
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you so naive?</font>

194
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Or just dumb?</font>

195
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:39,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Or you feel so guilty that you've lost
your sense of judgment?</font>

196
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:42,436
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't think I know what you're up to?</font>

197
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,929
<font color=#FFFF00>You're suffocating all the children
of this family.</font>

198
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,140
<font color=#FFFF00>You're trying to control Father.</font>

199
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,585
<font color=#FFFF00>And you're trying to take over
this entire household.</font>

200
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You think it'll really happen?</font>

201
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here, Joo-mi.</font>

202
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe just spending the night at
the station wasn't enough for you.</font>

203
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Look.</font>

204
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:05,671
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a simple matter to turn a misfired
gunshot to attempted murder.</font>

205
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,780
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're gonna threaten, you gotta
do it at the right time and situation.</font>

206
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,357
<font color=#FFFF00>The canopy incident?</font>

207
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:19,019
<font color=#FFFF00>The world isn't concerned about
what is true.</font>

208
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,788
<font color=#FFFF00>What works becomes the truth.</font>

209
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:24,257
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

210
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:29,062
<font color=#FFFF00>You said the trainer himself said that you
told him to do it?</font>

211
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,616
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

212
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,451
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the one who told him to do it!</font>

213
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,346
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how the world is.</font>

214
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,640
<font color=#FFFF00>You should learn, you naive housewife
of a rich family.</font>

215
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,233
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoon Seong-hee.</font>

216
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,312
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Ma'am.</font>

217
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,426
<font color=#FFFF00>You're dating Ah-jin's husband?</font>

218
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess it's pretty common these days.</font>

219
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:38,772
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

220
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:41,093
<font color=#FFFF00>She helped you out so much!</font>

221
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,968
<font color=#FFFF00>This is ridiculous!</font>

222
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,983
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do such a thing,
as a human being?</font>

223
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,607
<font color=#FFFF00>Answer me.</font>

224
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,467
<font color=#FFFF00>It's love.</font>

225
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,101
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't help it.</font>

226
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Love?</font>

227
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:58,187
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought her husband was
that attractive?</font>

228
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:00,634
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough to go against
human decency?</font>

229
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:04,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you wondering why I'm meddling
in your personal affairs?</font>

230
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

231
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,108
<font color=#FFFF00>End it.</font>

232
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't hurt Ah-jin.</font>

233
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd understand.</font>

234
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you in the same boat as I am?</font>

235
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,862
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

236
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,608
<font color=#FFFF00>People have pointed their fingers
at you too, so you know what it's like!</font>

237
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

238
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,842
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

239
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:27,647
<font color=#FFFF00>You think we're in the same bundle?</font>

240
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,343
<font color=#FFFF00>My paintings and my personal life
are separate things.</font>

241
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,679
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a huge difference in class
between you and me.</font>

242
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,593
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you say that!</font>

243
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,271
<font color=#FFFF00>What's so different?</font>

244
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,780
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a mistress too!</font>

245
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:47,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

246
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Mistress?</font>

247
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:54,904
<font color=#FFFF00>Mistress?</font>

248
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Kim!</font>

249
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Kim!</font>

250
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Ma'am.</font>

251
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Take down all of Yoon Seong-hee's
paintings.</font>

252
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:06,741
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

253
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you not hear me?</font>

254
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Take down all of her six paintings here.</font>

255
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am, I apologize.</font>

256
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,749
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what I meant...</font>

257
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:16,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Take them down now, and take off
the frames right away.</font>

258
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,787
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

259
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,876
<font color=#FFFF00>The famous Japanese collector Morinake
is here.</font>

260
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,163
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

261
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:24,851
<font color=#FFFF00>When did she come?</font>

262
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:27,272
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she just wanted to take a look
quietly.</font>

263
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,132
<font color=#FFFF00>This is amazing!</font>

264
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:33,890
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I describe this painting...</font>

265
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,757
<font color=#FFFF00>It's indescribably perfect!</font>

266
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:42,694
<font color=#FFFF00>There's this sense of pains of war
that are implicitly shown in this.</font>

267
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,718
<font color=#FFFF00>It gives off such a strong feeling
beyond measure.</font>

268
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:50,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to purchase this, at any cost.</font>

269
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:56,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey?</font>

270
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:59,952
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been wanting to study these days.</font>

271
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,960
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that's how I can help you, too.</font>

272
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,904
<font color=#FFFF00>That's good! Study as much as you want.</font>

273
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:13,218
<font color=#FFFF00>There's an MBA program in Korea University,
I heard it's the best in the country.</font>

274
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:18,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I can register there but I need to be part
of a board of the directors somewhere.</font>

275
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,326
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I know that.</font>

276
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:23,818
<font color=#FFFF00>So I was wondering...</font>

277
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:31,413
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I be given some sort of an official
position at your company?</font>

278
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that's not so hard.</font>

279
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Study hard, I'll support you all the way.</font>

280
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:41,069
<font color=#FFFF00>I was good in school when I was little,</font>

281
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:44,483
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd pick up 12 things if someone
taught me just 1 thing!</font>

282
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,007
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I can tell.</font>

283
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:47,608
<font color=#FFFF00>You're definitely a smart one.</font>

284
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell them at work today as soon
as I get there, go ahead and register.</font>

285
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,444
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, I will.</font>

286
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:57,874
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so adorable.</font>

287
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,608
<font color=#FFFF00>You make me feel so shy
this early in the morning.</font>

288
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,218
<font color=#FFFF00>This room's perfect for me to use
as my studio!</font>

289
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,522
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so wide and big!</font>

290
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I love it!</font>

291
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Perfect, use it then.</font>

292
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see the bedroom now.</font>

293
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,007
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes!</font>

294
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,374
<font color=#FFFF00>This way.</font>

295
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,210
<font color=#FFFF00>It's such a nice room!</font>

296
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,585
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while since I've been
in a newly-wed's house.</font>

297
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,843
<font color=#FFFF00>I was told that I'd have great fortunes
this year.</font>

298
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:38,827
<font color=#FFFF00>The one who bought my painting today
is the wife of a conglomerate in Japan.</font>

299
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,546
<font color=#FFFF00>She known to have great taste
in art!</font>

300
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,234
<font color=#FFFF00>What an honor for me! Someone talented
like you is in love with me!</font>

301
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,593
<font color=#FFFF00>All these magical things are happening
in my life after I've met you.</font>

302
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:51,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Well technically, it's because of Ah-jin,
not me.</font>

303
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,092
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so clueless.</font>

304
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:55,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Or you're just that naive.</font>

305
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:58,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone told me that I'm so innocent
and not calculative,</font>

306
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:58,882
<font color=#FFFF00>that's why she likes me.</font>

307
00:16:58,898 --> 00:16:59,601
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said that?</font>

308
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,913
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin.</font>

309
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong-hee! Wait for me!</font>

310
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,804
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been too long since you called me.</font>

311
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,851
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been waiting for the right timing.</font>

312
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, look at you!</font>

313
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:27,046
<font color=#FFFF00>We've known each other for a long time.</font>

314
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:30,362
<font color=#FFFF00>When you first came to that foster care...</font>

315
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:33,812
<font color=#FFFF00>You were just crying, a 3-year-old.
I felt so bad for you.</font>

316
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I saved my own food to feed you.</font>

317
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,890
<font color=#FFFF00>When I got hired as the bookkeeper
at a big business,</font>

318
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:46,194
<font color=#FFFF00>I got you hired as the owner's driver.</font>

319
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you telling me this now?</font>

320
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:52,304
<font color=#FFFF00>7 years ago, we took company funds
for ourselves,</font>

321
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:55,952
<font color=#FFFF00>and I took all the blame.
What did you tell me then?</font>

322
00:17:56,757 --> 00:18:00,273
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you'd pay me back for
what I did for you, right?</font>

323
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, I did.</font>

324
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:09,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I was finally released from prison but
couldn't find a job.</font>

325
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:11,717
<font color=#FFFF00>So I had no choice...</font>

326
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,382
<font color=#FFFF00>To work at a hostess bar.</font>

327
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,291
<font color=#FFFF00>I really thought about...</font>

328
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:21,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Finding you and killing you.</font>

329
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,217
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about that.</font>

330
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:30,241
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought at least one of us
should survive to help the other.</font>

331
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:32,928
<font color=#FFFF00>But for some reason...</font>

332
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:35,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't hate you.</font>

333
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:40,811
<font color=#FFFF00>That day...</font>

334
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:47,054
<font color=#FFFF00>You made me a bowl of ramen,
with some egg in it.</font>

335
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,311
<font color=#FFFF00>And for some odd reason...</font>

336
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,421
<font color=#FFFF00>The ramen felt like it was
your sincere heart.</font>

337
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,150
<font color=#FFFF00>As if you were saying,
"I'm sorry."</font>

338
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,290
<font color=#FFFF00>And you gave me all the money you had
in your wallet, 80 dollars.</font>

339
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:07,834
<font color=#FFFF00>That day...</font>

340
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgave you.</font>

341
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,226
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I found you
such a huge chance!</font>

342
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,428
<font color=#FFFF00>You know...</font>

343
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I really hope you're a loyal person.</font>

344
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,713
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll make sure to take care of you.</font>

345
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:31,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Show me that you're loyal.</font>

346
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:33,175
<font color=#FFFF00>What more do you want from me?</font>

347
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Finish off what you started.</font>

348
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,362
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't get this button in...</font>

349
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong-soo.</font>

350
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:13,137
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not see each other for a while.</font>

351
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:14,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

352
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,764
<font color=#FFFF00>My husband's released
from the hospital.</font>

353
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,459
<font color=#FFFF00>He got better quicker than I thought.</font>

354
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:19,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he was supposed to stay
there for 12 weeks.</font>

355
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,956
<font color=#FFFF00>He was an athlete before,
he healed faster.</font>

356
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,936
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't see each other just because
he's out of the hospital?</font>

357
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pregnant.</font>

358
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:41,715
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you said you couldn't.</font>

359
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

360
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,369
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I thought.</font>

361
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:51,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- When did you find out?
- A few days ago.</font>

362
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,878
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to ask whose child it is?</font>

363
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

364
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,307
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess we'll find out after
the child is born.</font>

365
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,009
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going first.</font>

366
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,730
<font color=#FFFF00>You seemed angry while shopping.</font>

367
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,033
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

368
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,853
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyo-joo.</font>

369
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:25,878
<font color=#FFFF00>My husband's cheating on me.</font>

370
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,182
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no!</font>

371
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,081
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

372
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I kill him?</font>

373
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:34,947
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you go through it?</font>

374
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:40,478
<font color=#FFFF00>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</font>

375
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,346
<font color=#FFFF00>I got a boyfriend of my own.</font>

376
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,705
<font color=#FFFF00>But you know what's funny?</font>

377
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:50,456
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you have a boyfriend, you understand
where your husband's coming from.</font>

378
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:52,252
<font color=#FFFF00>Your heart flutters.</font>

379
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:54,798
<font color=#FFFF00>A young man...</font>

380
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:58,922
<font color=#FFFF00>The balance of hormones
he provides for you...</font>

381
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:02,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Is not something you can buy with money.</font>

382
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,908
<font color=#FFFF00>So?</font>

383
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:04,995
<font color=#FFFF00>I should cheat, too?</font>

384
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,253
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on,</font>

385
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,315
<font color=#FFFF00>that's not what I'm saying.</font>

386
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:12,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I actually have another son,
an older one.</font>

387
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,580
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

388
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,408
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone knows.</font>

389
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,378
<font color=#FFFF00>Raising a child who's ill...</font>

390
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:21,542
<font color=#FFFF00>And my husband's cheating on me...</font>

391
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,175
<font color=#FFFF00>And now it's my turn somehow?</font>

392
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,831
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't talk about the kids, it makes me
feel bad.</font>

393
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,096
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly,</font>

394
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,885
<font color=#FFFF00>the mothers need to be at ease
and not be angry</font>

395
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,717
<font color=#FFFF00>to raise the children well.</font>

396
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,796
<font color=#FFFF00>How will I see her face tomorrow?</font>

397
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:45,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You're meeting her tomorrow?</font>

398
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:47,883
<font color=#FFFF00>It's our brunch meeting tomorrow.</font>

399
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,580
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're saying...</font>

400
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:56,415
<font color=#FFFF00>It's one of the members of our group?</font>

401
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,237
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Jang is cheating with one of us?</font>

402
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,009
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin.</font>

403
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,361
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin.</font>

404
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin, are you OK?</font>

405
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,151
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

406
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:20,940
<font color=#FFFF00>This makes me feel better.</font>

407
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,455
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still at it?</font>

408
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,037
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I doing tomorrow?</font>

409
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,096
<font color=#FFFF00>You have your brunch gathering tomorrow.</font>

410
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:32,206
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I have to? I don't feel like it.</font>

411
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,423
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello!</font>

412
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:03,025
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?</font>

413
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,173
<font color=#FFFF00>You're early!</font>

414
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,626
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello there!</font>

415
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,313
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello!</font>

416
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,186
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you kill someone with this?</font>

417
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,513
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying, don't worry.</font>

418
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:34,142
<font color=#FFFF00>I think this will be the last time I come
to this brunch gathering.</font>

419
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,087
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm selling the after school place.</font>

420
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,634
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to the conclusion that my belief
in education doesn't fit.</font>

421
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:40,884
<font color=#FFFF00>I resign.</font>

422
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,782
<font color=#FFFF00>We feel bad about that for some reason...</font>

423
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:46,212
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, don't say that.</font>

424
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you be our kids' private tutor?</font>

425
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:50,911
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll compensate you well.</font>

426
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:52,884
<font color=#FFFF00>Which ones?</font>

427
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,134
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean, who?</font>

428
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Soo-min, Jeong-hyun, and Ji-hoo.
Three of them.</font>

429
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:01,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Why'd you leave out Yoon-jae, my son?</font>

430
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should you be included?</font>

431
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:05,962
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm baffled!</font>

432
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,361
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

433
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,892
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

434
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:12,014
<font color=#FFFF00>You actually don't belong here
in our group.</font>

435
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,891
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly speaking, Yoon-jae's not
even your real son!</font>

436
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,204
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi-oak, aren't you a little too harsh?</font>

437
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,923
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you trying to do here?</font>

438
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,189
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say such a thing?</font>

439
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:24,439
<font color=#FFFF00>You feel like you're actually part of the
high class of Gangnam?</font>

440
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,704
<font color=#FFFF00>You came from nothing, and you're
still nothing!</font>

441
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:30,315
<font color=#FFFF00>You think you can just take in another
person's child and act as if</font>

442
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,487
<font color=#FFFF00>you're the actual mother? You think
that can alleviate your social status?</font>

443
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:34,948
<font color=#FFFF00>No way!</font>

444
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:38,198
<font color=#FFFF00>A dirty wipe is still a dirty wipe,
even after you wash it!</font>

445
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,104
<font color=#FFFF00>A dirty wipe?</font>

446
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:43,612
<font color=#FFFF00>Gi-oak, let's not do that here.</font>

447
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:46,690
<font color=#FFFF00>You two should meet and talk
privately, stop what you're doing.</font>

448
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:49,004
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right, this isn't so proper.</font>

449
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,331
<font color=#FFFF00>You used to make announcements
at the horse race tracks?</font>

450
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:53,776
<font color=#FFFF00>And you told us you were a newscaster
at a regional TV station?</font>

451
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,175
<font color=#FFFF00>You're just a dirty liar!</font>

452
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:56,854
<font color=#FFFF00>You're calling me a liar?</font>

453
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You've got such thick skin.</font>

454
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,276
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's calling whom a liar?</font>

455
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:05,120
<font color=#FFFF00>You were a pharmacist when you used to
work with your husband?</font>

456
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:08,683
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys started dating as a doctor
and a pharmacist at a college hospital?</font>

457
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,603
<font color=#FFFF00>Which college was that?</font>

458
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you go to a pharmacy school
in the Philippines?</font>

459
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,229
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

460
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:19,175
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't think I'd find out that
you went to high school and college</font>

461
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:22,612
<font color=#FFFF00>in the Philippines? And anyone with
some money can go to a junior college!</font>

462
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:24,901
<font color=#FFFF00>Pharmacist, that's hilarious!</font>

463
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,065
<font color=#FFFF00>You've got no conscience.</font>

464
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:29,878
<font color=#FFFF00>Who'd you hear it from? That I went to
college in the Philippines?</font>

465
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure everyone knows.</font>

466
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,643
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you all know?</font>

467
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:33,901
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, stop!</font>

468
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me!</font>

469
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,877
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't be eating today, please
cancel our orders.</font>

470
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,339
<font color=#FFFF00>They already started cooking.</font>

471
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:40,784
<font color=#FFFF00>Did my husband tell you that?</font>

472
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,106
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what he told you?
Say it!</font>

473
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,276
<font color=#FFFF00>Is my husband...</font>

474
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Good in bed?</font>

475
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of her! What are you doing?</font>

476
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:51,112
<font color=#FFFF00>What was it?</font>

477
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:54,011
<font color=#FFFF00>You wanted a nice guy since you're
always beat up by your own husband?</font>

478
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,300
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you hit on him?</font>

479
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:56,939
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah! I did hit on him!</font>

480
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:01,003
<font color=#FFFF00>He is  nice, and he told me he loves me
to death, so I let him have me.</font>

481
00:27:02,964 --> 00:27:04,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyung-hee! Get out of here!</font>

482
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,284
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

483
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:07,433
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it!</font>

484
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:10,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it! You should be ashamed of yourself!</font>

485
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,627
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't right!</font>

486
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,612
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to stop, too.</font>

487
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,745
<font color=#FFFF00>You've got no right to judge me.</font>

488
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,706
<font color=#FFFF00>No, right?</font>

489
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,808
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

490
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:19,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You let him have you because
he loves you to death?</font>

491
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:23,433
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah! He said I smell like sakura to him.</font>

492
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,526
<font color=#FFFF00>He said I make him feel
like a child again.</font>

493
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:27,104
<font color=#FFFF00>I made him to want to be a man!</font>

494
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:19,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pregnant!</font>

495
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:49,897
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That day...</i></font>

496
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,507
<font color=#FFFF00><i>She saw the true reality of herself
at that last brunch.</i></font>

497
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:56,007
<font color=#FFFF00><i>And...</i></font>

498
00:28:56,055 --> 00:29:01,875
<font color=#FFFF00><i>She also realized what she had to do,
and what she must not do.</i></font>

499
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:05,429
<font color=#FFFF00>The Global Education Institute of
Korea University</font>

500
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:10,726
<font color=#FFFF00>is a very influential gathering that can
change risks into opportunities</font>

501
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:15,429
<font color=#FFFF00>as we raise global leaders of today.</font>

502
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:20,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

503
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:23,226
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Han Min-ki, I'm the CEO
of MK Capital.</font>

504
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Park Bok...</font>

505
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:29,281
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Park... Ji-young.</font>

506
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, Park Ji-young?</font>

507
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,359
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes.
- Do you have a business card?</font>

508
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,088
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you one next time.</font>

509
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,468
<font color=#FFFF00>This wine is from Tuscany, Italy,
from the region of Chianti.</font>

510
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,108
<font color=#FFFF00>It's made by Zonin.</font>

511
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:53,890
<font color=#FFFF00>It's called, "Castello d'Albola Chianti
Classico Riserva."</font>

512
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,952
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a mouthful, right?</font>

513
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:58,843
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we try saying it all together?</font>

514
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:00,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Castello d'Albola.</font>

515
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:05,041
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The people in the high class
studied continuously.</i></font>

516
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,304
<font color=#FFFF00><i>In order to hold on to their position...</i></font>

517
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,257
<font color=#FFFF00><i>They put in the utmost effort.</i></font>

518
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:14,054
<font color=#FFFF00><i>And their effort was at a different level
than the effort of those in </i></font>

519
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:16,242
<font color=#FFFF00><i>the lower class, who struggled to survive.</i></font>

520
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,491
<font color=#FFFF00><i>They believed.</i></font>

521
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:22,492
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Even if life as they know it
were to start to break,</i></font>

522
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:25,781
<font color=#FFFF00><i>their effort in learning can
sustain their lives and positions.</i></font>

523
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,515
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize, please continue.</font>

524
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it your child?</font>

525
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:06,843
<font color=#FFFF00>No, right?</font>

526
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,608
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

527
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:09,812
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

528
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know either!
It's driving me crazy too!</font>

529
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:13,297
<font color=#FFFF00>What drives you crazy?</font>

530
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,156
<font color=#FFFF00>Because it might be your child?</font>

531
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:16,437
<font color=#FFFF00>Or because it might not be?</font>

532
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:17,531
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what I mean.</font>

533
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,171
<font color=#FFFF00>You bastard!</font>

534
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,780
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

535
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,867
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do this to me?</font>

536
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:25,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, I was going to end it.</font>

537
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you love her?</font>

538
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:28,984
<font color=#FFFF00>Love, whatever.</font>

539
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:32,086
<font color=#FFFF00>Then? You weren't even in love with her?</font>

540
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:34,836
<font color=#FFFF00>And you cheated with her, someone you met
through your kids?</font>

541
00:31:34,915 --> 00:31:37,047
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've just slept with someone
who works at a bar.</font>

542
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:38,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't that have been better,
so I won't find out?</font>

543
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I first met her as a patient here.</font>

544
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I was glad to see her again
at the parents' meeting.</font>

545
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,081
<font color=#FFFF00>You were glad to see her?</font>

546
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you hearing yourself?</font>

547
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:54,039
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk at home later, this is
a hospital! It's not good to do this here.</font>

548
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:55,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, now you're feeling embarrassed?</font>

549
00:31:55,852 --> 00:31:58,133
<font color=#FFFF00>Trust me, I'm holding back because
we're here.</font>

550
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to rip you apart!</font>

551
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:05,664
<font color=#FFFF00>But you need to talk to the patients
so we can continue to live in a nice house.</font>

552
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:08,070
<font color=#FFFF00>So our kids can continue to go to
a nice school!</font>

553
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,453
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what it is!</font>

554
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:11,086
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just some money-making worm
to you!</font>

555
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,273
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I to you? What am I
to the family?</font>

556
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,812
<font color=#FFFF00>I do the same surgery everyday,</font>

557
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,016
<font color=#FFFF00>I studied so hard to get into
medical school just to do this.</font>

558
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:20,164
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I work so hard to bring you money
for you and the kids.</font>

559
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:23,168
<font color=#FFFF00>So at least let me get away
with this much.</font>

560
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,758
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll end it here, you can leave.</font>

561
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you dropping the suit
all of a sudden?</font>

562
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,953
<font color=#FFFF00>If a husband beats his wife, can the
wife report it or sue him for it?</font>

563
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes of course.</font>

564
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:51,430
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's a different department,
we won't take the case here.</font>

565
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:04,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at him!</font>

566
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,975
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so rude for having a bit of money.</font>

567
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:09,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure he beat his wife.</font>

568
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:11,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm 100% sure.</font>

569
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:15,835
<font color=#FFFF00>How terrible!</font>

570
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:20,484
<font color=#FFFF00>My baby...</font>

571
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Is OK, right?</font>

572
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:24,257
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, the baby's fine.</font>

573
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Your oldest is in the third grade?</font>

574
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,836
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure he'll be a great brother
since they're a few years apart.</font>

575
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? What happened to your face?</font>

576
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Your wife did this to me.</font>

577
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:56,656
<font color=#FFFF00>Your wife did it, so you pay for it.</font>

578
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,266
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see. She scratched your face
with her nails?</font>

579
00:34:02,383 --> 00:34:03,516
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

580
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:04,625
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a burn mark.</font>

581
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What if they leave scars on my face?</font>

582
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,422
<font color=#FFFF00>They won't.</font>

583
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you medicine for it,
make sure you keep applying it.</font>

584
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,336
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm relieved.</font>

585
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fortunate that you're
a cosmetic surgeon.</font>

586
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:18,701
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

587
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Whom are you saying that to?</font>

588
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:22,585
<font color=#FFFF00>To me?</font>

589
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:24,296
<font color=#FFFF00>Or to your wife?</font>

590
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong-soo.</font>

591
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:30,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you...</font>

592
00:34:30,227 --> 00:34:31,664
<font color=#FFFF00>Take responsibility?</font>

593
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you scared?</font>

594
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,444
<font color=#FFFF00>What responsibility?</font>

595
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:39,773
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not even sure if it's my child yet.</font>

596
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:41,413
<font color=#FFFF00>It's yours.</font>

597
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't sleep with my husband.</font>

598
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

599
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:48,413
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do now?</font>

600
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:00,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful, careful!</font>

601
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:05,719
<font color=#FFFF00>These paintings are so much more expensive
than the furniture, please be careful!</font>

602
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:08,335
<font color=#FFFF00>Careful, careful!</font>

603
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:31,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure if you'd believe me but...</font>

604
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:33,561
<font color=#FFFF00>I like you, Ah-jin.</font>

605
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:36,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

606
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,281
<font color=#FFFF00>It is hard to believe.</font>

607
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we drink?</font>

608
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Many things can happen in life,
in the world.</font>

609
00:35:52,774 --> 00:35:56,305
<font color=#FFFF00>And you have no control over them.</font>

610
00:35:56,414 --> 00:36:00,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, there are actually only a few thing
you can control in life.</font>

611
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,891
<font color=#FFFF00>Is husband one of them?</font>

612
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:12,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you just gonna let him slide?</font>

613
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,871
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what you mean by moving out, right?</font>

614
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:19,453
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't he moving with you?</font>

615
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,133
<font color=#FFFF00>I no longer have Ahn Jae-suk in my life
as my husband.</font>

616
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:25,383
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

617
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,458
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji-hoo should still have a dad.</font>

618
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,968
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he doesn't want a divorce either.</font>

619
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,031
<font color=#FFFF00>He said that in front of his father.</font>

620
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:38,286
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he'd never get a divorce.</font>

621
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:40,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Father know?</font>

622
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:43,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I told him.</font>

623
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,778
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not something we can hide.</font>

624
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:55,155
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with the wine?</font>

625
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,500
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

626
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,164
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should drink with me why...
- Why is she drinking with me instead?</font>

627
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,819
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

628
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:04,000
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Joo-mi.</font>

629
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,616
<font color=#FFFF00>Go on in.</font>

630
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,110
<font color=#FFFF00>We have something to talk about.</font>

631
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,719
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it? Your wife?</font>

632
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:18,601
<font color=#FFFF00>No, my father.</font>

633
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,851
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe my dad! He cheated
on my mom so many times.</font>

634
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,840
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he keep a straight face
and hit me?</font>

635
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:28,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Pick up. We have to have your father
on our side.</font>

636
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Come home at once!</font>

637
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,616
<font color=#FFFF00>You crazy fool!</font>

638
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,601
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't I tell you to break up
with her already?</font>

639
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:44,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know that your mother passed away
because I made her so angry?</font>

640
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,022
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone knows that!</font>

641
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:48,016
<font color=#FFFF00>You grew up watching that,
how can you do the same?</font>

642
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:49,594
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I learned from you,
I can't help it.</font>

643
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,292
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna tear you apart!</font>

644
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:53,406
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the worst person in the world!</font>

645
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:57,062
<font color=#FFFF00>What if Ah-jin becomes ill and
died too? What will you do?</font>

646
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, come on!</font>

647
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:02,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll just get a caregiver and
get married again, like you!</font>

648
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,476
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What did you just say?</font>

649
00:38:05,204 --> 00:38:07,633
<font color=#FFFF00>You've totally gone mad!</font>

650
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:10,562
<font color=#FFFF00>You're just saying whatever
the words you can think of!</font>

651
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:16,281
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Ah-jin is the one who introduced
that cartoonist to you.</font>

652
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,797
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you cheat with her?</font>

653
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,554
<font color=#FFFF00>Father!</font>

654
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,882
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not cartoon, it's pop-art!
I told you many times already.</font>

655
00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:28,500
<font color=#FFFF00>When I cheated on your mother, I did
it on my own.</font>

656
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:30,437
<font color=#FFFF00>And I never got your mother involved.</font>

657
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:32,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I met those women on my own!</font>

658
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,273
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you be so dumb,
even in the way you cheat?</font>

659
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:40,242
<font color=#FFFF00>You need Ah-jin's help
even to cheat on her!</font>

660
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,562
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

661
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,523
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm 100% sure that I can convince you
if we sat down and talk.</font>

662
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:46,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make yourself embarrassed.</font>

663
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:48,773
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to calm down, you're
totally overreacting!</font>

664
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:50,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut up, you bastard!</font>

665
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:53,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving you one week, and
one week only.</font>

666
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:55,273
<font color=#FFFF00>If you continue to date her
after a week...</font>

667
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,328
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll be kicked out from the company
forever!</font>

668
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

669
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:09,937
<font color=#FFFF00>What's his point?</font>

670
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:13,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he telling me to cheat
without any help?</font>

671
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:15,437
<font color=#FFFF00>He's being completely ridiculous!</font>

672
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,726
<font color=#FFFF00>What did he say?</font>

673
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:18,617
<font color=#FFFF00>He's telling me to come home at once,
of course.</font>

674
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,303
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home then.</font>

675
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:21,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

676
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:22,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Just listen to him.</font>

677
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you tell from your stepmother,
what she did to me?</font>

678
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:27,710
<font color=#FFFF00>He's completely angry.</font>

679
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:30,257
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he kicks you out of his company?</font>

680
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:32,163
<font color=#FFFF00>That's too bad then.</font>

681
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:33,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Nonsense!</font>

682
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:35,569
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you think straight?</font>

683
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,578
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

684
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:38,609
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a bit disappointed at you.</font>

685
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:41,265
<font color=#FFFF00>You wouldn't have liked me if I
didn't have any money?</font>

686
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,951
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does that matter?</font>

687
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,796
<font color=#FFFF00>I like you, which means I like everything
that makes up who you are now.</font>

688
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:49,750
<font color=#FFFF00>The answer to your question, if I would
still like you if you had no money,</font>

689
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:51,093
<font color=#FFFF00>is neither yes nor a no.</font>

690
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:52,531
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to grow up.</font>

691
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,664
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're telling me to go back home now?</font>

692
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:57,117
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make things worse.</font>

693
00:39:57,148 --> 00:39:59,093
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to act with more maturity.</font>

694
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,039
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not a 14-year-old teenager!</font>

695
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:02,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

696
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,054
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't have cheated with you
if I acted maturely.</font>

697
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:15,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you which number I hate the most?</font>

698
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,835
<font color=#FFFF00>9.</font>

699
00:40:18,702 --> 00:40:20,101
<font color=#FFFF00>9.</font>

700
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:22,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You know why?</font>

701
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:26,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Starting when I was 9,</font>

702
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:28,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I no longer had a dad.</font>

703
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:32,476
<font color=#FFFF00>My daughter, Ji-hoo...</font>

704
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:37,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want her to hate number 11</font>

705
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:39,233
<font color=#FFFF00>for the same reason.</font>

706
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Getting a divorce doesn't mean Ji-hoo
will not have a dad anymore.</font>

707
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,897
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

708
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:58,026
<font color=#FFFF00>The sense of loss Ji-hoo would feel...</font>

709
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:03,382
<font color=#FFFF00>Is no different from what I felt
when I was 9.</font>

710
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:05,577
<font color=#FFFF00>Perhaps...</font>

711
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:09,776
<font color=#FFFF00>It might even be more painful for her.</font>

712
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,803
<font color=#FFFF00>The sense of loss...</font>

713
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Added with a sense of betrayal.</font>

714
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:17,756
<font color=#FFFF00>So it's even more.</font>

715
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:48,773
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad must've felt bad for me.</font>

716
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:51,539
<font color=#FFFF00>He gave me some money after
throwing me out.</font>

717
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:53,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Then are you...</font>

718
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:57,984
<font color=#FFFF00>Planning on staying here forever until
Mr. Ahn gives a big chunk of his money?</font>

719
00:41:58,095 --> 00:41:59,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course!</font>

720
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:02,203
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be like wet tissue stuck
on the bathroom floor.</font>

721
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,593
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going anywhere!</font>

722
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,304
<font color=#FFFF00>How much do you want
for you to leave?</font>

723
00:42:05,352 --> 00:42:06,593
<font color=#FFFF00>2 million in cash.</font>

724
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:08,835
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll leave if he gives me that much.</font>

725
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:12,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Inheritance and stock shares
are a separate matter though.</font>

726
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:15,203
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, hey!</font>

727
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:19,073
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you draw some hot bathwater for me
before you leave?</font>

728
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:20,983
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it on your own.</font>

729
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, come on.</font>

730
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Even the hired hand ignores
my request.</font>

731
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:38,631
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sleeping?</font>

732
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,319
<font color=#FFFF00>Who must this be?</font>

733
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:13,295
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone, come out here!</font>

734
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:15,646
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out!</font>

735
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:17,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are they?</font>

736
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,061
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

737
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and tell us.</font>

738
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:34,546
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been circling around
this house for a while.</font>

739
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,514
<font color=#FFFF00>I actually came here...</font>

740
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,593
<font color=#FFFF00>To apologize to you, Mr. Ahn.</font>

741
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,295
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of an apology?</font>

742
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:46,565
<font color=#FFFF00>On your birthday party...</font>

743
00:43:46,984 --> 00:43:49,125
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about how the canopy fell on you.</font>

744
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,257
<font color=#FFFF00>I was there when that happened.</font>

745
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You were?</font>

746
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you say hi to me?</font>

747
00:43:57,156 --> 00:44:00,823
<font color=#FFFF00>I was asked to hurt Park Bok-ja,
who is your wife now.</font>

748
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:06,781
<font color=#FFFF00>I was paid cash.</font>

749
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:08,812
<font color=#FFFF00>And I did what I was asked to do.</font>

750
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,179
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

751
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,921
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you talking about?</font>

752
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,187
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's keep listening to what
he has to say.</font>

753
00:44:15,594 --> 00:44:17,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I have some debt under my name.</font>

754
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:22,007
<font color=#FFFF00>And I agreed to do it, though I knew
I shouldn't have.</font>

755
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:23,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mr. Ahn.</font>

756
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh man...</font>

757
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:28,546
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what you're talking about.</font>

758
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:30,937
<font color=#FFFF00>One day, your first daughter-in-law...</font>

759
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,169
<font color=#FFFF00>This woman, sitting right here...</font>

760
00:44:34,031 --> 00:44:36,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Came to my gym and gave me this
envelop full of cash.</font>

761
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:38,351
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

762
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:43,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Father! This isn't true!</font>

763
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk after he's done.</font>

764
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:47,531
<font color=#FFFF00>She told me she hates someone
enough to kill her.</font>

765
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,546
<font color=#FFFF00>And she needed help to get rid of her.</font>

766
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by "get rid of her"?</font>

767
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Just...</font>

768
00:44:55,132 --> 00:44:56,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Just so that she won't be a caregiver...</font>

769
00:44:57,046 --> 00:44:58,695
<font color=#FFFF00>Do what to her, to stop her?</font>

770
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut your mouth!</font>

771
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:02,356
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never even met you before!</font>

772
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:04,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, I'm being framed!</font>

773
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,234
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't me!</font>

774
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,757
<font color=#FFFF00>She asked me to hurt Park Bok-ja.</font>

775
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,625
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

776
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,171
<font color=#FFFF00>This is completely shocking!</font>

777
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,517
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt so guilty, I did it
all because of money.</font>

778
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,233
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

779
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,131
<font color=#FFFF00>He's putting on a show!</font>

780
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:21,398
<font color=#FFFF00>He's got to be on her side!</font>

781
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:22,960
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the one that planned all this!</font>

782
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:24,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep your mouth shut!</font>

783
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:26,273
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you make up a story like that?</font>

784
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:27,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Joo-mi...</font>

785
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:31,093
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how desperate you feel,
you can't just make up a lie like that!</font>

786
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:33,937
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, I'm OK...</font>

787
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:36,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make a scene.</font>

788
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:40,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just send him home and talk
within the family.</font>

789
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,742
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

790
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:45,471
<font color=#FFFF00>You're really doing this?</font>

791
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,358
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't true, Father!</font>

792
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:53,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut your mouth!</font>

793
00:45:58,148 --> 00:45:59,656
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

794
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

795
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:04,726
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a huge mess over there!</font>

796
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:05,695
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened this time?</font>

797
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:08,609
<font color=#FFFF00>Joo-mi, Jae-suk, and Woon-kyu
are about to be kicked out.</font>

798
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:11,226
<font color=#FFFF00>But Ah-jin, do you really
have to move?</font>

799
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:12,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

800
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,304
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't have a place to go
after they're kicked out.</font>

801
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,382
<font color=#FFFF00>They should stay at the place
you bought.</font>

802
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:18,445
<font color=#FFFF00>No, not that house.</font>

803
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:20,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, it's not true.</font>

804
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:21,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Absolutely not!</font>

805
00:46:21,938 --> 00:46:22,953
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I do that?</font>

806
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
<font color=#FFFF00>The one received money confessed
himself!</font>

807
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:27,304
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you still be lying?</font>

808
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:28,679
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out!</font>

809
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- We'll just leave then!
- Are you crazy?</font>

810
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,257
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what I went through in this house
while you were gone?</font>

811
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of Woon-kyu, our son!</font>

812
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:38,304
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

813
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:40,693
<font color=#FFFF00>Woon-kyu's a senior in high school.</font>

814
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:43,290
<font color=#FFFF00>You like your grandson, don't you?</font>

815
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of him, at least!</font>

816
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:46,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

817
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:48,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay here until Woon-kyu graduates.</font>

818
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:49,664
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

819
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Just until he takes his
college entrance exam.</font>

820
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:54,179
<font color=#FFFF00>Then leave.</font>

821
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see anyone.</font>

822
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Father...</font>

823
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,546
<font color=#FFFF00>He was so mad that Ah-jin might feel hurt
from her husband's cheating.</font>

824
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:20,085
<font color=#FFFF00>But he doesn't even want to listen
to a single word I say, and kicks me out.</font>

825
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,209
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be it!</font>

826
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:26,694
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all because of you!</font>

827
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know that?</font>

828
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:56,960
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the sales report.</font>

829
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,914
<font color=#FFFF00>No! I'm gonna leave, not you.</font>

830
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that's true...</font>

831
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:09,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit.</font>

832
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:11,256
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

833
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:16,882
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you all the way here?</font>

834
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:19,714
<font color=#FFFF00>I just came back from the place we bought.</font>

835
00:48:20,156 --> 00:48:21,015
<font color=#FFFF00>There? Why?</font>

836
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to move there.</font>

837
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Why, all of a sudden?</font>

838
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:25,710
<font color=#FFFF00>"All of a sudden"?</font>

839
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,039
<font color=#FFFF00>I actually want to move out
of the country if I could.</font>

840
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:31,086
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stay like this, at least
for Ji-hoo.</font>

841
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:36,562
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll think of it as a new beginning, and
start my life over in that house.</font>

842
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:37,531
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

843
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:40,901
<font color=#FFFF00>The password was changed.</font>

844
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I rented it out.</font>

845
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,031
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

846
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:48,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea you were planning on
moving there.</font>

847
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:50,879
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said you can rent it out?</font>

848
00:48:50,906 --> 00:48:52,573
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you out of your mind?</font>

849
00:48:56,773 --> 00:48:58,373
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

850
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth.</font>

851
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,913
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

852
00:49:14,758 --> 00:49:16,546
<font color=#FFFF00>You're gonna live with whom
in that house?</font>

853
00:49:16,563 --> 00:49:17,766
<font color=#FFFF00>You're terrible!</font>

854
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin, don't kill me!</font>

855
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am, I had nothing to do with this!</font>

856
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:07,015
<font color=#FFFF00>You look terrible, what's wrong?</font>

857
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Attorney Kang here?</font>

858
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,334
<font color=#FFFF00>He's at the court.</font>

859
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,382
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a case I wanted to
discuss with him.</font>

860
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,867
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a house we bought, and it's
under my husband's name.</font>

861
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,475
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I change that?</font>

862
00:50:30,836 --> 00:50:37,445
<font color=#FFFF00>So in that house, my husband and
another...</font>

863
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,867
<font color=#FFFF00>And another woman are living there.</font>

864
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,886
<font color=#FFFF00>The ownership of the house...</font>

865
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,100
<font color=#FFFF00>So I mean...</font>

866
00:50:54,328 --> 00:50:55,928
<font color=#FFFF00>That house...</font>

867
00:50:57,398 --> 00:51:03,062
<font color=#FFFF00>We planned on living there with
my daughter, all three of us...</font>

868
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,334
<font color=#FFFF00>Please be calm.</font>

869
00:51:20,648 --> 00:51:22,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

870
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:25,226
<font color=#FFFF00>I just feel so frustrated.</font>

871
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,507
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to ask him how to deal with this...</font>

872
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:32,679
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back another time.</font>

873
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,851
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

874
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:16,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

875
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:18,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin!</font>

876
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't get up.</font>

877
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,953
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm OK.</font>

878
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:46,421
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not OK, I'll
be the judge of that.</font>

879
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:49,679
<font color=#FFFF00>The doctor said you need to go through
more testing, we're moving you into a room.</font>

880
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:51,093
<font color=#FFFF00>You need some rest.</font>

881
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,085
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need.</font>

882
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,031
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to leave.</font>

883
00:52:53,063 --> 00:52:58,203
<font color=#FFFF00>You can come to a hospital on your own
will, but you can't just leave on your own.</font>

884
00:52:58,281 --> 00:52:59,881
<font color=#FFFF00>I gotta get going.</font>

885
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to the doctor, Mate.</font>

886
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

887
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:13,501
<font color=#FFFF00>I must've been too awesome and cool.</font>

888
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,242
<font color=#FFFF00>You fainted at the sight of me!</font>

889
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:17,476
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

890
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:20,507
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad that I made you faint.</font>

891
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,600
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't be sorry.</font>

892
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:29,734
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I make a phone call?</font>

893
00:53:30,078 --> 00:53:31,406
<font color=#FFFF00>OK, Ah-jin.</font>

894
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:34,617
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about Ji-hoo,
I'll take good care of her.</font>

895
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:37,502
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? What'd she say?</font>

896
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:41,523
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin's not feeling well, she's
at the hospital.</font>

897
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:43,007
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

898
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,737
<font color=#FFFF00>So she's not coming home?</font>

899
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:45,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she hurting?</font>

900
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:48,877
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you think?
It's her heart.</font>

901
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:50,717
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on here?</font>

902
00:53:51,805 --> 00:53:52,921
<font color=#FFFF00>Jin-hee!</font>

903
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,343
<font color=#FFFF00>I finished my homework.</font>

904
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,937
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji-hoo, go to bed early today.</font>

905
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:58,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji-hoo?</font>

906
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:02,339
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know if your mom and dad
are doing OK these days?</font>

907
00:54:02,758 --> 00:54:03,843
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

908
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I was just wondering if you
heard something...</font>

909
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:07,343
<font color=#FFFF00>No, nothing.</font>

910
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,781
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know, is your dad cheating
on your mom or something?</font>

911
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,585
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you're doing?</font>

912
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,848
<font color=#FFFF00>It just doesn't make sense to me.</font>

913
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:16,781
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin's in the hospital all of a sudden...</font>

914
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:20,117
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom's at a hospital?</font>

915
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,069
<font color=#FFFF00>- No...
- Yeah.</font>

916
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,015
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you? I told you
to hire someone.</font>

917
00:54:34,156 --> 00:54:37,046
<font color=#FFFF00>You were trying to move things
on your own, and now you're sick!</font>

918
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,492
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not from moving.</font>

919
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:43,161
<font color=#FFFF00>It's from getting beat up by your
stepmother, I'm just feeling it now.</font>

920
00:54:45,664 --> 00:54:47,264
<font color=#FFFF00>Pick it up!</font>

921
00:54:48,477 --> 00:54:50,077
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Father.</font>

922
00:54:51,859 --> 00:54:53,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, it's Ji-hoo.</font>

923
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:03,593
<font color=#FFFF00>You're done talking on the phone?</font>

924
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

925
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,838
<font color=#FFFF00>You've never been hospitalized before?</font>

926
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:13,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I have, it's not that.</font>

927
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:18,851
<font color=#FFFF00>I got married when I was 25.</font>

928
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:22,187
<font color=#FFFF00>I got in a car accident on our way
to our honeymoon.</font>

929
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:25,348
<font color=#FFFF00>That's when my wife passed away.</font>

930
00:55:25,852 --> 00:55:29,585
<font color=#FFFF00>And I was in a coma for 2 years, staying
at a hospital.</font>

931
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:31,601
<font color=#FFFF00>I was in a vegetative state.</font>

932
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:35,693
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hospitalized in that state
the whole time.</font>

933
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:39,351
<font color=#FFFF00>The lost 2 years of my life.</font>

934
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Those 2 years...</font>

935
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Were just gone, like that.</font>

936
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,045
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

937
00:55:47,617 --> 00:55:49,217
<font color=#FFFF00>I do remember.</font>

938
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,336
<font color=#FFFF00>While I was unconscious,</font>

939
00:55:52,828 --> 00:56:00,093
<font color=#FFFF00>I do remember a thought I was holding onto,
subconsciously.</font>

940
00:56:02,398 --> 00:56:03,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I must...</font>

941
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:04,763
<font color=#FFFF00>Live.</font>

942
00:56:06,477 --> 00:56:08,077
<font color=#FFFF00>At least for my wife.</font>

943
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,069
<font color=#FFFF00>I must live.</font>

944
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:14,193
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know she had
already left this world.</font>

945
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,067
<font color=#FFFF00>That earnest heart of wanting to survive
for someone else...</font>

946
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:23,709
<font color=#FFFF00>Brought me back to life.</font>

947
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:28,031
<font color=#FFFF00>You, too...</font>

948
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:31,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about whom you need to protect.</font>

949
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:37,936
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me your hand.</font>

950
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:48,984
<font color=#FFFF00>This paper crane will fly away,
turned in to a real crane.</font>

951
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:01,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be right back.</font>

952
00:57:01,938 --> 00:57:04,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to sign for your admittance.</font>

953
00:57:35,594 --> 00:57:37,194
<font color=#FFFF00>You just have one left.</font>

954
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:39,331
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do with Ah-jin?</font>

955
00:57:54,492 --> 00:57:56,826
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello?
- You're in the hospital?</font>

956
00:57:57,547 --> 00:57:58,984
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

957
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,476
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you now?</font>

958
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,039
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm home, of course.</font>

959
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,234
<font color=#FFFF00>Which home?</font>

960
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:04,873
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course it's...</font>

961
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:06,561
<font color=#FFFF00>That house.</font>

962
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:09,782
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because what I said earlier?</font>

963
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:12,461
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Ah-jin!</font>

964
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,367
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't faint so easily like that.</font>

965
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:17,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji-hoo's crying so hard right now.</font>

966
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,054
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you making our daughter worry?</font>

967
00:58:21,547 --> 00:58:22,507
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah-jin.</font>

968
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I do love you.</font>

969
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:32,791
<font color=#FFFF00>It is a problem that you're not
the only one I love at the moment.</font>

970
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,187
<font color=#FFFF00>But still...</font>

971
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:36,726
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't divorce you.</font>

972
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Just be cool about it.</font>

973
00:58:38,469 --> 00:58:41,269
<font color=#FFFF00>Just acknowledge our current relationship.</font>

974
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:51,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't leave Ji-hoo alone at home.</font>

975
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:53,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home.</font>

976
00:58:53,227 --> 00:58:54,827
<font color=#FFFF00>My sister's there.</font>

977
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:57,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be like that, please.</font>

978
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:00,006
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to Ji-hoo's side.</font>

979
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:01,578
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm asking you.</font>

980
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:03,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong-hee's sick!</font>

981
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:12,452
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

982
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,757
<font color=#FFFF00>She keeps hanging up on me.</font>

983
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:19,203
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a bad habit.</font>

984
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:29,046
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I love you so much! Fight on!</font>

985
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be sick!</font>

986
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:39,834
<font color=#FFFF00>Ahn Jae-suk...</font>

987
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:44,453
<font color=#FFFF00>You're out of my life, forever!</font>

988
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:48,039
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do with the
last remaining one?</font>

989
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:51,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Her...</font>

990
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,100
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving her alone.</font>

991
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:19,929
<font color=#FFFF00>(Woman of Dignity)</font>

992
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:21,265
<font color=#FFFF00>I want a divorce.</font>

993
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:23,796
<font color=#FFFF00>My wife is suing me for divorce.</font>

994
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:25,194
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks for your help.</font>

995
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,156
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, of course.</font>

996
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:26,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do my very best.</font>

997
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:29,054
<font color=#FFFF00>This is how it all ends!</font>

998
01:00:30,742 --> 01:00:34,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Continue to report to me everything
Mr. Ahn does.</font>

999
01:00:34,156 --> 01:00:35,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Ma'am.</font>

1000
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:38,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it, what are you doing?
We've never met before.</font>

1001
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:39,765
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you...</font>

1002
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,343
<font color=#FFFF00>Do everything I tell you to do?</font>

1003
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:43,804
<font color=#FFFF00>The house you're living in...
It's mine.</font>

1004
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,351
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji-hoo and I need to live there,
get out of this place at once!</font>

1005
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:47,796
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's have it under my name.</font>

1006
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:51,437
<font color=#FFFF00>So your wife won't be able to move here!</font>

1007
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't retreat.</font>

1008
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:54,851
<font color=#FFFF00>We're on the edge of a cliff here.</font>

1009
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:58,148
<font color=#FFFF00>At least... Kill her before you leave.</font>

1010
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:01,510
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a completely ridiculous title.</font>

1011
01:01:01,664 --> 01:01:02,812
<font color=#FFFF00>Jae-gu! Don't do it!</font>

1012
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,656
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm gonna kill her today and go to jail.</font>

1013
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:08,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Kill me!</font>

1014
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:11,491
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you scared that I might do something?</font>

1015
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:18,242
<font color=#FFFF00>I gotta finish it off.</font>

1016
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:19,875
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all.</font>
