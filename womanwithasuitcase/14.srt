2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,350
<font color="yellow">Jo Ye Ryeong and Yoo Tae Oh had a secret affair, right?</font>

3
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,390
<font color="yellow">And the victim Min Na recorded that.</font>

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. Things got out of hand trying to retrieve that video clip.</font>

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,250
<font color="yellow">Bonjour!</font>

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,820
<font color="yellow">Wow, what's this? It's such an interesting combination.</font>

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,870
<font color="yellow">Hey, Yoo Tae Oh, you shouldn't be like that as a man. Huh?</font>

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,220
<font color="yellow">You're going to get it from me.</font>

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,830
<font color="yellow">Cha Geum Joo, leave that here and go home safely.</font>

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,310
<font color="yellow">Having someone order me around, I don't like that particularly.</font>

12
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,900
<font color="yellow">Cha Geum Joo...</font>

13
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,660
<font color="yellow">While I was following you around,</font>

14
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,090
<font color="yellow">I started liking you.</font>

15
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,860
<font color="yellow">Ah, well... I'm talking as in liking you as a person.</font>

16
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,270
<font color="yellow">Then, get lost quietly.</font>

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,870
<font color="yellow">Right now, I'm holding onto an important voice recording and need to go to the prosecutor's office.</font>

18
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:43,260
<font color="yellow">- Hey, look. You—<br>- What are you so curious about?</font>

19
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,960
<font color="yellow">I'm a janitor.</font>

20
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,280
<font color="yellow">Cha Geum Joo, stop right there.</font>

21
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,890
<font color="yellow">If you don't bring that to me, you'll surely die.</font>

22
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,970
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and shoot me.</font>

23
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,150
<font color="yellow">This is my life to me.</font>

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,530
<font color="yellow">Oh, no. I don't have much patience.</font>

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,000
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,710
<font color="yellow">What's that sound?</font>

27
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,700
<font color="yellow">Perhaps... Lawyer Cha?</font>

28
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,440
<font color="yellow">Aish, really.</font>

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,400
<font color="yellow">- It sounded like a gun shot just now.<br>- We heard it too.</font>

30
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,410
<font color="yellow">Liking someone is liking, but you need to listen.</font>

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,980
<font color="yellow">I'll go alone through the side road. Go and find Attorney Cha.</font>

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,980
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Cha!</font>

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,990
<font color="yellow">We need to quickly call 119.</font>

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360

52
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,040
<font color="yellow">While Busan police were investigating drug dealers,</font>

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,130
<font color="yellow">they arrested someone who said he was the culprit behind the homeless girl incident,</font>

<font color="yellow">Ah, that?</font>

56
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,860
<font color="yellow">I was curious why it had to wrap up that way.</font>

57

<font color="yellow">That's</font>

58

<font color="yellow">a complicated question.</font>

59
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,830

60
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,400
<font color="yellow">Geum Joo, thank you.</font>

90
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,510

108
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,460

109
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,740
<font color="yellow">Because you didn't come to the office for a few days, I thought you quit.</font>

110
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,030
<font color="yellow">What do you mean 'quit?' Didn't I tell you I'm like a cicada? A cicada! Like a cicada, I stick right on you!</font>

<font color="yellow">We argued over submitting an appeal.</font>

112
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:04,030

113

<font color="yellow">But why haven't you come to the office?</font>

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,310

115
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,420
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you everything, but first, you need to be secure.</font>

116
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,140
<font color="yellow">Well, because you're reflecting now,</font>

122
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,030
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Seoul National Hospital.</font>

125
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,870
<font color="yellow">I was contacted by Yoo Tae Oh.</font>

126
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,040
<font color="yellow">Then Jo Ye Ryeong tried to stop her scandal from leaking out, so she had someone</font>

127
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,330
<font color="yellow">attack Min Na. Is that what he confessed?</font>

128
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,640
<font color="yellow">Yes. I even recorded everything.</font>

129
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,350
<font color="yellow">But then that man appeared.</font>

130
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,930
<font color="yellow">"That man?" You're talking about the Fixer, right?</font>

131
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

132
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,580
<font color="yellow">Then you told Prosecutor Choi all this, too?</font>

133
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,880
<font color="yellow">No. Prosecutor Choi is Ohsung's snitch anyhow.</font>

134
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,150
<font color="yellow">What are you going to now? He's going to be on the move, looking for Yoo Tae Oh.</font>

135
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,830
<font color="yellow">I need to do an interview.</font>

136
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,010
<font color="yellow">She seems fine.</font>

137
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,690

140
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,740

141
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,950
<font color="yellow">Did you perhaps escape?</font>

142
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,050
<font color="yellow">There's also something I'm good at.</font>

143
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,670
<font color="yellow">I cosplayed as a patient.</font>

144
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,070

145
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,720

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,830
<font color="yellow">Geez, I came out because you got shot, but you're scolding me.</font>

148
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,590
<font color="yellow">Is your body okay?</font>

149
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,990
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

150
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,690
<font color="yellow">Attorney, Cha, this just a warning.</font>

151
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,890
<font color="yellow">Next time, it might not end with a cast.</font>

152
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,820
<font color="yellow">Even so, I can't get squashed away now.</font>

153
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,980
<font color="yellow">You won't change your direction, huh?</font>

154
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,290
<font color="yellow">Then, you two should talk to me over there.</font>

155
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,450
<font color="yellow">There's something I want to ask you about how this happened to you.</font>

156
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,960
<font color="yellow">Alright? Follow me.</font>

157
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:16,580
<font color="yellow">Client, please continue to cosplay a chairman and get enough rest.</font>

158

<font color="yellow">- Where are you going? <br> - Reporters are waiting for me.</font>

159

<font color="yellow">Reporters?</font>

160
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,270
<font color="yellow">You must be thinking of doing an interview with the reporters.</font>

161
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,710
<font color="yellow">You know I'm an expert in that arena.</font>

162
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,200
<font color="yellow">But why are you all covered up? You shouldn't be.</font>

163
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,720
<font color="yellow">Grab it.</font>

164
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,870
<font color="yellow">The point of holding an interview is to make an impact.</font>

165
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,760
<font color="yellow">You have to emphasize that you even got shot.</font>

166
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,670
<font color="yellow">But it's cold—</font>

167
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,370
<font color="yellow">Man, this is much better than covering her.</font>

168
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,350
<font color="yellow">I'll listen to the expert this time.</font>

169
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,970

183

<font color="yellow">This is not a courtroom.</font>

184
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,450
<font color="yellow">I'll reveal everything in the courtroom.</font>

185
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,010
<font color="yellow">Courtroom? What type of courtroom are you referring to?</font>

186

<font color="yellow"><i> - At that appeal...</i></font>

190
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,270
<font color="yellow">How much did Yoo Tae Oh confess?</font>

191
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,120
<font color="yellow">He said that Jo Ye Ryeong was behind the homeless girl, Min Na's incident.</font>

192
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,180
<font color="yellow">But the Fixer showed up all of a sudden and took her cell phone that had the recording on it.</font>

193

<font color="yellow">- How about Yoo Tae Oh?<br> - She didn't tell me anything about him.</font>

194

206
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,310

207

213
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,830

214
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,520
<font color="yellow">But did CEO Lee Dong Soo overextend himself taking care of Yoo Tae Oh and all?</font>

215
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,160
<font color="yellow">Yoo Tae Oh met Cha Geum Joo</font>

216
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,010

218
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,770

226
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,800
<font color="yellow">Since it's come to this, I'm going to have to turn the table.</font>

227

228
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,520
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we escape that before then?</font>

229
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,530
<font color="yellow">Park Hye Joo, I'm a professional.</font>

230
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,220
<font color="yellow">A professional is someone who takes care of business as much as he's been paid and leaves. I'm the Fixer, a janitor.</font>

231
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,700
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me, but look for a way for you to escape.</font>

232
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sure money wasn't the driving force behind your involvement in this.</font>

<font color="yellow">Should I go on?</font>

242
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,080

253

254
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,620

<font color="yellow">It's not a case involving city and state. The court won't accept the retrial that easily.</font>

291
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,240
<font color="yellow">But that was the case I stopped investigating while I was head prosecutor in Busan.</font>

292
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,870
<font color="yellow">I can't even sleep these days.</font>

293
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,960
<font color="yellow">What happened to the guy who confessed to be the real culprit to the homeless girl incident?</font>

294
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,320
<font color="yellow">There is this drug dealer named Lee Byun Dae.</font>

295
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,610
<font color="yellow"><i> 010-7552-2679 </i></font>

296
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,970
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello?</font>

297
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,900
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Oh has arrived in Busan.</font>

298
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,840
<font color="yellow">In Busan?</font>

299
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,050
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand. I'm right on my way.</font>

300
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,290
<font color="yellow">You look so much older than your age.</font>

301
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,520
<font color="yellow">You have the money? Show me it again.</font>

302
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,970
<font color="yellow">I don't... have it right now. I'll send it to you right away.</font>

303
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,660
<font color="yellow">Pay first and get the goods after. Pay up first.</font>

304
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,550
<font color="yellow">Really. I said I'll send it to you right away.</font>

305
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,850
<font color="yellow">You think I've never fell for this before?</font>

306
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,180
<font color="yellow">Hey. You know Lee Byun Dae, right?</font>

307
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,830
<font color="yellow">What about Byun Dae?</font>

308
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,200
<font color="yellow">If you find him, I will give you this for free.</font>

309
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,610
<font color="yellow">How does that sound?</font>

310
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,680
<font color="yellow">Byun Dae!</font>

311
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,820
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

312
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,110
<font color="yellow">You here? You came here rather fast.</font>

313
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,160
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

314
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,170
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey!</font>

315
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,250
<font color="yellow">- What, what? <br> - Here...</font>

316
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,530
<font color="yellow">- Thank you! <br> - Bye!</font>

317
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,200
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

318
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,670
<font color="yellow">Get him!</font>

319
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,200
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

320
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
<font color="yellow">No, go ahead!</font>

321
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,580
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

322
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,930
<font color="yellow">It's fake!!</font>

323
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,490
<font color="yellow">It's a dead end. Hey, hey, that's dangerous.</font>

324
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,500
<font color="yellow">Don't come near, you stupid cop!</font>

325
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,180
<font color="yellow">Put that down. I'm not a cop. I'm a lawyer. Min Na's lawyer.</font>

326
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,950
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? She died a long time ago.</font>

327
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,610
<font color="yellow">You confessed you were the culprit, but the Prosecutors Office let you go, huh?</font>

328
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,320
<font color="yellow">Byun Dae. Min Ah misses you.</font>

329
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,450
<font color="yellow">Crazy bastard, why do you keep talking about Min Na?</font>

330
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,230
<font color="yellow">Because Min Ah is alive.</font>

331
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,970
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about her.</font>

332
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,060
<font color="yellow">I told you don't talk about her!</font>

333
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,790
<font color="yellow">Relax. Byung Dae, relax.</font>

334
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,370
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

335
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,410
<font color="yellow">Hi, Min Ah.</font>

336
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Lawyer Mister. Is there something going on?</font>

337
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,300
<font color="yellow">I have someone I want to show you.</font>

338
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,720
<font color="yellow"><i>- Yes? Who is it?</i><br>- Just a minute.</font>

339
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,670
<font color="yellow">You were alive. You were alive...</font>

340
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,800
<font color="yellow">Even that punk Byun Dae was so happy that you were alive.</font>

341
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,960
<font color="yellow">Tell him I'm so happy that he told the truth. Be sure to. You have to!</font>

342
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

343
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,950
<font color="yellow">I think it's really strange.</font>

344
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:17,460
<font color="yellow">I put my life on the line to catch the murderer. Yet the true perpetrator tells me that he feels so much better.</font>

345
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,960
<font color="yellow">And the victim is even being forgiving.</font>

346
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,940
<font color="yellow">Attorney, the ones who don't like to retry are not the true perpetrator or the victim.</font>

347
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,980
<font color="yellow">It's so ironic that it's the people who don't want to accept their wrongdoings.</font>

348
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,330
<font color="yellow">Accepting that you're wrong is much harder than you think.</font>

349
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:44,020
<font color="yellow">I really felt it this time. Judges and prosecutors make things such as mistakes too.</font>

350
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,720
<font color="yellow">So, there has to be a system that can prove them wrong.</font>

351
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,930
<font color="yellow">But I don't think that would be easy.</font>

352
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:58,820
<font color="yellow">People who believe that they're smart would have a hard time accepting that.</font>

353
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,610
<font color="yellow">This woman has changed many people's lives.</font>

354
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,710
<font color="yellow">It's not right only trying to protect your own career.</font>

355
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,460
<font color="yellow">What will you do about Gyeong Hwan?</font>

356
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,170
<font color="yellow">That is the hardest thing for me.</font>

357
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:21,070
<font color="yellow">The fact that Gyeong Hwan who was falsely accused can't seem to make up his mind.</font>

358
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,930
<font color="yellow">Gyeong Hwan, what did you want to be when you grew up?</font>

359
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,240
<font color="yellow">A baseball player. Just like Lee Dae Oh.</font>

360
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,250
<font color="yellow">But... my dream changed when I was 8 years old.</font>

361
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,540
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

362
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,620
<font color="yellow">To be a pharmacist.</font>

363
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,370
<font color="yellow">When I was 8 years old, my mother sent me to buy medicine.</font>

364
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:19,360
<font color="yellow">I picked up the medicine with a prescription and gave it to mom.</font>

365
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,820
<font color="yellow">That night... my mother died.</font>

366
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,950
<font color="yellow">In my arms...</font>

367
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,150
<font color="yellow">I didn't even what that medicine was going to be used for.</font>

368
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,990
<font color="yellow">And I didn't even know she was trying to kill herself and I bought it for her...</font>

369
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:46,170
<font color="yellow">My dad beat me up all the time for it. So, I left home.</font>

370
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:54,680
<font color="yellow">Only if the pharmacist had said to bring my mom with me...</font>

371
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,300
<font color="yellow">If my mother was just okay...</font>

372
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,680
<font color="yellow">I took one on purpose and each of them...</font>

373
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,910
<font color="yellow">I'm going to eat this.</font>

374
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,600
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm scared.</font>

375
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,320
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you and Min Ah will be put in danger.</font>

376
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,630
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm afraid of...</font>

377
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,810
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

378
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,030
<font color="yellow">So? So that's why you couldn't decide.</font>

379
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,210
<font color="yellow">Don't worry!</font>

380
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,770
<font color="yellow">I have a hidden plan too.</font>

381
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,480
<font color="yellow">You must've thought that I'm such a devoted person to call for this retrial, huh?</font>

382
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,320
<font color="yellow">It's not like that!</font>

383
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,510
<font color="yellow">I'm doing it just because I want to become famous.</font>

384
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,640
<font color="yellow">You want to become famous?</font>

385
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,680
<font color="yellow">That's right! I have my personal greed...</font>

386
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,430
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you don't worry.</font>

387
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,470
<font color="yellow">You and Min Na... If I am to protect my people, I need to become famous.</font>

388
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,430
<font color="yellow">I don't have money and...</font>

389
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:24,080
<font color="yellow">I'm the most dense person in this field.</font>

390
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,020
<font color="yellow">So the only thing I can do is become famous, right?</font>

391
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously...</font>

392
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,200
<font color="yellow">Relax. Everything will be okay.</font>

393
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,800
<font color="yellow">Oppa! You have to be really really well!</font>

394
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,440
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

395
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,820
<font color="yellow">How well will you be?</font>

396
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,880
<font color="yellow"><i> The successful people...</i></font>

397
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,600
<font color="yellow">You have to be very well.</font>

398
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,290
<font color="yellow"><i> How do we win against them? I don't have much power.</i></font>

399
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,800
<font color="yellow"><i>To be honest, I have no confidence.</i></font>

400
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,720
<font color="yellow"><i>At times like these, I have no choice to but to get strong.</i></font>

401
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,180
<font color="yellow"><i> If losers were to unite, you never know. </i></font>

402
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,410
<font color="yellow"><i>It's me. Ham Bok Geo.</i></font>

403
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,990
<font color="yellow">I thought you would be worried.</font>

404
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,770
<font color="yellow">That video is going to be released today.</font>

405
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,080
<font color="yellow"><i> Today, K-fact announced that they have a video clip of missing Hallyu star Yoo Tae Oh and... </i><br><i> K-fact releases a sex video clip between Yoo Tae Oh and daughter-in-law of conglomerate </i></font>

406
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,410
<font color="yellow"><i> and Ohsung Group's second daughter-in-law A</i></font>

407
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:33,130
<font color="yellow"><i> The controversial video clip was filmed in Ohsung vacation home and the person who filmed this is...</i></font>

408
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,710
<font color="yellow"><i> the victim of homeless girl incident, Kim Min Na. </i></font>

409
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,330
<font color="yellow"><i> Whether this case will be retried or now is on everyone's focus. </i></font>

410
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,960
<font color="yellow">What happened there? How did K-fact get a hold of that?</font>

411
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I haven't had it for a few years.</font>

412
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,390
<font color="yellow">There's no way Yoo Tae Oh's agency would've revealed it...</font>

413
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,210
<font color="yellow">Is CEO Lee Dong Soo trying to control Jo Ye Ryeong by releasing this and throwing the first punch?</font>

414
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,600
<font color="yellow">That's weird though.</font>

415
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,170
<font color="yellow">You don't know where Yoo Tae Oh is do you?</font>

416
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,460
<font color="yellow">I'm curious too. Whether he's dead or alive.</font>

417
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,000
<font color="yellow">Ah... starting to get at me more and more.</font>

418
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,510
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry but I can't tell you as of right now.</font>

419
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,790
<font color="yellow">I'll personally contact you at a later time. Okay.</font>

420
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,880
<font color="yellow">I can't give out personal information.</font>

421
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,780
<font color="yellow">Hello, K-fact. Yes, we can't reveal our source.</font>

422
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

423
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,090
<font color="yellow">Let me know who the source is for the video clip.</font>

424
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,300
<font color="yellow">We believe in protecting our source.</font>

425
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,700
<font color="yellow">We can never... never tell you who our source is.</font>

426
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,660
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

427
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,180
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take everything please.</font>

428
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,220
<font color="yellow">I had so much to sort through for trash, but it's nice to have government official to do that for me.</font>

429
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,760
<font color="yellow">What is this... Ah...</font>

430
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,870
<font color="yellow">Are you coming in to work? Are you okay?</font>

431
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,310
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was getting antsy.</font>

432
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,610
<font color="yellow">You plan to wear that at the court?</font>

433
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,310
<font color="yellow">Someone told me this makes an impact.</font>

434
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,160
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Cha. Talk with me for a bit.</font>

435
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,570
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Cha. Let's look at the reality. It won't work this time.</font>

436
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,520
<font color="yellow">Min Na is alive and Gyeong Hwan has done his time.</font>

437
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,990
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Goo.</font>

438
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,860
<font color="yellow">I now think that... this will all be over soon.</font>

439
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,060
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

440
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,380
<font color="yellow">So I thought about it and I realized that if we retrial, I won't make any money.</font>

441
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,860
<font color="yellow">But if I take another case while working on this retrial, I won't be as effective.</font>

442
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,920
<font color="yellow">I'm not confident enough to make you a living.</font>

443
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,080
<font color="yellow">- What? Are you telling me to get out?<br>- Yes.</font>

444
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,820
<font color="yellow">How can you be so disloyal?</font>

445
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,480
<font color="yellow">I looked into it...</font>

446
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,990
<font color="yellow">Harvard Law School?</font>

447
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:20,550
<font color="yellow">I sent them your trial resume and they offered to give you a one year scholarship.</font>

448
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,140
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Cha. You really...</font>

449
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,680
<font color="yellow">I got an interview for next week.</font>

450
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,280
<font color="yellow">So, go ahead and leave.</font>

451
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,290
<font color="yellow">There's no need for you to be so thankful. I mean... Lawyer Goo.</font>

452
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,150
<font color="yellow">You are the best lawyer in all of Korea.</font>

453
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,230
<font color="yellow">But when you come back, you have to come back to Golden Tree.</font>

454
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,620
<font color="yellow">You can't play elsewhere just because you're so successful.</font>

455
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,630
<font color="yellow">Our Cha Geum Joo... let me give you a hug.</font>

456
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,800
<font color="yellow"><i> There's no room. Take the next one. </i></font>

457
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,490
<font color="yellow"><i> I can make room. </i></font>

458
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,830
<font color="yellow"><i> Oh, my... oh, my... oh, my... </i></font>

459
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,120
<font color="yellow">What blew over?</font>

460
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,190
<font color="yellow">It's today's headline on K-fact.</font>

461
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,890
<font color="yellow"><i> [Breaking News] The biggest scandal, Yoo Tae Oh and daughter-in-law of conglomerate, sex video revealed </i></font>

462
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,760
<font color="yellow">- By chance, didn't you release this, CEO? <br> - How could...</font>

463
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,880
<font color="yellow">How could this be in Ham Bok Geo's hands?</font>

464
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,380
<font color="yellow">What's Jo Ye Ryeong doing?</font>

465
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,610
<font color="yellow">She's asking for explanation right away.</font>

466
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,450
<font color="yellow">Do you possibly know who gave them that video?</font>

467
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,550
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. How did that get leaked?</font>

468
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,410
<font color="yellow">For now, we're thinking of denying that you're the woman in the video clip.</font>

469
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,350
<font color="yellow">How about Prosecutors Office?</font>

470
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,000
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to Prosecutor Choi and although there will be an investigation...</font>

471
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,660
<font color="yellow">I've already mentioned that we should drive this as a photo manipulation.</font>

472
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,580
<font color="yellow">But that's not the problem...</font>

473
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,370
<font color="yellow">The thing is who released this video clip?</font>

474
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,930
<font color="yellow">By chance, do you suspect anyone...</font>

475
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,900
<font color="yellow">Why is Representative Lee not coming?</font>

476
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,160
<font color="yellow">Ah... he is coming right now. However...</font>

477
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,520
<font color="yellow">is there a possibility that somebody else who knows Representative Lee Dong Soo could have the video?</font>

478
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know. That would be a bit difficult.</font>

479
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,910
<font color="yellow">He ordered me to sell Ohsung Art Center shares over that.</font>

480
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,690
<font color="yellow">It's just that I heard something strange from Prosecutor Choi.</font>

481
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,910
<font color="yellow">I heard that CEO Lee Dong Soo is working with hedge fund Milliet.</font>

482
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,260
<font color="yellow">The last I heard, it's special investigative team's top secret information.</font>

483
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,550
<font color="yellow">Lee Dong Soo...</font>

484
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,890
<font color="yellow">Then, have a nice chat.</font>

485
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,970
<font color="yellow">I'm extremely sorry about the leaking of video clip.</font>

486
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,630
<font color="yellow">I'm looking into it also, but...</font>

487
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,840
<font color="yellow">What more do you need?</font>

488
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,600
<font color="yellow">What are you referring to?</font>

489
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,640
<font color="yellow">I gave everything to Representative Lee.</font>

490
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,560
<font color="yellow">Did you hold Milliet's hand instead of me?</font>

491
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,810
<font color="yellow">Why don't you tell me? The thing that special investigative team is looking into...</font>

492
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,060
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Goo will be back soon, right?</font>

493
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,220
<font color="yellow">Lawyer. I keep getting greedy.</font>

494
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,220
<font color="yellow">How should I say it? I want to become a skilled lawyer, even if I could do it in one day. That kind of greed.</font>

495
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,580
<font color="yellow">So I want to become a trustworthy and confident partner to you.</font>

496
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,990
<font color="yellow">Did you not know? Even you right now,</font>

497
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,480
<font color="yellow">you are a proud partner.</font>

498
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,000
<font color="yellow">- Really?<br>- Of course!</font>

499
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,790
<font color="yellow">Oh... thank you.</font>

500
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,870
<font color="yellow">But um.. are you going to keep keeping this a secret from me?</font>

501
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,880
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

502
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,040
<font color="yellow">About Yoo Tae Oh's whereabouts.</font>

503
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,850
<font color="yellow">We have to submit our request for the retrial and...</font>

504
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,440
<font color="yellow">I think it's about time that you told me about it.</font>

505
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,870
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I don't really know either.</font>

506
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,510
<font color="yellow">Wait, what? You don't know?</font>

507
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,790
<font color="yellow">When I woke up after getting shot, I was in the hospital.</font>

508
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,920
<font color="yellow">I think it may have been Alan...</font>

509
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,180
<font color="yellow">I think maybe he took Yoo Tae Oh somewhere but</font>

510
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,450
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened.</font>

511
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,990
<font color="yellow">You did an interview though acting as if you knew everything.</font>

512
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,280
<font color="yellow">Well, kind of sort of bluffing?</font>

513
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,490
<font color="yellow">Ah, lie...</font>

514
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,980
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

515
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,510
<font color="yellow">With my hidden cards...</font>

516
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,640
<font color="yellow">I couldn't imagine overcoming this crisis.</font>

517
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,100
<font color="yellow">So, I acted as if I had it all.</font>

518
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,470
<font color="yellow">- Ah... so its so you can get the retrial and find Yoo Tae Oh?<br>- Yep.</font>

519
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,070
<font color="yellow">But... I can't believe it.</font>

520
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,090
<font color="yellow">Why did you bluff with me, too?</font>

521
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,320
<font color="yellow">Because you're so naive.</font>

522
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,300
<font color="yellow">You're the type who wears his feelings on his sleeves.</font>

523
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,380
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd get caught if I told you.</font>

524
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,630
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you don't have a poker face.</font>

525
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,190
<font color="yellow">So how do look to you right now?</font>

526
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,150
<font color="yellow">I made you mad?</font>

527
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,410
<font color="yellow">Wrong. I'm in a good mood.</font>

528
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,740
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

529
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,070
<font color="yellow">Did your workplace give you a lot of severance pay?</font>

530
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,810
<font color="yellow">I think Professional Kang put him away.</font>

531
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,530
<font color="yellow">Put him away?</font>

532
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,530
<font color="yellow">- What?<br>- You know that...</font>

533
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,390
<font color="yellow">Tae Oh?</font>

534
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, the day Paralegal Cha fell is the day he was put away.</font>

535
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,800
<font color="yellow">I looked into it. Since I chased him down, there was no evidence of him on the phone.</font>

536
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,570
<font color="yellow">I don't think he left the vacation home.</font>

537
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,260
<font color="yellow">Then, how about the location where he's been put away?</font>

538
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,230
<font color="yellow">Well, that...</font>

539
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,030
<font color="yellow">Was it you by any chance?</font>

540
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,880
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

541
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,300
<font color="yellow">I suddenly can't get in contact with Pro Kang.</font>

542
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,840
<font color="yellow">Jo Ye Ryeong's video clip has leaked.</font>

543
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,610
<font color="yellow">Someone is totally screwing me over, but...</font>

544
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,970
<font color="yellow">The one I'm suspecting of...</font>

545
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,130
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like it's you?</font>

546
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,870
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I'm playing the snitch?</font>

547
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,070
<font color="yellow">If so, why would I do such a thing?</font>

548
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,640
<font color="yellow">I would've revealed the autopsy results.</font>

549
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,230
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

550
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,940
<font color="yellow">To cut me out completely?</font>

551
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,800
<font color="yellow">Report to Jo Ye Ryeong.</font>

552
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,830
<font color="yellow">You move Ohsung and...</font>

553
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,370
<font color="yellow">The fact that Milliet is controlling you...</font>

554
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,600
<font color="yellow">What happens if Ohsung family finds out about that?</font>

555
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,560
<font color="yellow">Boy, you watched too many videos.</font>

556
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,840
<font color="yellow">What connection is there between me and Milliet?</font>

557
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,330
<font color="yellow"><i> CEO Lee Dong Soo is being controlled by the international hedge fund Milliet.</i></font>

558
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,930
<font color="yellow"><i>Buy stock shares of Ohsung and... </i></font>

559
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,100
<font color="yellow"><i> control Ohsung to his heart content. </i></font>

560
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,810
<font color="yellow">Attorney Park, what are you thinking right now? Perhaps...</font>

561
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,140
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to go back?</font>

562
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,100
<font color="yellow">As if.</font>

563
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,840
<font color="yellow">I've come too far to go back.</font>

564
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,860
<font color="yellow">CEO. Taking me in as a hostage...</font>

565
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,880
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you miscalculated?</font>

566
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,700
<font color="yellow">Chan Geum Joo...</font>

567
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,830
<font color="yellow">She can give up everything for me but...</font>

568
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,540
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

569
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in Cha Geum Joo's life.</font>

570
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,070
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

571
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,970
<font color="yellow">rather than becoming a pathetic hostage...</font>

572
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:00,670
<font color="yellow">Rather, I'd like this seat.</font>

573
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,040
<font color="yellow">Please drink it and let's get going.</font>

574
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,640
<font color="yellow">You have to go to the director's meeting and explain yourself today.</font>

575
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,870
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can go.</font>

576
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,640
<font color="yellow">No, I mean... I can't go.</font>

577
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,330
<font color="yellow">Even so, you have to go out there.</font>

578
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,640
<font color="yellow">I will stop them so don't worry too much.</font>

579
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,700
<font color="yellow">If you get an uneasy question, don't answer it.</font>

580
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,800
<font color="yellow">Just show a puzzled look on your face.</font>

581
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,510
<font color="yellow">You understand?</font>

582
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,110
<font color="yellow">Ohsung's reputation has fallen to the ground!</font>

583
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,010
<font color="yellow">Resign from your director position right away.</font>

584
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,740
<font color="yellow">Or explain yourself about the video clip.</font>

585
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,010
<font color="yellow">Whatever you may have seen...</font>

586
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,340
<font color="yellow">That is not the truth.</font>

587
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,510
<font color="yellow">It was manipulated.</font>

588
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:28,620
<font color="yellow">You call that an explanation?</font>

589
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,360
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to deceive us, too?</font>

590
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,770
<font color="yellow">We'll wrap up here.</font>

591
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,580
<font color="yellow">If you have any objections in the future, please submit it to me in writing.</font>

592
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,610
<font color="yellow">No matter what it is, you can let me know.</font>

593
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,070
<font color="yellow">As for my email address...</font>

594
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,460
<font color="yellow">I'll send it to your secretaries.</font>

595
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

596
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,180
<font color="yellow">Wow... Ms. Golden Tree, you got so famous.</font>

597
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,010
<font color="yellow">It's thanks to you.</font>

598
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,120
<font color="yellow">But don't you think you're requesting visitors too often?</font>

599
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,250
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed.</font>

600
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,300
<font color="yellow">The homeless girl case retrial... is that all you're after?</font>

601
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,740
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let me rot here?</font>

602
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,530
<font color="yellow">You know everything. Why are you acting this way?</font>

603
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,470
<font color="yellow">In order to get you out of there...</font>

604
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,260
<font color="yellow">we have to dig into the homeless girl incident.</font>

605
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,490
<font color="yellow">You saw it at our last trial.</font>

606
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,730
<font color="yellow">Even if I argue the possibility of the third party committing the murder,</font>

607
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,320
<font color="yellow">the judge didn't even budge.</font>

608
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,580
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to retrial?</font>

609
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,240
<font color="yellow">Of course!</font>

610
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,750
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask me this out of the blue?</font>

611
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,330
<font color="yellow">How could someone like you be so rude in front of the judge?</font>

612
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,170
<font color="yellow">I believe in the existence of the law but</font>

613
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,420
<font color="yellow">As for people who practice law...</font>

614
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,710
<font color="yellow">I decided not to believe them too easily.</font>

615
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,910
<font color="yellow">If we end up with a retrial,</font>

616
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,870
<font color="yellow">you'll get to testify as a witness.</font>

617
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:06,780
<font color="yellow">So... you need to prepare yourself.</font>

618
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,810
<font color="yellow">The source of that video clip...</font>

619
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,850
<font color="yellow">Was it Park Hye Joo?</font>

620
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,980
<font color="yellow">I can't reveal my source.</font>

621
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,110
<font color="yellow">Why would Park Hye Joo...</font>

622
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,380
<font color="yellow">Why she gave you that video...</font>

623
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,090
<font color="yellow">Did you think of the motive?</font>

624
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,120
<font color="yellow">I hear that Ohsung Law Firm's Representative...</font>

625
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,640
<font color="yellow">has changed.</font>

626

<font color="yellow">Is this how you repay my generosity?</font>

639
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,070
<font color="yellow">Was that a rope to rescue me?</font>

640

691
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:35,050

692
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,960
<font color="yellow">May I ask you the reason?</font>

693
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,970
<font color="yellow">According to the record, besides Defendant Oh Gyeong Hwan had confessed his crime at the prosecutors' office,</font>

694
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,210
<font color="yellow">he admitted his crime at the court as well.</font>

695
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,890
<font color="yellow">Being taken this into consideration, his sentence was reduced.</font>

696
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:52,970
<font color="yellow">That confession was made under coercive investigation.</font>

697
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,680
<font color="yellow">Please reference evidence #1 I submitted earlier.</font>

698
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,470
<font color="yellow">After Defendant Oh Gyeong Hwan was released from prison, he wrote an apology letter several times and mailed it to the police.</font>

699
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:08,090
<font color="yellow">And even though the victim is alive, the testimony from the person who survived from the brain death.</font>

700
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,950
<font color="yellow">is fully reliable? That's my doubt.</font>

701
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,670

703
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:30,490
<font color="yellow">That's just the defense argument. The incident was already closed by the Prosecutors Office and the police for lack of evidence.</font>

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,400
<font color="yellow">CEO Park, I welcome you to our Grace Group.</font>

728
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,970
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Rather than the madam who doesn't even show her face anywhere...</font>

729
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,660
<font color="yellow">CEO Park would better serve as a vice chairwoman.</font>

730
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,690
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

731
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,780
<font color="yellow">You have a guest.</font>

732
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,620
<font color="yellow">CEO Lee Dong Soo.</font>

733
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,020
<font color="yellow">Did you receive a confirmation for your retrial?</font>

734
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:15,660
<font color="yellow">This was a difficult visit for you. Please tell me what brought you here.</font>

735
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,270
<font color="yellow">I thought Ham Bok Geo would stop it, but he's revealing it unexpectedly.</font>

736
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:27,940
<font color="yellow">I don't like it when someone forces me to do something.</font>

737
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:33,530
<font color="yellow">My circumstance is looking pathetic for me to beat around the bush with you.</font>

738
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:40,240
<font color="yellow">After the retrial, your career and other things... they'll all end.</font>

739
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:47,090
<font color="yellow">Look after your own career.</font>

740
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:52,590
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd have something other to say besides a threat.</font>

741
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:57,280
<font color="yellow">I'm busy because I have to prepare for the retrial.</font>

742
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,670
<font color="yellow">Do you still...</font>

743
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:02,720
<font color="yellow">think of her as your sister?</font>

744
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,770
<font color="yellow">You must still think of Attorney Park as your younger sister, but...</font>

745
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,540
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

746
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,080
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see the CEO. CEO Park Hye Soo.</font>

747
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,220
<font color="yellow">I'll have to inspect you. This is the CEO's order.</font>

748
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,980
<font color="yellow">My body is covered with metals. It would be difficult.</font>

749
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,580
<font color="yellow">I'm the Golden Tree.</font>

750
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,340
<font color="yellow"><i> Prosecutor Choi </i></font>

751

<font color="yellow">Ah, seriously...<br><i> Prosecutor Choi </i></font>

752
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,980
<font color="yellow"><i> CEO Park Hye Joo </i></font>

753
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:14,160
<font color="yellow">I got out of a meeting since I heard you were coming.</font>

754
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,720
<font color="yellow">Where's Yoo Tae Oh?</font>

755
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,520
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask me that? I think I cooperated with you as much as I can.</font>

756
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,900
<font color="yellow">Now, you're asking me to find out where Yoo Tae Oh's body is now?</font>

757
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,840
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

758
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,890
<font color="yellow">His body?</font>

759
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:41,470
<font color="yellow">You already knew that Yoo Tae Oh was dead from the time you came to visit me, right?</font>

760
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:45,200
<font color="yellow">- What makes you think that? <br>- Earlier...</font>

761
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,220
<font color="yellow">I asked you where Yoo Tae Oh was. Not if he was dead.</font>

762
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,050
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo... no...</font>

763
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,740
<font color="yellow">Attorney Park Hye Joo...</font>

764
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,420
<font color="yellow">You already knew Yoo Tae Oh was dead and used me.</font>

765
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,160
<font color="yellow">To get rid of CEO Lee Dong Soo.</font>

766
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,120
<font color="yellow">Then, let me ask you again.</font>

767
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,760
<font color="yellow">Where is Yoo Tae Oh?</font>

768
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,360
<font color="yellow">Paralegal Cha, please!</font>

769
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,840
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time you behave like an attorney?</font>

770
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,700
<font color="yellow">- Like an attorney?<br> - There are attorneys everywhere you turn.</font>

771

772
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:33,910
<font color="yellow">Ah, your press conference was very honest. Sounds like you passed the bar with a difference of one point.</font>

773
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:39,730
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now? You don't have the brain to survive Seochodong now.</font>

774
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:47,290
<font color="yellow">Don't be delusional. You were cool when you used to be a paralegal.</font>

<font color="yellow">The retrial has been decided.</font>

778
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,770
<font color="yellow">Retrial?</font>

779
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:11,200
<font color="yellow">Fine, work hard on your retrial. But would it change anything?</font>

780
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,400
<font color="yellow">There's a limit to what you can do.</font>

781
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,820
<font color="yellow">Of course, it would be like that by myself. Since I don't have the brain to survive that...</font>
