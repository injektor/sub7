64
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:43,506
<font color="yellow">Well... it's because I'm wondering what you'll do. Like if you suddenly cooperate with Cha Geum Joo.</font>

<font color="yellow">So, now... in a way, you were selling sex.</font>

294
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:32,506
<font color="yellow">Objection. She was a minor and had left home at the time...</font>

295
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:35,006
<font color="yellow">She was invited without knowing what she was going to do.</font>

296
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,856
<font color="yellow">Defense, it's true that she sold sex regardless.</font>

297
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,586
<font color="yellow">Are you going to deny that?</font>

298
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,346
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

299
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:48,146
<font color="yellow">Witness, you can go back to your seat.</font>

300
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:51,856
<font color="yellow">I call Lee Byung Dae to the stand next.</font>

301
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:56,096
<font color="yellow">For your information, Lee Byung Dae has confessed that he's the real culprit to the crime.</font>

302
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,926
<font color="yellow"><i> He's the culprit! Why didn't they catch him? </i></font>

303
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:02,256
<font color="yellow"><i> He's the one! He's the real one! </i></font>

304
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,626
<font color="yellow"><i> He's the one! Why don't they put him away? </i></font>

305
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:10,276
<font color="yellow">Witness, at the time, you came to Seoul from Busan.</font>

306
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:14,286
<font color="yellow">- Were you temporarily living in a homeless shelter near Suwon train station? <br> - Yes.</font>

307
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,756
<font color="yellow">The day of the incident, you were hired by someone...</font>

308
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:20,686
<font color="yellow">and then you kidnapped Min Na. That's what you confessed here.</font>

309
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:22,076
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

310
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,626
<font color="yellow">Yes. I did that.</font>

311
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,146
<font color="yellow"><i> Someone told me to. </i></font>

312
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,446
<font color="yellow"><i> He gave me 7 million won and... </i></font>

313
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,886
<font color="yellow"><i> told me to bring him Min Na's cell phone.</i></font>

314
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:40,656
<font color="yellow"><i> Hey, give me your cell phone. </i></font>

315
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:43,026
<font color="yellow"><i> I didn't bring my cell phone with me tonight. </i></font>

316
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:44,506
<font color="yellow"><i> Are you kidding me? </i></font>

317
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,126
<font color="yellow"><i> I thought she was lying. </i></font>

318
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,416
<font color="yellow"><i> And I heard people coming. </i></font>

319
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,426
<font color="yellow"><i> So, I dragged her to Ohjang Park. </i></font>

320
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:01,186
<font color="yellow"><i> I really... I really left it behind.</i></font>

321
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:04,806
<font color="yellow"><i> You want to die? Hurry up and give it to me. </i></font>

322
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:09,166
<font color="yellow"><i> I'll give you money. Have all this. </i></font>

323
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,376
<font color="yellow"><i> Time is running out. He's waiting for me. </i></font>

324
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:15,266
<font color="yellow"><i> Hurry up and give it! </i></font>

325
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:19,716
<font color="yellow"><i> Hey, is your cell phone more important than your life right now? </i></font>

326
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:24,986
<font color="yellow"><i> Hey, hey! </i></font>

327
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:36,096
<font color="yellow"><i> So, I thought she was dead. I was scared and ran away. </i></font>

328
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:41,496
<font color="yellow">I... I did it...</font>

329
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:51,826
<font color="yellow">What did you do with the knife you used at the crime scene?</font>

330
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:54,786
<font color="yellow">I hid it under my bed mattress...</font>

331
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:58,236
<font color="yellow">The Busanjin Police took it.</font>

332
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:03,386
<font color="yellow">Did you confess as the culprit behind the homeless girl incident?</font>

333
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:06,326
<font color="yellow">- Yes. <br> - But how did you get released?</font>

334
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:10,816
<font color="yellow">By chance, did you change your testimony during the prosecution interrogation?</font>

335
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:20,136
<font color="yellow">No. The fact that I was at the crime scene...</font>

336
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:24,046
<font color="yellow">and I explained how I stabbed Min Na in detail...</font>

337
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:29,746
<font color="yellow">They said the case is closed all of a sudden and let me go.</font>

338
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:40,916
<font color="yellow">I thought Min Na was really dead...</font>

339
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,656
<font color="yellow">I was so tormented.</font>

340
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:49,096
<font color="yellow">But... I'm so glad she's alive.</font>

341
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:52,156
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

342
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:56,646
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

343
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:12,086
<font color="yellow">Witness. You're saying you were hired.</font>

344
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:16,826
<font color="yellow">Where did you spend the money you got paid for doing that?</font>

345
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,286
<font color="yellow">Living expenses...</font>

346
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,646
<font color="yellow">and bought drugs...</font>

347
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:25,996
<font color="yellow">You bought drugs?</font>

348
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:33,476
<font color="yellow">You were arrested a few times for possession of drugs, right?</font>

349
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,826
<font color="yellow">Twice...</font>

350
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:38,406
<font color="yellow">The prosecution is doubting someone who received money from a stranger...</font>

351
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:42,966
<font color="yellow">and got an innocent girl unconscious. This drug addict's testimony...</font>

352
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:46,226
<font color="yellow">I'm questioning whether there's any truth to his testimony.</font>

353
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:50,486
<font color="yellow">And... I'm wondering if someone...</font>

354
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,286
<font color="yellow">hired him this time as well...</font>

355
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:59,786
<font color="yellow">Please hear this witness' testimony with some reasonable doubt.</font>

356
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,256
<font color="yellow">Geez, that prosecutor...</font>

357
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:04,896
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

358
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,836
<font color="yellow">I'll interrogate witness Jo Ye Ryeong.</font>

359
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:13,436
<font color="yellow">I'll permit that.</font>

360
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:24,516
<font color="yellow">Do you know Yoo Tae Oh personally?</font>

361
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:27,276
<font color="yellow">No, I don't know him very well.</font>

362
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:32,856
<font color="yellow">Since he's a model for Ohsung Fashion, I've bumped into him a few times at season fashion shows.</font>

363
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:54,296
<font color="yellow">If that's the case, what is this video clip about?</font>

364
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:02,186
<font color="yellow">It must be someone else or a superimposed image.</font>

365
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,466
<font color="yellow">This is not a superimposed image.</font>

366
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:10,356
<font color="yellow"><i> Professional Opinion </i></font>

367
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:21,936
<font color="yellow">As if this has your fingerprints...</font>

368
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:24,056
<font color="yellow">it's a testimony given by a professional.</font>

369
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:26,736
<font color="yellow">How would you explain this?</font>

370
00:28:26,736 --> 00:28:32,126
<font color="yellow">As you know, there are conflicting issues outsiders can't understand within my family.</font>

371
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:37,316
<font color="yellow">I've had to butt heads with the family members for a long time over Ohsung Art Center director position.</font>

372
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,396
<font color="yellow">I believe that video clip is a trap.</font>

373
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:47,436
<font color="yellow">Then, are you saying that woman could be a body double?</font>

374
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:51,516
<font color="yellow">Look, Cha Geum Joo! You were my lawyer before? How could you do this?</font>

375
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:55,656
<font color="yellow">You ordered your secretary to retrieve that video clip...</font>

376
00:28:55,656 --> 00:29:00,716
<font color="yellow">and your secretary bribed witness Lee Byung Dae. Isn't that right?</font>

377
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,926
<font color="yellow">I will deny further interrogation.</font>

378
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:16,036
<font color="yellow">May I ask witness Lee Byung Dae one more thing?</font>

379
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,736
<font color="yellow">I will permit it.</font>

380
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:22,156
<font color="yellow">Witness, among these people...</font>

381

00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,526

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:01,756
<font color="yellow">The person Lee Byung Dae picked out is...</font>

388
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:18,246
<font color="yellow">Will you continue to insist on superimposing the image or a body double?</font>

00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,396
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

390
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:29,896
<font color="yellow">I'll interrogate Park Hye Joo who was defendant Oh Gyeong Hwan's lawyer at the time.</font>

395
00:30:56,916 --> 00:31:01,186

396
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,516
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

401
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,976
<font color="yellow">I will not testify regarding that.</font>

402

<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

412
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:03,756

413
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,686
<font color="yellow">Is it Jo Ye Ryeong?</font>

414
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:07,806

415
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:16,066
<font color="yellow">There's no way I'd know that. But shouldn't you reveal your source for that video clip first?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

430
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,306
<font color="yellow">Is that because of your guilty conscience?</font>

431
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:48,346

<font color="yellow">I really didn't do it...</font>

433
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:55,166
<font color="yellow">But if I didn't write a letter of reflection, it felt like the police would come looking for me.</font>

434
00:33:55,166 --> 00:34:00,126
<font color="yellow">A scary ahjussi tried to kill me...</font>

435

<font color="yellow">Prosecutor, you're making fun of such a defendant right now.</font>

439
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,056
<font color="yellow">Apologize.</font>

440
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,866
<font color="yellow">Apologize?</font>

441
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:25,586
<font color="yellow">Attorney Ma, he's cold...</font>

442
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:36,296
<font color="yellow">Defendant, you said you were under a coercive interrogation.</font>

443
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:41,306
<font color="yellow">By chance, did the prosecutor beat you?</font>

444
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:44,596
<font color="yellow">That's not it, but...</font>

445
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,646
<font color="yellow"><i> I didn't do it. </i></font>

446
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:52,176
<font color="yellow"><i> It's... it's not me... </i></font>

447
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,896
<font color="yellow"><i> Hey... </i></font>

448
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,486
<font color="yellow"><i> If you keep insisting like that, you'll be in big trouble. </i></font>

449
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:04,316
<font color="yellow"><i> You have to confess if you want to go home. </i></font>

450
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:17,086
<font color="yellow"><i> Gyeong Hwan, you did wrong impulsively. </i></font>

451
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:22,166
<font color="yellow"><i> So, help me make a determination.</i></font>

452
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,696
<font color="yellow"><i> Whether you're supposed to be punished... </i></font>

453
00:35:25,736 --> 00:35:29,706
<font color="yellow"><i> or someone I need to teach and lead... </i></font>

454
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:32,696
<font color="yellow"><i> I should know that. </i></font>

455
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:41,196
<font color="yellow"><i> Gyeong Hwan, where's the first place you took Min Na to? </i></font>

456
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:47,366
<font color="yellow"><i> Train station, right? </i></font>

457
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:49,946
<font color="yellow"><i> It was the train station, right? </i></font>

458
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:59,756
<font color="yellow"><i> For your information, Min Na was found in front of the painted rock near the garden. </i></font>

459
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:01,726
<font color="yellow"><i> Where was it? </i></font>

460
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,156
<font color="yellow"><i> Point it out to me. </i></font>

461
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:15,056
<font color="yellow"><i> He-Here... </i></font>

462
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:35,236
<font color="yellow">Even in Yakchon intersection case, Nara supermarket case...</font>

463
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,676
<font color="yellow">We've seen this from time to time...</font>

464
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:42,966
<font color="yellow">As if to catch a rabbit, the prosecution corners the weak.</font>

465
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,066
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

466
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:52,156
<font color="yellow">I call Jeong Ahn Soo who was the prosecutor at the time to the stand.</font>

467
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:59,706
<font color="yellow">Do you acknowledge your coercive interrogation?</font>

468
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:01,006
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

469
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:07,666
<font color="yellow">While you were the prosecutor in Busan, the true culprit showed up. Why did you stop the investigation?</font>

470
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:11,166
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

471
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:15,806
<font color="yellow">Because your subordinates were digging into the case you closed</font>

472
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:18,626
<font color="yellow">you ordered them to release the true culprit, right?<br><i> A crazy guy saying he killed the homeless girl. Stop the investigation. We already have confession from Oh Gyeong Hwan. We can't start all over. It's a headache. We have other cases. </i></font>

473

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

475
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:30,636
<font color="yellow">What is that angry look in your eyes?</font>

476
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:38,516
<font color="yellow">Don't you think we should straighten this case even now?</font>

477
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:44,086
<font color="yellow">The truth of the case is known by those kids and God knows it, too.</font>

478
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:46,686
<font color="yellow"><i> - God? <br> - What the heck is he saying?</i></font>

479
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,216
<font color="yellow">God?</font>

480
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:58,956
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

481
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:02,866
<font color="yellow">How did this happen to that guy...</font>

482
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,756
<font color="yellow">He's totally hopeless.</font>

483
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:08,776
<font color="yellow">Prosecution, are you going to cross examine?</font>

484
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:13,456
<font color="yellow">No, we won't.</font>

485
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,896
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's game over?</font>

486
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:19,326
<font color="yellow">Geez, if that moron didn't say that crazy nonsense, I was going to let it go and just write up something.</font>

487
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:23,886
<font color="yellow">I call K-fact's CEO Ham Gok Beo to the witness stand.</font>

488
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:32,976
<font color="yellow">You've been following the homeless girl case as the CEO of K-fact, right?</font>

489
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,216
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

490
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:41,166
<font color="yellow">I started doing that because I met a paralegal who is extremely nosy.</font>

491
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:46,936
<font color="yellow">I'll watch it.</font>

492
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:50,916
<font color="yellow">Why are you so attached to this case?</font>

493
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:57,446
<font color="yellow">A mysterious username known as Tommy Kim was geographically someone who lived in the Ohsung vacation home.</font>

494
00:38:57,446 --> 00:39:02,136
<font color="yellow">It seemed like it was relevant to the Food Talk.</font>

495
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:05,926
<font color="yellow">Objection. His testimony has nothing to do with this case.</font>

496
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:10,176
<font color="yellow">Witness, you're serving time for murdering Seo Ji Ah, right?</font>

497
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:13,696
<font color="yellow">- As you can see. <br> - Did you kill Seo Ji Ah?</font>

498
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:20,766
<font color="yellow">- Yes.<br>- What is he saying?</font>

499
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:32,216
<font color="yellow">You're admitting the fact that you killed Seo Ji Ah?</font>

500
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:34,376
<font color="yellow">I admit it.</font>

501
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:41,896
<font color="yellow">In the end... it was all my fault.</font>

502
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:51,026
<font color="yellow">During the sex hostess case, I was the prosecutor on the case. I couldn't hold back my temper and quit.</font>

503
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:57,166
<font color="yellow">For my own freedom, I lived as the paparazzi media CEO and lived a compromising life.</font>

504
00:39:57,166 --> 00:40:01,966
<font color="yellow">During all that, a woman got tangled up in this case...</font>

505
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:05,576
<font color="yellow">but I had to sit back and watch that woman go to jail.</font>

506
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:10,626
<font color="yellow">Having to just watch those kids being ridiculed in this courtroom...</font>

507
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:14,976
<font color="yellow">All these things are my crimes.</font>

508
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:18,926
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm guilty.</font>

509
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:21,296
<font color="yellow"><i> He's the man! </i></font>

510
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:26,236
<font color="yellow"><i> He's the man! A real man!</i></font>

511
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:30,906
<font color="yellow">I'll take it as guilty symbolically.</font>

512
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:33,176
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

513
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:44,196
<font color="yellow">Witness, why didn't you expose the truth behind the homeless girl case even though you knew?</font>

514
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:46,826
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a crucial evidence.</font>

515
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:51,926
<font color="yellow">You kept silent because you lacked a crucial evidence.</font>

516
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:56,776
<font color="yellow">Do you know the common denominator between a prosecutor and paparazzi media?</font>

517
00:40:57,636 --> 00:41:03,546
<font color="yellow">There are many cases that you keep quiet about even though you know the truth.</font>

518
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:13,336
<font color="yellow">Prosecution, wrap it up if you don't have anymore questions.</font>

519
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:17,016
<font color="yellow">I call Lee Dong Soo to the witness stand.</font>

520
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:33,596
<font color="yellow">The defense argues that the victim was called to your vacation home.</font>

521
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:35,416
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

522
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,526
<font color="yellow">I've heard some things people talk about Food Talk also.</font>

523
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:40,276
<font color="yellow">Like gossip.</font>

524
00:41:40,276 --> 00:41:44,336
<font color="yellow">There are people who are jealous over people who got together over drinks.</font>

525
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:48,196
<font color="yellow">Because it denied people who are troublemakers in our society.</font>

526
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:52,086
<font color="yellow">For your information, Ham Bok Geo is also a member of our Food Talk.</font>

527
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,986
<font color="yellow">If you need it, I'll submit a photograph.</font>

528
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:59,466
<font color="yellow">- Ham Bok Geo, too? <br> - No, he's not.</font>

529
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,876
<font color="yellow">Ham Bok Geo is also a member?</font>

530
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,936
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

531
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:11,306
<font color="yellow">Do you know deceased Seo Ji Ah whom the defendant insists that she took her to the vacation home?</font>

532
00:42:11,306 --> 00:42:13,226
<font color="yellow">I don't know her.</font>

533
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:19,896
<font color="yellow">Some say Yoo Tae Oh disappeared at your vacation home. What do you think about that?</font>

534
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:24,156
<font color="yellow">I'll answer that if Yoo Tae Oh's whereabouts or body is found out.</font>

535
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:29,056
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can say at this point.</font>

536
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,076
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

537
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:37,076
<font color="yellow">Defense, will you cross-examine?</font>

538
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:39,026
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

539
00:42:54,406 --> 00:43:00,826
<font color="yellow">Looking over your trial experience... it was quite brilliant.</font>

540

542
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:17,026
<font color="yellow">Witness, you as a regular man...</font>

543
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:21,106
<font color="yellow">you have an ability to be a great legal representative.</font>

544
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:25,386
<font color="yellow">Thank you, but what are you trying to say...</font>

545
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:30,066
<font color="yellow">Counselor, hurry up and make your connection to this case.</font>

548
00:43:37,506 --> 00:43:38,486
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

549
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:39,996

550
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:44,836

00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:14,066

<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

562
00:44:47,406 --> 00:44:50,346

570
00:45:34,476 --> 00:45:38,596
<font color="yellow">I do acknowledge that there was somewhat of a coercive interrogation.</font>

571

<font color="yellow">However, this case and the teenage sex hostess case are different cases.</font>

581
00:46:58,156 --> 00:47:03,506
<font color="yellow">The truth can never be locked away.</font>

582
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:10,366
<font color="yellow">Please console these kids' wounds by giving him a not guilty verdict.</font>

583
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:21,836
<font color="yellow">Do we have to give a not guilty verdict? Then we're admitting the court's mistake.</font>

584
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:24,696
<font color="yellow">Earlier didn't Attorney Cha Geum Joo hint at</font>

585
00:47:24,696 --> 00:47:28,936
<font color="yellow">leaving the Food Talk alone if we give a not guilty verdict?</font>

586
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:31,446
<font color="yellow">You think she's making a deal?</font>

587
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:39,106
<font color="yellow">Why don't we do this?</font>

588
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,456

589
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:44,896

590
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:48,336
<font color="yellow"><i> What will I do if we get a guilty verdict? </i></font>

591
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:52,296
<font color="yellow"><i> Since the judge is god in this courtroom... </i></font>

592
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:56,716
<font color="yellow"><i> if god says he's guilty, we have to accept it. </i></font>

593
00:47:56,716 --> 00:48:01,896
<font color="yellow"><i> - Since we don't have eyes of god. <br> - Everyone, stand.</i></font>

594
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:05,696
<font color="yellow"><i> We can only rely on the eyes of the law. </i></font>

595
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:11,256
<font color="yellow">Everyone sit.</font>

596
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:18,536
<font color="yellow">The defendant...</font>

597
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:25,146
<font color="yellow">is not guilty.</font>

598
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:37,426
<font color="yellow">I will declare the reasons for his not guilty sentence.</font>

599
00:48:37,426 --> 00:48:44,626
<font color="yellow">The defendant, despite being unfair to him... he thought he'd be treated with consideration and...</font>

600
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:50,226
<font color="yellow">he confessed to the crime fearing the consequence he would have to experience in case he denied the crime.</font>

601
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:55,526
<font color="yellow">But the defendant was still young at the time and did not receive protection of his family or guardian.</font>

602
00:48:55,526 --> 00:49:01,526
<font color="yellow">I believe he thought he didn't have anyone who'd defend him.</font>

603
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:04,156
<font color="yellow">After the defendant arrived at the crime scene,</font>

604
00:49:04,156 --> 00:49:09,066
<font color="yellow">his testimonies regarding the circumstances were wrong and unclear.</font>

605
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:12,596
<font color="yellow">Only after the investigative team showed him a photo...</font>

606
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:18,556
<font color="yellow">he looked as though he was making his confession to match the actual chain of events...</font>

607
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:24,396
<font color="yellow">I don't acknowledge the authenticity of the defendant's confession.</font>

608
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:27,306
<font color="yellow">As a judge who doesn't have eyes of God...</font>

609
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:32,786
<font color="yellow">I daresay I have arrived at the truth of the matter in this case.</font>

610
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:36,386
<font color="yellow">However, the defendant... during the interrogation...</font>

611
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:39,936
<font color="yellow">the rights he had to exercise...</font>

612
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:44,686
<font color="yellow">and went through hardship without receiving due process of law.</font>

613
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,556
<font color="yellow">Even his last hope, the court...</font>

614
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:55,046
<font color="yellow">has no excuse for lacking serious evaluation and thought things through.</font>

615
00:49:55,046 --> 00:49:59,096
<font color="yellow">Therefore, since the statute of this case</font>

616
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,946
<font color="yellow">was applied during the time when no evidences were available...</font>

617
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:10,996
<font color="yellow">According to the criminal law article 325, latter part of the paragraph... I declare him not guilty.</font>

618
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:26,746
<font color="yellow">For the defendant who was tormented and his family, the court...</font>

619
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:33,766
<font color="yellow">conveys the apology for not reviewing the case more carefully.</font>

620
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:49,376
<font color="yellow">You're under arrest for hiring an attacker for the Suwon train station homeless girl case.</font>

<font color="yellow">Please remain silent for now.</font>

623
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:58,886
<font color="yellow">Since it's an urgent arrest, if the arrest warrant isn't issued within 48 hours, you'll be released.</font>

624
00:50:58,886 --> 00:51:01,476
<font color="yellow">Just wait until then.</font>

625
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:09,026

628
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:20,296
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm so happy! It's all because of you! Thank you!</font>

629
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:23,726
<font color="yellow">Just try and say you don't want to go to school! You'll really get it from me!</font>

630
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:26,686
<font color="yellow">- Okay. <br> - Gyeong Hwan.</font>

631
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:30,686
<font color="yellow">I gave you this as my attorney fee.</font>

638
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:56,286
<font color="yellow">You became a lawyer after struggling so much for so long. What is your reason for taking such a difficult case like this?</font>

639
00:51:56,286 --> 00:52:00,646

640
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:04,796
<font color="yellow">The judiciary has the responsibility to look at the facts of the case clearly.</font>

641

<font color="yellow">Lawyer Cha Geum Joo, do you think the same?</font>

642

<font color="yellow">The public good?</font>

644
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:21,576
<font color="yellow">When I work for my personal benefit, there are times when the good of others come about.</font>

646
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:31,846
<font color="yellow">Ah, then, you became really famous. Are you satisfied?</font>

647
00:52:31,846 --> 00:52:34,316
<font color="yellow">- Not yet. <br> - Why is that?</font>

648
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:36,886
