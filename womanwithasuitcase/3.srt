160
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,580
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

161
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,580
<font color="yellow">How can such a guy like that apply for bankruptcy?</font>

162
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,820
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

163
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
<font color="yellow">Ah! Did you come for the receipt?</font>

164
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,130
<font color="yellow">No. I came to get her.</font>

165
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,260
<font color="yellow">You're going to take my paralegal?</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's do that then.</font>

169
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,990
<font color="yellow">Ah, the smell.</font>

170
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,230
<font color="yellow">You're persistent.</font>

171
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,120
<font color="yellow">First of all, you've succeeded in provoking my competitiveness.</font>

172
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,470
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

173
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,560
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

174
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,870
<font color="yellow">There must be a cheque for a billion won in here.</font>

175
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,350
<font color="yellow">It's a contract. Call me after reading it.</font>

176
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,650
<font color="yellow">Wait! Are you not going to tell me what you're scheming?</font>

177
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,840
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to go to prison again.</font>

178
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,890
<font color="yellow">Cha Geum Joo, I won't let you go to prison.</font>

179

<font color="yellow">I will give you a week.</font>

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,470

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,250
<font color="yellow">You've worked hard.</font>

183
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,630
<font color="yellow">By chance, is he hitting on you?</font>

184
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,830
<font color="yellow">Well? I guess you can say it's something like that.</font>

185
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,930
<font color="yellow">But why are men like that?</font>

186
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,630
<font color="yellow">Why do men think that a woman's "No" means she's playing hard to get?</font>

187
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,350
<font color="yellow">I know. Why do they all do that? I don't do that though.</font>

188
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,186
<font color="yellow">If you're really bothered, you can report
him as a stalker... that's another way.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

192
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,090
<font color="yellow">You first need?</font>

193
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,160
<font color="yellow">He hit on me twice.</font>

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,560
<font color="yellow">If he comes looking for me again, he's a stalker.</font>

195
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,730
<font color="yellow">I heard the Star Palace murder case will be a jury trial?</font>

196
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,550
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's my husband?</font>

197
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,970

198

206
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,150
<font color="yellow">You get 0 points for the argument, and zilch for the evidence!</font>

207
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,490

208
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,510

<font color="yellow">Honestly, yes.</font>

232
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,010
<font color="yellow">Perhaps I am.</font>

233
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,220
<font color="yellow">But I know now.</font>

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,450
<font color="yellow">Our guess is that a cable tie was used.</font>

241
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,340
<font color="yellow">A cable tie?</font>

242
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,350
<font color="yellow">The one you use to tie up and organize electric cords?</font>

243
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

244
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,580

<font color="yellow">Also the fact that we can't
change the argument that</font>

<font color="yellow">it was in self defense due
to domestic violence.</font>

280
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,180
<font color="yellow">Attorney, you don't defend someone according to what you believe.</font>

281
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
<font color="yellow">That's right. As you said...</font>

282
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,650
<font color="yellow">Let's say the defendant tied her
sleeping husband with these cable ties.</font>

283
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,300
<font color="yellow">But what does that have to do with you?</font>

284
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,840
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

285
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,010
<font color="yellow">Paralegal, there's a regulation that
say a lawyer shouldn't cover up truth</font>

286
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,900
<font color="yellow">or make a false testimony.</font>

287
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,180
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm her defense lawyer, I can
contemplate the truthfulness of the case.</font>

288
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,840
<font color="yellow">How about a lawyer's ethics?</font>

289
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,370
<font color="yellow">Even when the lawyer finds a disadvantageous truth to the defendant,</font>

<font color="yellow">putting the defendant's benefit first,</font>

291
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,680
<font color="yellow">you have no obligation to reveal that
disadvantageous truth to the client.</font>

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,720
<font color="yellow">You know this, too.</font>

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,710
<font color="yellow">But I think differently than you.</font>

294
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,200
<font color="yellow">I believe I can defend only as much as I
believe. I must believe to defend the person.</font>

295
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,400
<font color="yellow">We have the autopsy results right here. But...</font>

296
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,580
<font color="yellow">if we deny even the fact that her husband was tied up...</font>

297
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,750
<font color="yellow">Would the jury agree with that?</font>

298
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,630
<font color="yellow">Until I can find the reason why Jo Eun Seon had to tie up her husband,</font>

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,740

<font color="yellow">Did you get rejected again?</font>

312
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,880
<font color="yellow">Is it... two outs thus far?</font>

313

314
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,100
<font color="yellow">This is interesting.</font>

315
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,340

<font color="yellow">exceeds my expectations.</font>

317
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,750
<font color="yellow">But did you tell her the reason why you opened up a law firm?</font>

318
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,080
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be better if you told her the details?</font>

319
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,110
<font color="yellow">You also had to quit being a prosecutor over similar case and...</font>

320
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,210
<font color="yellow">this homeless girl incident is extremely similar to that case.</font>

321
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,040
<font color="yellow">So, you two can combine your strengths and...</font>

322
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,390
<font color="yellow">can reveal the truth.</font>

323
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,480
<font color="yellow">What if you open up everything to her like this?</font>

324
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,320
<font color="yellow">Well? If she finds that out...</font>

325
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,490
<font color="yellow">she might want to run away even more.</font>

326
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,890
<font color="yellow">I guess... that could happen.</font>

327
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,230
<font color="yellow">My proposal to Cha Geum Joo...</font>

328
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,750
<font color="yellow">That case isn't the only reason why I asked her.</font>

329
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,960
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

330
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,950

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,420

<font color="yellow">that woman lived it up without having to work.</font>

348
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,080
<font color="yellow">She said he didn't give her any home expenses.</font>

349
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,620
<font color="yellow">Whenever she had money, she'd scoop
it all up and give it to her family.</font>

350

<font color="yellow">Then, could there be a reason why</font>

352
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,740
<font color="yellow">the defendant would want to kill your brother?</font>

353
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,990
<font color="yellow">Probably because of her son.</font>

354

<font color="yellow">Are you talking about your nephew who's studying abroad?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

363
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,290
<font color="yellow">As a result of the autopsy, did she tie him up with the cable ties?</font>

364
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,350

369
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,750
<font color="yellow">The victim was in a position where</font>

370
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,250
<font color="yellow">he couldn't not fight off defendant Jo Eun Seon when he died.</font>

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,050
<font color="yellow">No matter how threatened she felt the danger of violence,</font>

372
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,590
<font color="yellow">the fact that she asphyxiated her husband while he slept...</font>

373
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,878
<font color="yellow">You can't look at it and think the "Imminence of
the Threatened Attack" exists. Imminence of the</font>

374
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,310
<font color="yellow"><i>Threatened Attack - A condition necessary for justification
of self-defense, existence of impending danger</i></font>

375
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,940
<font color="yellow">With that, I want to settle with the defense counsel.</font>

376
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,820
<font color="yellow">For the defendant, I request 15 years for the crime of murder.</font>

377
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,390
<font color="yellow">Please give her that sentencing.</font>

378
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,080
<font color="yellow">Defense, present your final statement please.</font>

379
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,160
<font color="yellow">Defense!</font>

380
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,820
<font color="yellow">Defendant Jo Eun Seon...</font>

381
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,950
<font color="yellow">...is guilty.</font>

382
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,760
<font color="yellow">She had been struggling from domestic violence for a long time, but</font>

383
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,890
<font color="yellow">she didn't ask for help from others.</font>

384
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,780
<font color="yellow">So, she's guilty.</font>

385
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,220
<font color="yellow">The defendant is guilty.</font>

386
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,280
<font color="yellow">When Imminence of the Threatened Attack did not exist and</font>

387
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,980
<font color="yellow">the crime took place at that time so she's guilty.</font>

388
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,990
<font color="yellow">At the least, when her husband was holding a knife or a stick...</font>

389
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,090
<font color="yellow">It wasn't at the moment when he's holding his fist up but</font>

390
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,110
<font color="yellow">She's guilty for letting him die while he was sleeping.</font>

391
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,320
<font color="yellow">And crucially...</font>

392
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,250
<font color="yellow">the defendant is guilty.</font>

393
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,700
<font color="yellow">Her husband's wrists...</font>

394
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,440
<font color="yellow">His wrists...</font>

395
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,920
<font color="yellow">were tied up with something and she hid
that fact. Therefore, she's guilty.</font>

396
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,110
<font color="yellow">These are cable ties that are thought to
have been used to tie up her husband.</font>

397
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,250
<font color="yellow">Maybe, as the prosecution insisted, this murder</font>

398
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,080
<font color="yellow">didn't have the condition of Imminence of the Threatened Attack.</font>

399
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,250
<font color="yellow">This is the defendant's medical records from three months ago. Here...</font>

400
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,400
<font color="yellow">The same one that her husband did to the defendant,</font>

401
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,920
<font color="yellow">it's that tie.</font>

402
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,680
<font color="yellow">It's a record of diagnosis from 10 years ago.</font>

403
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,390
<font color="yellow">It's the same trace here.</font>

404
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,440
<font color="yellow">The idea of tying her husband in cable tie,</font>

405
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,540
<font color="yellow">where did it come from?</font>

406
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,920
<font color="yellow">I understood after finding these.</font>

407
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,590
<font color="yellow">The reason why the defendant had no other
way to protect herself other than murder,</font>

408
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,130
<font color="yellow">maybe more than the defendant's sin,</font>

409
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,430
<font color="yellow">don't you think it's proof of her fear of her husband?</font>

00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,670

483
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,220

484

487
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,780

488
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,860

court, to say that tying her husband's wrists</font>

509
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,050

593
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,540
<font color="yellow">How could there be?</font>

594
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:00,780
<font color="yellow">You're a paralegal with flaws. Like me a long time ago.</font>

595
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,920
<font color="yellow">Because what you said to me then, I worked really hard to overcome it.</font>

596
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,420
<font color="yellow">And I've come back this far.</font>

597
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,370
<font color="yellow">I hope you overcome it on your own.</font>

598
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,220
<font color="yellow">I will look into it, but it won't be easy.</font>

599
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, I should go. Bye.</font>

625
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,930

629
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,940

631

633
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,880

634
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:18,050
<font color="yellow">What would you do if I rejected you because I'm not confident enough?</font>

635
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,640
<font color="yellow">Actually, I'm not... confident enough to pass the bar.</font>

636
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:30,130

637
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,320
<font color="yellow">I took that exam, too.</font>

638
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,300
<font color="yellow">There was pressure, too.</font>

639
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,780
<font color="yellow">I'm saying you're not the only one who went through that.</font>

<font color="yellow">No, you don't know, Ham Bok Geo.</font>

641
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,780
<font color="yellow">What fear of failing means to me.</font>

642
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,870
<font color="yellow">It must be scary since the punishment is so scary.</font>

643
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,330
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see that contract?</font>

644
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,000
<font color="yellow">I thought... you got scared after reading that and rejected me.</font>

645
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,880
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

646
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know?</font>

647
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

649
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,330
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

650
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,340
<font color="yellow">It's not bad, right?</font>

651
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,670
<font color="yellow">I was more scared of getting flicked
with my fingers than taking the exam.</font>

652
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,150
<font color="yellow">Are you that a**hole's family or relative?</font>

653
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,490
<font color="yellow">Why is a public defender coming over here
asking for a settlement and whatnot?</font>

654
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,030
<font color="yellow">Settlement? I can never settle.</font>

655
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,470
<font color="yellow">I'll throw that a**hole in jail for sure.</font>

656
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,350
<font color="yellow">Alright, then I'll see you in court.</font>

657
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:08,330
<font color="yellow">And before you come, please read this.</font>

658
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,270

<font color="yellow"><i>Contract</i></font>

661
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,580

00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:26,000

663
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,630

<font color="yellow">and accompany the owner.</font>

667

<font color="yellow">You said you're a companion.</font>

668
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,390
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what's "owner" and "acquired goods?"</font>

669
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,280
<font color="yellow">An owner and servant?</font>

670
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,010
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's better than gap-eul
relationship? (SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR PARTY)</font>

671
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,900
<font color="yellow">I purposely changed it because you suddenly said no.</font>

672
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,180
<font color="yellow">Fine, let's leave it at that.</font>

673
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,730
<font color="yellow">On article 3, item 3...</font>

674
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,520
<font color="yellow">When the owner calls for the goods, within an hour if in the city...</font>

<font color="yellow">It's the KTX generation.</font>

678
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,270
<font color="yellow">This the most horrendous one.</font>

679
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,500
<font color="yellow">The goods must study things the owner requires such as...</font>

680

investment, transportation, and meals.</font>

687
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,350

752
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:34,650
<font color="yellow">I think Cha Geum Joo misunderstands your lack of talent as innocence.</font>
