00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,750
<font color="yellow">I've met you once before.</font>

158
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,750
<font color="yellow">We have?</font>

159
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,820
<font color="yellow">In the garden.</font>

160
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,220
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
-  I don't think sorry will cut it.</font>

161
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I don't know any scenes that wasn't in the book.</font>

162
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,320
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

163
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,290
<font color="yellow">Do you have a screwdriver?</font>

164
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,290
<font color="yellow">A screwdriver? Do you mean a slot or a double-slot?</font>

165
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,890
<font color="yellow">Do you want both?</font>

166
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,150
<font color="yellow">(A loud noise)</font>

167
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,050
<font color="yellow">Pardon me.</font>

168
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,430
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

169
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,690
<font color="yellow">I brought a slot and double-slot screwdrivers...</font>

170
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,090
<font color="yellow">just in case.</font>

171
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,650
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

172
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,190
<font color="yellow">It's because it's dangerous. The same thing shouldn't happen again.</font>

173
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,590
<font color="yellow">He won't come out if I destroy it completely.</font>

174
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,570
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

175
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,790
<font color="yellow">If you disassemble it, you won't be able to assemble it back.</font>

176
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,520
<font color="yellow">What if you need it again?</font>

177
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,820
<font color="yellow">That's right. You majored in computer science.</font>

178
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,620
<font color="yellow">- What happened to Oh Seong Moo?
-  Well,</font>

179
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,850
<font color="yellow">while I was gone to get some snacks,</font>

180
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,320
<font color="yellow">his face had disappeared like that.</font>

181
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,620
<font color="yellow">He was drawing like the killer told him to.</font>

182
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,390
<font color="yellow">He had a gun and the voice file.</font>

183
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,690
<font color="yellow">It wasn't just over there.</font>

184
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,720
<font color="yellow">It was such a mess here, too.</font>

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,490
<font color="yellow">Yeon Joo suddenly disappeared,</font>

186
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,250
<font color="yellow">and Mr Oh's face also disappeared.</font>

187
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,720
<font color="yellow">I was so scared that I was shuddering,</font>

188
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,150
<font color="yellow">and then you appeared suddenly.</font>

189
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,520
<font color="yellow">By the way, Chul,</font>

190
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,120
<font color="yellow">may I ask for a handshake?</font>

191
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,150
<font color="yellow">I've been your fan for a long time.</font>

192
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,550
<font color="yellow">I couldn't talk to you back then because of the situation,</font>

193
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,150
<font color="yellow">so I...</font>

194
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,050
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

195
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,220
<font color="yellow">It was me who drew the penthouse and the broadcasting station.</font>

196
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,920
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who draws those.</font>

197
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,020
<font color="yellow">I've been drawing the background for three years.</font>

198
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,080
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

199
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,450
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

200
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,990
<font color="yellow">Do you want some beer? You like beer. I have beers of all types.</font>

201
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,750
<font color="yellow">Water will do.</font>

202
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,490
<font color="yellow">I'll bring you some water. Of course I will.</font>

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,150
<font color="yellow">Goodness, this is incredible.</font>

204
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, my goodness.</font>

205
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,790
<font color="yellow">He even smells good.</font>

206
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,250
<font color="yellow">(Oh, no.)</font>

207
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,120
<font color="yellow">Here's your water.</font>

208
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,320
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Where can I find what happens after episode 34?</font>

209
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,520
<font color="yellow">- Episode 34?
-  I need to see the next one...</font>

210
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,750
<font color="yellow">to find out what's been happening.</font>

211
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,650
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

212
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,790
<font color="yellow">Is this the letter I sent?</font>

213
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, you sent it to Mr Oh.</font>

214
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,090
<font color="yellow">(Where is Kang Chul?)</font>

215
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,690
<font color="yellow">(Please give it to your father.)</font>

216
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,950
<font color="yellow">Mr Oh and I were creating a story...</font>

217
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,780
<font color="yellow">to catch the killer.</font>

218
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,490
<font color="yellow">Then that's how that happened to Mr Oh.</font>

219
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,220
<font color="yellow">What's the story you created?</font>

220
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,450
<font color="yellow">This is the storyboard.</font>

221
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,490
<font color="yellow">(You can't shoot me because you're just a set-up.)</font>

222
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,190
<font color="yellow">You're just an illusion.</font>

223
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,320
<font color="yellow">You're nothing but a character I created.</font>

224
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
<font color="yellow">Why did you appear in front of me...</font>

225
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,490
<font color="yellow">and pretending to be human?</font>

226
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,050
<font color="yellow">You're just a character, do you understand?</font>

227
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,750
<font color="yellow">You're just a set-up I created.</font>

228
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,090
<font color="yellow">How can you be a creator?</font>

229
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,890
<font color="yellow">Why did I think you were a creator?</font>

230
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,990
<font color="yellow">Why was I so upset...</font>

231
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,390
<font color="yellow">that I shot you?</font>

232
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,850
<font color="yellow">You're nothing, either.</font>

233
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,020
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

234
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,890
<font color="yellow">Take a guess.</font>

235
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,050
<font color="yellow">Guess who I am.</font>

236
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,820
<font color="yellow">How do you feel being alone in an empty world?</font>

237
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,590
<font color="yellow">You love killing people by shooting them,</font>

238
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,850
<font color="yellow">but you have no one to kill now.</font>

239
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,750
<font color="yellow">You probably can't shoot, either.</font>

240
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,720
<font color="yellow">How are you surviving?</font>

241
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,390
<font color="yellow">You can't leave again like last time...</font>

242
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,520
<font color="yellow">because I got rid of the exit.</font>

243
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,490
<font color="yellow">Isn't it better to just die?</font>

244
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,820
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me...</font>

245
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,290
<font color="yellow">- to die?
-  What's the point of living alone?</font>

246
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,020
<font color="yellow">The time would be stopped forever.</font>

247
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,050
<font color="yellow">Why would I die?</font>

248
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,120
<font color="yellow">You'll disappear first.</font>

249
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,720
<font color="yellow">You're no longer the main character. You're a murderer and a fugitive.</font>

250
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,890
<font color="yellow">You'll disappear soon.</font>

251
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,250
<font color="yellow">Once the main character disappears,</font>

252
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,590
<font color="yellow">the world keeps going again.</font>

253
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,490
<font color="yellow">All I have to do is wait for you to disappear,</font>

254
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,160
<font color="yellow">so why would I die?</font>

255
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,820
<font color="yellow">Mum?</font>

256
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,250
<font color="yellow">Was that a dream?</font>

257
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,990
<font color="yellow">Was that all a dream?</font>

258
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,920
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  Are you awake?</font>

259
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,050
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

260
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,150
<font color="yellow">Hello? Can't you hear me?</font>

261
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,550
<font color="yellow">I can hear you.</font>

262
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,950
<font color="yellow">I asked how you are. Are you all right?</font>

263
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,720
<font color="yellow">I think I am all right.</font>

264
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,060
<font color="yellow">But where are you right now?</font>

265
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,390
<font color="yellow">I'm near your father's studio.</font>

266
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,220
<font color="yellow">You're here right now?</font>

267
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,920
<font color="yellow">Are you really calling me from here?</font>

268
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,650
<font color="yellow">How can I call you from the comic?</font>

269
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,690
<font color="yellow">I just got a cellphone under Park Soo Bong's name.</font>

270
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,820
<font color="yellow">Save the number. It's mine.</font>

271
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,420
<font color="yellow">Will you continue to sleep?</font>

272
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,190
<font color="yellow">If you're feeling okay, let's go on a date.</font>

273
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,040
<font color="yellow">A date?</font>

274
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,950
<font color="yellow">While you were down for two days, I adjusted to this world.</font>

275
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,790
<font color="yellow">I also figured out what's happening. I did everything.</font>

276
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,290
<font color="yellow">Except for my marriage problem.</font>

277
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

278
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,320
<font color="yellow">It says that I am your husband,</font>

279
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,890
<font color="yellow">and I think it's certainly true. I've only read it in the comic,</font>

280
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,520
<font color="yellow">so I can't feel it.</font>

281
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,350
<font color="yellow">So I waited for you to wake up.</font>

282
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
<font color="yellow">Let's go on a date.</font>

283
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,250
<font color="yellow">You know me too well, and I don't know much about you.</font>

284
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,250
<font color="yellow">So you need to give me chances to catch up.</font>

285
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,090
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to?</font>

286
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,720
<font color="yellow">I have to go to Dad. I just woke up.</font>

287
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,250
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about your dad when we meet. I got things to say.</font>

288
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,120
<font color="yellow">You're going on a date with me, right?</font>

289
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,550
<font color="yellow">Start getting ready. I'll call you when I'm near.</font>

290
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,120
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
-  I was...</font>

291
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,950
<font color="yellow">I was just checking if it's really your number.</font>

292
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,250
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

293
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,130
<font color="yellow">But where did you get the money to buy the phone?</font>

294
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,420
<font color="yellow">I took it from Soo Bong.</font>

295
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,590
<font color="yellow">Can you pay him back for me? I borrowed a lot.</font>

296
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,120
<font color="yellow">Am I your bank or something?</font>

297
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,220
<font color="yellow">You want me to go separate ways?</font>

298
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,390
<font color="yellow">You're mean.</font>

299
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,720
<font color="yellow">Even when I was broke, I bought you clothes and ice cream.</font>

300
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,420
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything. I was just asking.</font>

301
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,420
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  When are you coming again?</font>

302
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,740
<font color="yellow">Will 30 minutes be enough?</font>

303
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,020
<font color="yellow">No. Give me an hour.</font>

304
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,750
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

305
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,450
<font color="yellow">Yes. He borrowed money.</font>

306
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,290
<font color="yellow">- 1,000 dollars.
-  1,000 dollars?</font>

307
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,490
<font color="yellow">- That's a lot.
-  Well,</font>

308
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,090
<font color="yellow">he had to buy shoes, clothes, and a mobile phone.</font>

309
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,210
<font color="yellow">He needs money to go on a date with you too.</font>

310
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,640
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you back later.</font>

311
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,250
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. I guess he will pay me.</font>

312
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,370
<font color="yellow">You can't handle it. He spends as if he's super rich.</font>

313
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,020
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm going to go bankrupt.</font>

314
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,240
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's going to happen now?</font>

315
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,250
<font color="yellow">Will he continue to live here?</font>

316
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,590
<font color="yellow">Is that possible? Can I get my money back?</font>

317
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,330
<font color="yellow">Well, it's been all right so far.</font>

318
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,850
<font color="yellow">I wonder if it's possible from now on.</font>

319
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,650
<font color="yellow">I'm normal when I'm there.</font>

320
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,560
<font color="yellow">So isn't it the same?</font>

321
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,890
<font color="yellow">By the way, do you know that?</font>

322
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,050
<font color="yellow">His hand is strange.</font>

323
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,790
<font color="yellow">Don't you have more?</font>

324
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,750
<font color="yellow">How much more?</font>

325
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,590
<font color="yellow">The more the better. I need a lot of things.</font>

326
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,350
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

327
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,050
<font color="yellow">I have more in my bank account.</font>

328
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,090
<font color="yellow">What? Your hand...</font>

329
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,290
<font color="yellow">What? Your...</font>

330
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,920
<font color="yellow">It's happening because I'm not acting like the protagonist.</font>

331
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,920
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Yeon Joo.</font>

332
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,450
<font color="yellow">Remember? Remember when So Hee was about to disappear?</font>

333
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,520
<font color="yellow">His hand turned translucent.</font>

334
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He told me not to tell you.</font>

335
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,150
<font color="yellow">I said it.</font>

336
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,490
<font color="yellow">Don't tell him that I told you about what he said.</font>

337
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,750
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later. Someone's at the door.</font>

338
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,020
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I might not get my money back.</font>

339
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,150
<font color="yellow">Mum?</font>

340
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,990
<font color="yellow">Yeon Joo.</font>

341
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,750
<font color="yellow">- Can I come in?
-  Wait.</font>

342
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,350
<font color="yellow">How... How did you come here?</font>

343
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,540
<font color="yellow">You said you were going to call me when you're near.</font>

344
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see how you live.</font>

345
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,030
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

346
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,550
<font color="yellow">I heard from Soo Bong that your mum went to work.</font>

347
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
<font color="yellow">I'm going in.</font>

348
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,550
<font color="yellow">The book lacks a lot of information.</font>

349
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,920
<font color="yellow">I have the right to know about you, you know?</font>

350
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,090
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

351
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,490
<font color="yellow">So this is where you live.</font>

352
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

353
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,850
<font color="yellow">This is where I live. It's nothing like a penthouse.</font>

354
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,950
<font color="yellow">It's nice and cosy in here.</font>

355
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,290
<font color="yellow">It's similar to my old house.</font>

356
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,090
<font color="yellow">Why did you come barging in? I'm not ready yet.</font>

357
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,590
<font color="yellow">Get ready and come out. I'll wait.</font>

358
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,260
<font color="yellow">There are beverages in the fridge. Feel free to drink them.</font>

359
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

360
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,020
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

361
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,190
<font color="yellow">Can you take off your gown?</font>

362
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,220
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

363
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,990
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

364
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,000
<font color="yellow">You're sad that I don't remember it,</font>

365
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,050
<font color="yellow">and I'm frustrated too.</font>

366
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,190
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we do everything we did in this comic?</font>

367
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,720
<font color="yellow">We should see each other in nude and kiss five times.</font>

368
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,420
<font color="yellow">There is a big gap in our relationships.</font>

369
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,720
<font color="yellow">I'm curious.</font>

370
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,320
<font color="yellow">I want to feel how Chul felt in this comic.</font>

371
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,820
<font color="yellow">You're joking, right?</font>

372
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,990
<font color="yellow">I am very serious right now.</font>

373
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,150
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

374
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,890
<font color="yellow">Take your time. I will wait for you here.</font>

375
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,590
<font color="yellow">(- Did we complete four?
-  Is it time to do the task?)</font>

376
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,890
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

377
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,750
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

378
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,290
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

379
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,850
<font color="yellow">For not forgetting me and missing me.</font>

380
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,250
<font color="yellow">We don't have a picture.</font>

381
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,650
<font color="yellow">Let's take a picture together. I regretted it a lot.</font>

382
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

383
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,150
<font color="yellow">Is she your mother? She's beautiful.</font>

384
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

385
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,990
<font color="yellow">Your husband had never been in your room, right?</font>

386
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,490
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

387
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,090
<font color="yellow">If he knew you were such a dirty person,</font>

388
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,150
<font color="yellow">he would've thought about marriage one more time.</font>

389
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,790
<font color="yellow">He's a neat-freak.</font>

390
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,950
<font color="yellow">He would've been shocked.</font>

391
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,850
<font color="yellow">It's all your fault!</font>

392
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,320
<font color="yellow">I was going mad because I thought you might be dead.</font>

393
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,390
<font color="yellow">When did I have any time to clean my room?</font>

394
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,320
<font color="yellow">And originally I am a very neat person.</font>

395
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,590
<font color="yellow">I saw everything, so I'll go down and wait.</font>

396
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,050
<font color="yellow">Come down when you are ready.</font>

397
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,290
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

398
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,190
<font color="yellow">What do you feel like eating?</font>

399
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,720
<font color="yellow">Are you going to treat me?</font>

400
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,630
<font color="yellow">You don't know any place.</font>

401
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,220
<font color="yellow">You have neither money nor friends.</font>

402
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
<font color="yellow">So I have to buy.</font>

403
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,350
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you what I think about the comic.</font>

404
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,720
<font color="yellow">Chul and Yeon Joo got married too early.</font>

405
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,450
<font color="yellow">But of course there was a situation.</font>

406
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,390
<font color="yellow">So let's go on a date,</font>

407
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,420
<font color="yellow">like other couples.</font>

408
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,420
<font color="yellow">It's funny that we're on a date when we're married.</font>

409
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,990
<font color="yellow">Let's take time to do the sweet things you like.</font>

410
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go with the flow.</font>

411
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,620
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

412
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,590
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

413
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,490
<font color="yellow">Where should we go? You can choose.</font>

414
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,990
<font color="yellow">Maybe we came too late. It's just us here.</font>

415
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,190
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

416
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,890
<font color="yellow">When do I get to have those five kisses?</font>

417
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

418
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,420
<font color="yellow">How about now? No one is around.</font>

419
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,950
<font color="yellow">That's enough joking around.</font>

420
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,450
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

421
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,720
<font color="yellow">I was joking about seeing you in nude earlier, but I'm serious now.</font>

422
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,950
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to? Is it too awkward?</font>

423
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,250
<font color="yellow">- Then we'll take it slow.
-  No...</font>

424
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,120
<font color="yellow">Why would it be awkward?</font>

425
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,520
<font color="yellow">Then can I do it?</font>

426
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,650
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

427
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,220
<font color="yellow">You can...</font>

428
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,750
<font color="yellow">Is this how it feels?</font>

429
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,020
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

430
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,050
<font color="yellow">- I get it.
-  Get what?</font>

431
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,890
<font color="yellow">How does it feel?</font>

432
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,020
<font color="yellow">No comments.</font>

433
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,490
<font color="yellow">No comments?</font>

434
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,420
<font color="yellow">It's delicious. I'm glad you picked this place.</font>

435
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,290
<font color="yellow">Are you mad? Why aren't you talking?</font>

436
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,520
<font color="yellow">Your hand.</font>

437
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,650
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

438
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,490
<font color="yellow">I know you've been hiding it from me since earlier.</font>

439
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,950
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you after we finished.</font>

440
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,590
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

441
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,350
<font color="yellow">eat.</font>

442
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,420
<font color="yellow">It's been like this for about a month...</font>

443
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,420
<font color="yellow">ever since Mr Son died.</font>

444
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,260
<font color="yellow">- What are we going to do?
-  Take care of it.</font>

445
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,620
<font color="yellow">How are we going to take care of it?</font>

446
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,090
<font color="yellow">I've talked to your father a lot since then.</font>

447
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,650
<font color="yellow">With my father?</font>

448
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,390
<font color="yellow">I didn't know which one was Oh Seong Moo, so I met both.</font>

449
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,850
<font color="yellow">That's how I knew why our plan failed.</font>

450
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,920
<font color="yellow">No. No, no...</font>

451
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,850
<font color="yellow">Please don't kill me.</font>

452
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
<font color="yellow">Don't kill me.</font>

453
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,560
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

454
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,750
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to kill Kang Chul.</font>

455
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,750
<font color="yellow">Why did you kill him?</font>

456
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,920
<font color="yellow">(Why did you kill him?)</font>

457
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,920
<font color="yellow">How are you alive when you've been stabbed?</font>

458
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,590
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

459
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,390
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

460
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,320
<font color="yellow">Don't be so conceited.</font>

461
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,520
<font color="yellow">I found out before you did.</font>

462
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,250
<font color="yellow">Oh Seong Moo promised me then...</font>

463
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,250
<font color="yellow">to make me a face.</font>

464
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,190
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

465
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,990
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

466
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,790
<font color="yellow">You'll be the protagonist. I'll turn you into the protagonist.</font>

467
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,690
<font color="yellow">No, it's not hard to do.</font>

468
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,950
<font color="yellow">I can make it happen. Please...</font>

469
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,420
<font color="yellow">He told me I'd become the protagonist if I get rid of you.</font>

470
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,220
<font color="yellow">He promised me,</font>

471
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,690
<font color="yellow">but he betrayed me as soon as he returned.</font>

472
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,650
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

473
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,790
<font color="yellow">That's why I ate him.</font>

474
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,250
<font color="yellow">For breaking his promise.</font>

475
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,700
<font color="yellow">What does...</font>

476
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,090
<font color="yellow">There's something your father failed to tell me.</font>

477
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,920
<font color="yellow">He had already met the killer that day.</font>

478
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,020
<font color="yellow">They also had made a promise.</font>

479
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,190
<font color="yellow">That's why it didn't work when we tried to turn it into a dream.</font>

480
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,990
<font color="yellow">He was aware of his identity, and my memories were erased.</font>

481
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,720
<font color="yellow">It's my mistake.</font>

482
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,840
<font color="yellow">I chose the wrong point in time to turn into a dream.</font>

483
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,090
<font color="yellow">That's why things got messy.</font>

484
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

485
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,150
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

486
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,950
<font color="yellow">Let's make a promise.</font>

487
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,990
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

488
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,290
<font color="yellow">When you go to the studio,</font>

489
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,290
<font color="yellow">draw me a picture.</font>

490
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,920
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? What now?</font>

491
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,190
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to turn this into a dream all over again?</font>

492
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,020
<font color="yellow">Then you'll disappear from here.</font>

493
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,290
<font color="yellow">It's easy for you since you'll forget about me and live on,</font>

494
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,390
<font color="yellow">but I have to stay here by myself and repeat the memories again.</font>

495
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,890
<font color="yellow">If you were going to be like this,</font>

496
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,490
<font color="yellow">why did you ask me to date?</font>

497
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,350
<font color="yellow">Why did you kiss me just now?</font>

498
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,060
<font color="yellow">- I never mentioned dreams.
-  That's what you're trying to say.</font>

499
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,390
<font color="yellow">You want to turn back time to before the killer knew...</font>

500
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,750
<font color="yellow">about his identity so that everyone is safe.</font>

501
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,090
<font color="yellow">That's what the cartoon's Kang Chul said.</font>

502
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,590
<font color="yellow">That's not my plan.</font>

503
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,020
<font color="yellow">We were in a bind. We didn't have a choice then.</font>

504
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,950
<font color="yellow">Now, we have time to think.</font>

505
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,350
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live the same life over again either.</font>

506
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,490
<font color="yellow">Nor do I want you to have these repeating memories.</font>

507
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,390
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

508
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,720
<font color="yellow">what do you want me to draw?</font>

509
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,060
<font color="yellow">Draw this for me.</font>

510
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,090
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

511
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,060
<font color="yellow">I think the killer has to die for your dad to return.</font>

512
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,090
<font color="yellow">Since I'm no longer the protagonist,</font>

513
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,590
<font color="yellow">I might disappear again.</font>

514
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,020
<font color="yellow">There is only one solution.</font>

515
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,420
<font color="yellow">It's the story your father and I had planned from the beginning.</font>

516
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,790
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

517
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,120
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

518
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,590
<font color="yellow">How are the kids?</font>

519
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,520
<font color="yellow">We have to catch the killer and make Han Cheol Ho kill him.</font>

520
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,560
<font color="yellow">That's the best way. We must make it happen.</font>

521
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,020
<font color="yellow">It's the only way for your father and I to live.</font>

522
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,150
<font color="yellow">Although,</font>

523
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,060
<font color="yellow">I want to change the ending your father wrote.</font>

524
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,350
<font color="yellow">In the end,</font>

525
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,120
<font color="yellow">Kang Chul and Oh Yeon Joo should get married and live happily.</font>

526
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,690
<font color="yellow">That would be the best ending for W.</font>

527
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,350
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

528
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,560
<font color="yellow">I don't care what the readers think.</font>

529
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,950
<font color="yellow">I realised after I saw your father.</font>

530
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,820
<font color="yellow">Oh Seong Moo is not a creator.</font>

531
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,560
<font color="yellow">He thought he was and that's why this happened to him.</font>

532
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,890
<font color="yellow">It's impossible for him to have created everything in that world.</font>

533
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,090
<font color="yellow">How can a writer make up billions of characters?</font>

534
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,750
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense.</font>

535
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,950
<font color="yellow">What he could control was the few he designed himself.</font>

536
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,220
<font color="yellow">That's why I came to this conclusion.</font>

537
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,190
<font color="yellow">The comic book is only a pathway to connect the two worlds.</font>

538
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,420
<font color="yellow">This world and that world are each independent.</font>

539
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,890
<font color="yellow">Two different worlds.</font>

540
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,350
<font color="yellow">- Where does the killer live?
-  Pardon me?</font>

541
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,250
<font color="yellow">There must be a place. Is there any photo you used as a reference?</font>

542
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,820
<font color="yellow">There are photos of an apartment I used.</font>

543
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,190
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

544
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,320
<font color="yellow">Was the killer's address mentioned in the webtoon?</font>

545
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,950
<font color="yellow">No, because things happened before I drew anything.</font>

546
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,860
<font color="yellow">That's why the police couldn't find him.</font>

547
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,950
<font color="yellow">These are the photos of the apartment I used.</font>

548
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,350
<font color="yellow">(Sungha Apartment in Mungye-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul)</font>

549
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,420
<font color="yellow">What the two worlds share in common are things in the webtoon...</font>

550
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,560
<font color="yellow">including me, a few other characters...</font>

551
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,190
<font color="yellow">and certain locations and things that are set up.</font>

552
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,320
<font color="yellow">Two worlds came together via Oh Seong Moo's tablet.</font>

553
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,690
<font color="yellow">I left via the tablet,</font>

554
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,660
<font color="yellow">but there were variables.</font>

555
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,020
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
-  The characters became aware.</font>

556
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,240
<font color="yellow">Yeon Joo.</font>

557
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,820
<font color="yellow">Depending on which characters became aware,</font>

558
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,190
<font color="yellow">people in real life were called upon.</font>

559
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,920
<font color="yellow">They were kicked out when one episode ended.</font>

560
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,090
<font color="yellow">Variables continued to appear,</font>

561
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,890
<font color="yellow">and because of that, you've been used so far.</font>

562
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,020
<font color="yellow">You've been used enough.</font>

563
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,750
<font color="yellow">It's time that we use the variables to our advantage.</font>

564
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,320
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat?</font>

565
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,100
<font color="yellow">- A hamburger.
-  A hamburger?</font>

566
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,550
<font color="yellow">Let's go get some hamburgers.</font>

567
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,420
<font color="yellow">I chose apartment number 815. There's no particular reason.</font>

568
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,190
<font color="yellow">10 minutes will be enough.</font>

569
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,450
<font color="yellow">After 10 minutes, turn it on.</font>

570
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,250
<font color="yellow">I'm in reality.</font>

571
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,020
<font color="yellow">At the same time, I'm one of the characters.</font>

572
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,920
<font color="yellow">If a character can call someone in reality,</font>

573
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,320
<font color="yellow">my first hypothesis is...</font>

574
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,390
<font color="yellow">that I can pull myself back into the world of the webtoon.</font>

575
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,050
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll summon myself.</font>

576
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,990
<font color="yellow">Here,</font>

577
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,950
<font color="yellow">the world of the webtoon.</font>

578
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,900
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is 112.</font>

579
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,490
<font color="yellow">I'd like to report a suspect for murder.</font>

580
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,320
<font color="yellow">I'm listening. Which murder case are you referring to?</font>

581
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,790
<font color="yellow">I caught the killer of the shooting at Channel W.</font>

582
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,220
<font color="yellow">Please arrest him.</font>

583
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,290
<font color="yellow">Okay, please wait one moment.</font>

584
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,690
<font color="yellow">The address is Sungha Apartment 2-815, 216-13...</font>

585
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,070
<font color="yellow">Mungye-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul.</font>

586
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,240
<font color="yellow">His name is Han Sang Hoon.</font>

587
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,120
<font color="yellow">We'll leave now and check.</font>

588
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,720
<font color="yellow">Could you identify yourself?</font>

589
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,090
<font color="yellow">I'm just a citizen.</font>

590
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,620
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

591
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,720
<font color="yellow">Sir, we received an important report.</font>

592
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,690
<font color="yellow">Which one of us will die first?</font>

593
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,990
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be you.</font>

594
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,190
<font color="yellow">Since I caught the killer, it will take some time for me to disappear.</font>

595
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,750
<font color="yellow">I completed one of the main character's tasks.</font>

596
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,520
<font color="yellow">You scum.</font>

597
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,250
<font color="yellow">Rot in the detention centre for a while.</font>

598
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,990
<font color="yellow">I'll think about how to kill you.</font>

599
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,600
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

600
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,650
<font color="yellow">Once you leave here, go to the office and draw this.</font>

601
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,720
<font color="yellow">I assembled the tablet.</font>

602
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,990
<font color="yellow">No. You already know.</font>

603
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:29,790
<font color="yellow">If I turn it on, the killer...</font>

604
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,520
<font color="yellow">That's why we must catch the killer so he won't be free.</font>

605
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,390
<font color="yellow">I'll stop him from getting his hands...</font>

606
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,320
<font color="yellow">on the tablet.</font>

607
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,090
<font color="yellow">First, draw the car I'll ride.</font>

608
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,990
<font color="yellow">Check his identity.</font>

609
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,650
<font color="yellow">He looks like him.</font>

610
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,410
<font color="yellow">We caught the killer of the shooting.</font>

611
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,520
<font color="yellow">Please send us the support.</font>

612
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,110
<font color="yellow">All right, that's enough. Let's stop the interview now.</font>

613
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,150
<font color="yellow">I'm a little tired.</font>

614
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,710
<font color="yellow">Sir, the killer of the shooting got arrested.</font>

615
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,720
<font color="yellow">Wait a moment.</font>

616
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,120
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Where?</font>

617
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,990
<font color="yellow">He was arrested in his apartment in Dobong-gu.</font>

618
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,830
<font color="yellow">- How?
-  Someone reported to the police.</font>

619
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,990
<font color="yellow">Who are you talking about?</font>

620
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,170
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Isn't it President Kang?</font>

621
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,220
<font color="yellow">The one who reported him.</font>

622
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,220
<font color="yellow">The police said his voice was similar to his.</font>

623
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,650
<font color="yellow">What if he's alive?</font>

624
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,050
<font color="yellow">I think he's alive.</font>

625
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,520
<font color="yellow">It's definitely President Kang.</font>

626
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,090
<font color="yellow">Perhaps. We should find out more about it.</font>

627
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

628
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,850
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

629
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,420
<font color="yellow">How does it make sense? He was certainly there.</font>

630
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,230
<font color="yellow">At around 10:30pm,</font>

631
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,130
<font color="yellow">the suspect who killed 10 people at a shooting at Channel W office...</font>

632
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,790
<font color="yellow">was arrested at his home.</font>

633
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,870
<font color="yellow">The suspect hasn't been identified yet.</font>

634
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,820
<font color="yellow">He was reported by a courageous citizen.</font>

635
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,850
<font color="yellow">The anonymous citizen went into the suspect's house,</font>

636
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,720
<font color="yellow">and after a fight, he reported...</font>

637
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,890
<font color="yellow">The second you must draw is...</font>

638
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,990
<font color="yellow">my dead body in decay.</font>

639
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,820
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

640
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,050
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
-  Did you see the news?</font>

641
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,650
<font color="yellow">So Hee thinks it's you who caught the killer.</font>

642
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, I caught him.</font>

643
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,790
<font color="yellow">What? Is it true?</font>

644
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,250
<font color="yellow">- How did you do it?
-  Do Yoon, listen carefully.</font>

645
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,320
<font color="yellow">Go to my house where I was 15 days ago.</font>

646
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,420
<font color="yellow">Then you'll find my body.</font>

647
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,020
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

648
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,550
<font color="yellow">Report it to the police and let everyone know.</font>

649
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,390
<font color="yellow">The body's DNA will match mine.</font>

650
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,550
<font color="yellow">Do Yoon, I'm dead.</font>

651
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,150
<font color="yellow">I got shot and died unjustly with a false charge.</font>

652
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,390
<font color="yellow">However, I'm still alive, so don't worry.</font>

653
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,890
<font color="yellow">I thought you should know.</font>

654
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,650
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  It's better that...</font>

655
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,550
<font color="yellow">So Hee thinks I'm dead.</font>

656
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,520
<font color="yellow">It's for her own good.</font>

657
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,020
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

658
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,390
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

659
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,590
<font color="yellow">what about So Hee?</font>

660
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,250
<font color="yellow">If it's a happy ending for us,</font>

661
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,590
<font color="yellow">she'll disappear again.</font>

662
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,120
<font color="yellow">- I'll create a variable for her.
-  A variable?</font>

663
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,650
<font color="yellow">I can't accept the fact that there's only one reason...</font>

664
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:16,750
<font color="yellow">for our existence.</font>

665
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,450
<font color="yellow">When there's a variable, the direction of one's life changes...</font>

666
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,420
<font color="yellow">like how I met you.</font>

667
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,050
<font color="yellow">If her fate is determined only because she's one of the characters,</font>

668
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,090
<font color="yellow">we'll free her.</font>

669
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,620
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm going to the police station now.</font>

670
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,120
<font color="yellow">I heard the voice, and I think it's him,</font>

671
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,150
<font color="yellow">so right now, I...</font>

672
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,290
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

673
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,820
<font color="yellow">He died?</font>

674
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,390
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get rid of...</font>

675
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,490
<font color="yellow">the set-up for So Hee.</font>

676
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,090
<font color="yellow">On 23rd, the police announced...</font>

677
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,720
<font color="yellow">that a dead body found in Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Provice...</font>

678
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,550
<font color="yellow">was identified as Kang Chul.</font>

679
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,220
<font color="yellow">On 22nd of last month,</font>

680
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,720
<font color="yellow">Kang was on a flee under the charge of killing the director of WBN.</font>

681
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,250
<font color="yellow">After 33 days of fleeing, he was found dead.</font>

682
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,050
<font color="yellow">Kang was shot by the police while fleeing...</font>

683
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,990
<font color="yellow">How can you come back?</font>

684
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,090
<font color="yellow">Once you leave now, it's over.</font>

685
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:50,720
<font color="yellow">You can't come back here.</font>

686
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,620
<font color="yellow">I think I can.</font>

687
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,690
<font color="yellow">It was only possible when you became aware.</font>

688
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,590
<font color="yellow">That means you have to come back after losing all of your memories.</font>

689
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,390
<font color="yellow">- Then, it'll only be a dream.
-  I don't want dreams any more.</font>

690
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,220
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

691
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,890
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be possible. Wait here for me.</font>

692
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,250
<font color="yellow">You also said that last time.</font>

693
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,220
<font color="yellow">You told me to wait until the operation is over,</font>

694
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,850
<font color="yellow">but you disappeared.</font>

695
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,920
<font color="yellow">That's Kang Chul in the comic.</font>

696
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,390
<font color="yellow">There's one more thing I'd like you to draw.</font>

697
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:25,020
<font color="yellow">It's too expensive here, and I couldn't afford it.</font>

698
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,250
<font color="yellow">Draw me the ring I lost.</font>

699
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,290
<font color="yellow">My second hypothesis is...</font>

700
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,050
<font color="yellow">that I've been called into reality.</font>

701
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,390
<font color="yellow">Therefore, when the mission in one episode is accomplished,</font>

702
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,050
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

703
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,790
<font color="yellow">go back.</font>

704
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,590
<font color="yellow">(To be continued)</font>

705
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,090
<font color="yellow">(Kang Chul)</font>

706
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,450
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

707
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,320
<font color="yellow">I came back.</font>

708
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,520
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

709
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,690
<font color="yellow">I'm coming to you now.</font>

710
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,050
<font color="yellow">Get ready so that we finish our date.</font>

711
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,020
<font color="yellow">Let's finish our fifth kiss.</font>

712
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,790
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

713
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,650
<font color="yellow">I can't stand losing.</font>

714
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,620
<font color="yellow">I can't let your ex-husband defeat me.</font>

715
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,050
<font color="yellow">That's a strange competition.</font>

716
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,090
<font color="yellow">Are you competing with someone?</font>

717
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,350
<font color="yellow">You'll find out soon that I'm much better.</font>

718
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,150
<font color="yellow">(W)</font>

719
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,120
<font color="yellow">Oh Yeon Joo, the character I'm tired of...</font>

720
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,190
<font color="yellow">appears again.</font>

721
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,020
<font color="yellow">W is no longer a webtoon. I abandoned it.</font>

722
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,220
<font color="yellow">Hope makes me imagine again.</font>

723
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,990
<font color="yellow">As Chul came back to me,</font>

724
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,990
<font color="yellow">W ended with a happy ending.</font>

725
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,520
<font color="yellow">I heard Han Sang Hoon escaped from prison.</font>

726
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,020
<font color="yellow">You're Chul's family. The purpose of my existence is to get rid of you.</font>

727
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,720
<font color="yellow">No one asked you to be the female lead in this comic.</font>

728
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,050
<font color="yellow">Did you think it'd be a happy ending?</font>

729
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,850
<font color="yellow">What happened to the woman who was here?</font>

730
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,950
<font color="yellow">This is the last episode of W.</font>
