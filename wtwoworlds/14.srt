Charge it at 150 joules.

53
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,920
Excuse me. Excuse me. I would like to ask something.

54
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,840
Who is it?

55
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,000
Well... perhaps... is there an injured woman?

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,770
Ah, that lady? The ambulance took her earlier.

57
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,280
I think everything is alright, Teacher, since they brought her to the hospital right away.

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,080

No. It can't be.

61
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,610
They said Kang Cheol went to get her.

62
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,620

The surgery went well.

77
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,330
But... prior to the surgery, there was a temporary cardiac arrest caused by excessive hemorrhage while she was in ER.

78
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,570
We've performed CPR for over 30 minutes.

79
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,300
She isn't conscious as of yet.

80
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,020
She is not conscious, her pupils are dilated a bit, and there is no reflex.

81
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,300
Then?

82
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,770

- Brain dead?<br>- It's still not a sure state,

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,690

Ah, look at them.

102
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,820
Why isn't she coming home?

103
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,130
This girl hasn't coming home early lately.

104
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,900
Isn't she dating?

105
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,170
Um... it's her mother.

106
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,800
Teacher, what should I tell her?

107
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,910
Tell her you don't know.

108
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,620
Yes, Mother.

109
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,930
Oh, Soo Bong?

110
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,150
Yes, I'm Soo Bong.

111
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,570
Noona left her cell phone at her dad's workshop.

112
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,510
Why did she leave her phone there?

113
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,820
S...she was hanging out here, and then

114
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,550
she got called into work and went to the hospital.

115
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,220
When she contacts me, I'll tell her to call home.

116
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,900
Ah, I'm not feeling that well. Yes.

117
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,230

Ah, yes.

123
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,940
- Is the writer inside?<br>- Yes.

124
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,190
But, Hyung Kang, what happened to Noona Yeon Joo?

125
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,330
Hyung Kang. Hyung Kang!

126
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,180
Hyung Kang, what about Noona? Noona...

127
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,810
I see you returned.

128
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,400
What about Yeon Joo?

129
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,280
What about Noona?

130
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,380
I took her there.

131
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,220
Why?

132
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,280
What for?

133
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,980
Since they said there was no hope.

134
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,790
If something goes wrong here, there is no turning back.

135
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:24,040
She stayed at the hospital for 3 days. Even there, they said there was no hope, so I moved her to a hotel.

136
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,210
Because I couldn't explain about the gunshot.

137
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,690
She spent another week there.

138
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,270
She opened her eyes just once.

139
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,450

Very briefly.

142
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,280
And so?

143
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,150
What about now?

144
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,990
She's dead.

145
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,360
Teacher. Teacher!

146
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,930
Teacher, are you okay?

147
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,180
Ah, Teacher!

148
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,800

149
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,660
You came?

150
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,390
I heard Writer Oh got hospitalized.

151
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,950
- Yes, early in the morning.<br>- Why?

152
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,250
I heard he was under a lot of stress.

153
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,260
Ah, also, I heard he took medication along with alcohol, but he is alright now.

154
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,430
Ah! I feel so uneasy and am going nuts!

155
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,260
- Why?<br>- I...

156
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,930
I submitted some negative comments online, stating that he shouldn't write the webtoon so shabby like that.

157
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,910
I mixed in some cuss words...

158
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,190
Could he have drank after reading those comments and getting stressed?

159
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,730
- That's possible.<br>- Aish!

160
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,870
What's the room number?

161
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,460

162
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,020

Ah, yes.

164
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,600
Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,320
Hyung, one moment.

166
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,050
Sir, this is Park Min Soo. I operated on you before. You remember me, right?

167
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,750
Sir, I asked you to stop drinking alcohol at that time, but why did you?

168
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,910
No matter how hard your work is, you really shouldn't do this.

169
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,310
Shouldn't Oh Yeon Joo...

170
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,490
Where did she go? Why isn't she looking after you?

171
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,850
Oh, right, sir. There is something I'm curious about.

172
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,360
Why did Oh Yeon Joo suddenly die?

173
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,120
I mean, she was kind of a useless character, but still...

174
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,960
Her dying that way left me feeling bad.

175
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,190
Of course, a tragically sad ending isn't bad, either.

176
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,770
What's wrong? What's wrong? What are you doing? Sir!

177
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,330
Sir! Ex... Excuse me...

178
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,330
Let go! Let go!

179
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,510
Why are you doing this?

180
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,930
I did it. I was the one who shot.

181
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,830
I shot Yeon Joo. It was me who shot her.

182
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,230
- You did not shoot her.<br>- No.

183
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,450
I did shoot her.

184
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I remember it all.

185
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,320
I shot my daughter.

186
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,930
No. That's not you.

187
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,390
I... can no longer live.

188
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,560
I can not live anymore.

189
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,930
Get yourself together and listen to me!

190
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,640
Do you know why I sought for you? It's because you have something to do.

191
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,030
Don't blame yourself. You did not shoot your daughter but the real culprit did.

192
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,650
But the only one who could save her is only you.

193
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,660
That's why you should get yourself together. You can't break down.

194
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,410
You need to save your daughter!

195
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,590
How could I save her? She's dead.

196
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,150
She did die, but you can save her.

197
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeon Joo became a half-way comic character like me when she got married to me.

198
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,050
So she gets hurt and bleeds in the manhwa (comic), and that is why she died after being shot.

199
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,050
But instead, because she became a manhwa character

200
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,980
you can save her by drawing. Just like how I was brought to life after being dead.

201
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,420
Do you understand?

202
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,040
With your drawing, you can make her alive.

203
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,380
That is why, before she died I brought her inside the manhwa world.

204
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,890
It's not the end yet.

205
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,440
I will never give up. I will, with no fail

206
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,620
save her.

207
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,840
How could I draw? It's all crushed.

208
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,620
I broke it with a hammer because that bastard told me to.

209
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,370
That bastard told me so I crushed it all.

210
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,260
There isn't a tablet anymore.

211
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,310
There is.

212
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,820
There is one for sure. Somewhere.

213
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,290
Where did he go?

214
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,070
That... but why did he suddenly go out? What did you say?

215
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,370
Well, I didn't say anything much.

216
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,690
I just asked something about the manhwa

217
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,280
and when I asked why Oh Yeon Joo died, and he just suddenly...

218
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,230
Why? What's wrong?

219
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,860
Sheesh! Why would you ask that? Why!

220
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,990
There are other things to ask! Why did you ask that to a patient! Are you in your right mind?

221
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,340
As a doctor, you have no mannerism, and can't even get a hint about the situation!

222
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,510
Why did you ask that kind of thing! Why!

223
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,010
Do you have any thoughts or not! Oh, Teacher.

224
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,940
- Call a nurse. <br>- Please call a nurse.

225
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,830
Teacher. Teacher. Teacher, are you alright? Teacher!

226
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,010
What is this? Did I do something so wrong?

227
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,820
Can't I ask why a manhwa character died?

228
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,140
What should I do? I think I'm hurt.

229
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,030
I will be going back now.

230
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,520
Please take care of him.

231
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,190
<i>You probably don't know what Oh Yeon Joo means to me.</i>

232
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,770
<i>Yeon Joo is my only family.</i>

233
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,550
<i>Not the fake family that you made but a true family that has substance.</i>

234
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,160
<i>Not with those fabricated memories but actual memories that we shared together.</i>

235
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,970
<i>Not a predetermined fate but a fate that I chose myself.</i>

236
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,280
<i>For the first time, only with my own will.</i>

237
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,320
<i>That's why, I can't give up.</i>

238
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:04,210
<i>Yeon Joo... is the proof that I'm human, just like you and her</i>

239
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,220
<i>That I am a human being.</i>

240
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,140
<i>That's why I will surely save your daughter and be happy together.</i>

241
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,250
<i>This time I won't back up.</i>

242
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,960
<i>Nobody can make me despair.</i>

243
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,170
<i>I will come from behind and win for sure. And the ending will be...</i>

244
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,720
<i>a happy ending no matter what.</i>

245
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,690
<i>Oh right, now your life is important to me too.</i>

246
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,040
<i>Not as the god who made me but as the father of my wife.</i>

247
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,600
<i>You are already my family.</i>

248
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,020
<i>You might not acknowledge it, but that's how it is to me.</i>

249
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,140
<i>That's why, don't do things like what you did earlier, please! Okay?</i>

250
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,090
Arrogant punk.

251
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,630
Hyung.

252
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,910
Please be careful.

253
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,430
Honestly, I'm going crazy.

254
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,760
Don't cry and wait. I might call for help.

255
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,590
To me? What?

256
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,700
I don't know yet, either.

257
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,120
Be careful, okay?

258
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,390
<i>How could there be another one?</i>

259
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,740
<i>Until now, I only used one tablet.</i>

260
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,150
<i>There must be a replacement.</i>

261
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,100
<i>If not, there's no way the real culprit would have broken it.</i>

262
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,920
<i>That is the most important thing to him</i>

263
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,360
<i>Hey, draw that first.</i>

264
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,590
<i>Your tablet.</i>

265
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,530
<i>He just had it crushed so that we could never use it.</i>

266
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,580
<i>There must be a copy drawn somewhere in the manhwa.</i>

267
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,100
<i>If not, he wouldn't have recklessly disposed of it.</i>

268
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,610
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

269
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,820
<i>I put it in the trunk.</i>

270
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,490
<i>Trunk of the car?</i>

271
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,270
<i>When the police looked for evidence, there was no tablet.</i>

272
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,560
<i>- Han Cheol Ho.<br>- Han Cheol Ho.</i>

273
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,700
This is used by illustrators.

274
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
It's used for drawing.

275
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,170
Drawing?

276
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,290
Yes. If it's this kind, it's one that a professional would use.

277
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,960
How do you do it?

278
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,060
With this, you can just draw like with a pencil.

279
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,030
This is the electronic pen.

280
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,730
Why would he have something like this in his trunk? It's not even a weapon.

281
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,680
- Pardon?<br>- Nothing.

282
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,750
Assemblyman, Assemblymen Park is calling and asking when you are coming.

283
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,730
- Tell him I will be there soon.<br>- Yes.

284
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,320
Hello? Yes.

285
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,430
Turn it off for now.

286
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,480
<i>But the copy will have the same functionality?</i>

287
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,830
<i>We won't know. We need to use it to know what's different.</i>

288
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,100
<i>But still, we have to find it.</i>

289
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,250
<i>First, we must.</i>

290
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,500
It's not the same one. <i>It's a trap!</i>

291
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,790
Hey, Kang Cheol.

292
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,460
Is this what you are looking for?

293
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,990
Wow! It's been a really long time for us to be meeting like this again, isn't it?

294
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,080
Ever since Kang Cheol became CEO Kang Cheol, I couldn't touch you at all.

295
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,000
But now,

296
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,480
you are dead. You've put up a show on your own that you are dead.

297
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,760
So even if you die here again,

298
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,160
no one will say anything. You're already dead.

299
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,000
Even if I kill you here right now,

300
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,190
I won't be found guilty of anything.

301
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,530
Huh?! You dug your grave, jerk! Do you get it?!

302
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,800
Does it still feel foggy? Are you still out of it?

303
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,130
Hey.

304
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,560
Aren't you curious where I got that injection?

305
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,340
It's fascinating, right?

306
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,010
How can there be something like that?

307
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,400
<i>For now, turn it off.</i>

308
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,190
<i>Yes.</i>

309
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,530
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

310
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,970
<i>Tell him to put the car back in. I'm going to take a look at this first before leaving.</i>

311
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,380
<i>Yes.</i>

312
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,310
<i>What is this, eh?</i>

313
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,040
<i>This jerk. He really is a nut job!</i>

314
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,470
<i>As he draws, he is having fantasies.</i>

315
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,440
<i>Were you trying to make a terrorist group or something, Kang Cheol?</i>

316
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,500
<i>What is this?</i>

317
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,540
<i>Revolver</i>

318
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,400
What the-

319
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,110
Not just revolvers. There are all kinds of medications!

320
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,470
Natrium Amytal. Scopolamine, Sodium Pentothal.

321
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,090
Amphetamin, Mescaline. There!

322
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,360
Which injection should I give you? What do you want?

323
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,980
Sodium?

324
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,230
<i>Sodium Pentothal</i>

325
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,460
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the Cassiopeia Team @ Viki</i>

326
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,430
My CEO Kang Cheol.

327
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,810
In case you die of drug overdose,

328
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,700
I let you live.

329
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,880
You were appearing and disappearing suddenly, acting like Hong Gil Dong <i>(Legendary fictional hero)</i>.

330
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,930
Now that you are drugged up, even that must be hard, too.

331
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,690
Isn't it a type of story that would come out in a manhwa or something?

332
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,220
If you press "Enter," it appears; if you press 'Delete," it disappears again.

333
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,150
Why you were in a gun fight against Han Sang Hoon,

334
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,550
now I understand.

335
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,050
But,

336
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,300
what I'm really curious about is,

337
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,680
what on earth is this? This!

338
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,590
From now, these are the questions you have to answer.

339
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,750
Where did Han Sang Hoon get that and what is your relationship with him?

340
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,750
How did you know I have that?

341
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,780
Who is the original owner of that thing?

342
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,630
Who is the woman who disappears after getting shot at the scene?

343
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,150
How can you come into my office so easily?

344
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,850
Let's start.

345
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,620
This is the price for tormenting me for the past 10 years.

346
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,900
Ah, this bastard.

347
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,950
Hey. Hey, you won't talk? Huh?

348
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,230
Hey! Huh?

349
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,930
Hey!

350
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,710
- Yes.<br>- <i>Why aren't you coming?</i>

351
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,580
Ah, I have something to take care of.

352
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,060
Yes, I'll be right there.

353
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,390
That's right. Since you were young,

354
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,880
you were pretty good at keeping your mouth shut, weren't you?

355
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,910
But it will be a bit different this time. You should know,

356
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,630
what is in here, too.

357
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,130
You'd better be prepared.

358
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,890
Hospital.

359
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,160
What?

360
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,460
Hospital.

361
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,480
Say that again. What did you say?

362
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,900
I have to take it to the hospital.

363
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,550
What about the hospital? Say it louder.

364
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,760
Why isn't he contacting me again?

365
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,100
Aish, I should have quit.

366
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,130
It's uploaded! It's uploaded again!

367
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,760
Please. Please, please, please.

371
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,320
Aish! I told him to be careful! Ah!

372
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,020
So you are telling me

373
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,680
to believe what you said.

374
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,290
It's true.

375
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,760
- Go inside and watch over him.<br>- Yes.

376
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, he is a dead guy already.

377
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,710
It doesn't matter if he dies, so don't even give him a sip of water.

378
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,550
I understand.

379
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,550
It's me.

380
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,480
Tell him that I have and urgent matter to take care of so I have to stop by somewhere.

381
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,460
What time is it right now?

382
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,200
What?

383
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Just tell me what time it is. What time is it?

384
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,630
It's 2:30.

385
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,300
2:30?

386
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,130
Then, thirty minutes have passed.

387
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,320
It's about time for it to arrive.

388
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,910
What?

389
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,150
Park Soo Bong, material is going there.

390
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,320

391
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,860

395
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,490
Is he calling out to me?

396
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,550
<i>Don't cry and wait. I might send out an SOS.</i>

397
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,270
Is this it? Is this it?

398
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,150
Is this it? Is this it?

399
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,890
You are going to carry that? It's heavy. Let me carry it.

400
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,230
That's fine. Lead the way.

401
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,820
Yes.

402
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,320
Teacher! Teacher!

403
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,050
Teacher!

404
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,430
W..webtoon has been uploaded.

405
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,310
What?

406
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,600
Did something go wrong? To him, too?

407
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,870
I'm not sure whether it went wrong or not.

408
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,320
Hyung is almost dying.

409
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,110
Teacher, look at this.

410
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,150
He sent me a message.

411
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,590
He put this message for me to see, right? He said the material is coming here.

412
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,960
What could the material be? What is the material?

413
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,660
Could it be the tablet? Right?

414
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,190
Which floor is the hospital room on?

415
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,980
8th floor. Internal Medicine department. #810.

416

<i>I have to take that there.</i>

419
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,940
<i>Take what?</i>

420
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,250
<i>That? Why?</i>

421
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,480
<i>There's someone I need to save.</i>

422
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,510
<i>Who?</i>

423
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,990
<i>So this is what you are saying now.</i>

424
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,730
<i>The woman who disappeared after Han Sang Hoon shot her,</i>

425
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,560
<i>is Oh Yeon Joo, your wife.</i>

426
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,380
<i>So that's why you killed Han Sang Hoon.</i>

427
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,280
<i>Your wife, who was brain-dead,</i>

428
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>stayed at your penthouse,</i>

429
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,370
<i>and died not long ago.</i>

430
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,360
<i>That's right.</i>

431
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,710
<i>She's dead.</i>

432
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,500
<i>But?</i>

433
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,870
<i>If I have that, I can save her.</i>

434
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,910
<i>You saw what that thing can do.</i>

435
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,770
<i>That's why I came to get it.</i>

436
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,590
<i>You can revive her again?</i>

437
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:51,320
<i>If you just press "Enter," a dead person will come back to be living again?</i>

438
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,710
<i>You have to draw it.</i>

439
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,600
<i>You have to draw it?</i>

440
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,600
<i>The owner of the tablet has to draw it.</i>

441
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,150
<i>That's why I was going to take it to the hospital.</i>

442
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,790
<i>The owner is in the hospital.</i>

443
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,550
<i>Crazy bastard! What kind of Manhwa-like fabrication are you saying?</i>

444
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,780
<i>You can resurrect a person by drawing?</i>

445
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,690
<i>What you saw is not Manhwa-like,</i>

446
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,270
<i>And then?</i>

447
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,830

448
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,230

461
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,060

462
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,120

463
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,550
<i>I am certain that he just died. And gunshot is correct, too.</i>

464
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,480
<i>I got it. Withdraw for now.</i>

465
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,360
<i>How should I accept this situation now?</i>

466
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,930
<i>You can confirm.</i>

467
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,900
<i>How?</i>

468
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,690
<i>If he draws and my wife resurrects, is there any clearer proof than that?</i>

469
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,620

00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,420
I am summoning Han Cheol Ho to the real world.

00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,430
Wait a minute.

504
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,820
But why do you look exactly like Han Sang Ho?

You...

506
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,520

How did you...?

508
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,360
What are you, bastard? What are you?

511
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,990
- Teacher!<br>- What are you?

512
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,400
Teacher... How could Han Cheol Ho bring it personally? He isn't a delivery person!

513
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,780
This is... a real table, right?

514
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:34,680
So there was a copy. But do you think it will function again, Teacher?

515
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,750
Teacher. Han Cheol Ho... Han Cheol Ho...

516
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,080
Han Cheol Ho went back.

Yeah.

00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,280
Yeah.

525
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,190
Gather in the hotel for now. There is something I need to explain to you guys.

00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,780
Miss Oh Yeon Joo?

528
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,820
Nurse. Nurse!

529
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,290
<i>To be continued</i>

530
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,210
How long has it been?

531
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,550
It's been about twenty minutes.

532
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,780
- Twenty minutes?<br>- Yes.

533
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,630
Oh, yes.

534
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,150
- Hello?<br>- <i>Soo Bong.</i>

535
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,400
Noona?

536
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,250
It's me. What happened?

537
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,630
N-Noona?! Noona, Noona Yeon Joo? Are you really Noona Yeon Joo?

538
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,020
But, this is imposs... Noona, is it really you?

539
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,770
Yeah, I'm alive. I guess I survived.

540
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:05,040
But, where are you? Where are you right now, Noona?

541
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,820
I...

542
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,660
I'm in the hotel right now. I just came back so suddenly.

543
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,750
Are you okay? You're fine? You can talk?

544
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,180
Oh, you're talking right now. Well, nothing's strange? You can move all your fingers and toes?

545
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,090
And you can remember everything? What about the place you got shot?

546
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,390
I'm not hurt.

547
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,330
I'm totally fine.

548
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,650
Ah, you really make people worry!

549
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,170
How did I survive?

550
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:33,440
Ah, really! Teacher! Teacher's drawings!

551
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,520
Dad came back?

552
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,360
Of course!

553
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,810
- But, he's not answering my calls.<br>- Huh?

554
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:45,550
Ah, he should be in the hotel right now. He kept waiting for the webtoon to appear.

555
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,020
<i>W</i>

556
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,590
If he saw the webtoon, he'll come to find you soon. I'm looking for Hyung Cheol right now.

557
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,800
Where?

558
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,390
Well, the place Hyung Cheol was tortured.

559
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,070
What do you mean tortured?

560
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,380
I came here to find him but he's not here right now.

561
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,580
<i>- Hey.<br>- Hey, hey, wait, wait.</i>

562
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,810
Aigoo.

563
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,170
<i>Hey, we should call the ambulance, right? Go tell the boss.</i>

564
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,430
<i>I got it.</i>

565
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,170
<i>What?</i>

566
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,540
<i>- Taxi...<br>- Huh?</i>

567
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,780
<i>Please call a taxi for me. I need to go to the hotel.</i>

568
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,740
<i>But, I think you should go to the hospital.</i>

569
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,400
<i>I mean...</i>

570
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,250
They said that they were worried so they called an ambulance, but he was gone by the time they arrived.

571
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,430
But, he would've went back to you, right?

572
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,900
Is he really hurt?

573
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,900
I understand. What about Dad? Is Dad okay?

574
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,320
A dead person was the worry! Why are yo--

575
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,880
Who is worrying about who right now?

576
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,810
I got it.

577
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,150
No, I'll look at the comic to see what happened.

578
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,820
That'll be faster.

579
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,490
Oh, okay.

580
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,370
I used the phone well.

581
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,230
Yes.

582
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:25,150
By any chance, can I use the internet for a moment?
