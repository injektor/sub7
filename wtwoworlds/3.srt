67

<font color="yellow">I suddenly found myself in the webtoon.</font>

70
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,730
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, a few things became clear.</font>

71
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,090
<font color="yellow">Everything in that world revolves around Chul.</font>

72
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,390
<font color="yellow">I don't appear on the cartoon unless I get involved with Chul.</font>

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,090
<font color="yellow">The time I do my own things and my thoughts...</font>

74
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,890
<font color="yellow">don't count. It all gets edited out.</font>

75
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,650
<font color="yellow">Chul is the main character and I'm just a supporting role.</font>

76
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,190
<font color="yellow">Also, time centres around Chul, too.</font>

77
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,750
<font color="yellow">It skips the time when Chul isn't doing anything.</font>

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,090
<font color="yellow">That's why two months passed in an instant.</font>

79
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,600
<font color="yellow">Less than five minutes in this world...</font>

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,460
<font color="yellow">can be as long as two months over there.</font>

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,260
<font color="yellow">It can even be 2 years or 20 years.</font>

82
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,230
<font color="yellow">How is it possible?</font>

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,230
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="yellow">This webtoon has been published serially for seven years.</font>

85
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,460
<font color="yellow">During those 7 years, 15 years have passed in Chul's life.</font>

86
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,790
<font color="yellow">It makes sense that time passes faster in it.</font>

87
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,660
<font color="yellow">It only shows important incidents.</font>

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,450
<font color="yellow">Also, whether I can come back or not depends on Chul.</font>

89
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,120
<font color="yellow">An ending scene must include a change in Chul's mind.</font>

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,390
<font color="yellow">That's how an episode ends.</font>

91
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,120
<font color="yellow">I can only come back when the episode ends. That's why...</font>

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,860
<font color="yellow">- I did it.
-  Did what?</font>

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
<font color="yellow">You mean the kiss?</font>

94
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,290
<font color="yellow">Did you really kiss Chul?</font>

95
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,260
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a choice. I had to surprise him or something.</font>

96
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,820
<font color="yellow">I needed an ending scene.</font>

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,390
<font color="yellow">No way. You did it on purpose.</font>

98
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,890
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows you're a fan of Chul.</font>

99

<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose!</font>

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
<font color="yellow">Was it good?</font>

101
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

102
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,090
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,890
<font color="yellow">he's a cartoon character. He's not real person.</font>

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,150
<font color="yellow">How was the touch of his lips?</font>

105
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,320

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,320

109
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
<font color="yellow">He's not different from us.</font>

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,790
<font color="yellow">I see. You were in a hurry.</font>

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,890

112

113
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,190

114
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,210

-  Goodness.</font>

117
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,860

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,090
<font color="yellow">He said he will start over today's episode. He'll probably kill Chul.</font>

128
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,460

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,820
<font color="yellow">I am sorry, but can you wait for me there? I'll be right there.</font>

308
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,920
<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay.</font>

309
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,760
<font color="yellow">My mouth always causes problem.</font>

310
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,530
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

311
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
<font color="yellow">You're here. This way, please.</font>

312
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear the details on the phone.</font>

313
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,120
<font color="yellow">What exactly happened?</font>

314
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,620
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang told me to make sure nobody speaks about it.</font>

315
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
<font color="yellow">Anyone who talks about it will get fired,</font>

316
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,990
<font color="yellow">so you don't have to worry about it.</font>

317
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,820
<font color="yellow">But we have no right to stop our customers.</font>

318
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,220
<font color="yellow">We got the contact number of the person who recorded the video.</font>

319
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,520
<font color="yellow">You should meet the customer and settle things yourself.</font>

320
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,720
<font color="yellow">What is the video about?</font>

321
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,590
<font color="yellow">It's...</font>

322
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,520
<font color="yellow">It seems like he had an argument...</font>

323
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,920
<font color="yellow">with a lady he came with.</font>

324
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,760
<font color="yellow">An argument?</font>

325
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,760
<font color="yellow">I don't know what exactly happened.</font>

326
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,590
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

327
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,960
<font color="yellow">That lady suddenly got upset and slapped his face.</font>

328
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,560
<font color="yellow">And they somehow became fine again...</font>

329
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
<font color="yellow">and started to kiss.</font>

330
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,260
<font color="yellow">Kiss?</font>

331
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,160
<font color="yellow">And they went inside the fitting room together.</font>

332
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,090
<font color="yellow">They locked the door, too.</font>

333
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,660
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang came out alone after a long time.</font>

334
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,320
<font color="yellow">But that's not what he wanted to hide.</font>

335
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,690
<font color="yellow">He wanted to hide the fact that she disappeared.</font>

336
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,310
<font color="yellow">She disappeared?</font>

337
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,590
<font color="yellow">Yes. They went in together,</font>

338
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,460
<font color="yellow">but only Mr Kang came out. She disappeared.</font>

339
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,960
<font color="yellow">I don't understand what you're talking right now.</font>

340
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,570
<font color="yellow">I don't understand it, either.</font>

341
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,720
<font color="yellow">But everyone says the same thing.</font>

342
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,820
<font color="yellow">Where is the fitting room?</font>

343
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,290
<font color="yellow">It's over there.</font>

344
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,520
<font color="yellow">No, it was the other door.</font>

345
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,760
<font color="yellow">There's nowhere to leave. How did she manage to disappear?</font>

346
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,020
<font color="yellow">- Well...
-  Excuse me?</font>

347
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,520
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

348
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,990
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

349
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,920
<font color="yellow">I'm at the store right now.</font>

350
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,360
<font color="yellow">Did you meet the manager?</font>

351
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,460
<font color="yellow">Yeon Joo is here.</font>

352
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,720
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  She's here.</font>

353
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,920
<font color="yellow">Inside the fitting room.</font>

354
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

355
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,020
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to ask. What happened?</font>

356
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,490
<font color="yellow">She was in there. Why did you say she disappeared?</font>

357
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,790
<font color="yellow">Yeon Joo.</font>

358
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,160
<font color="yellow">She won't wake up.</font>

359
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,760
<font color="yellow">Is it the rescue centre?</font>

360
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160
<font color="yellow">- We have a patient here.
-  Don't call an ambulance.</font>

361
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,360
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Hang up the phone.</font>

362
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,620
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to do?</font>

363
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,250
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

364
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,090
<font color="yellow">She can't go to a hospital. I'm taking her to a hotel.</font>

365
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,160
<font color="yellow">How will you take the responsibility?</font>

366
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,900
<font color="yellow">Please send over Doctor Yoon.</font>

367
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,490
<font color="yellow">I'll go there first. Wrap up and come to the hotel.</font>

368
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

369
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,790
<font color="yellow">Why am I here again?</font>

370
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,860
<font color="yellow">I'm curious, too. Why did you come back?</font>

371
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,060
<font color="yellow">I don't know, either.</font>

372
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,690
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

373
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

374
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,890
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

375
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,190
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

376
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,220
<font color="yellow">- Where's Doctor Yoon?
-  He's not here yet.</font>

377
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
<font color="yellow">Mr Kang!</font>

378
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,760
<font color="yellow">Detective Park is here.</font>

379
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,460
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

380
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,430
<font color="yellow">Hello. What brings you here?</font>

381
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,460
<font color="yellow">I came because of the witness, Oh Yeon Joo.</font>

382
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,670
<font color="yellow">I see. You haven't found her yet?</font>

383
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,460
<font color="yellow">She's really strange.</font>

384
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,790
<font color="yellow">How did she manage to avoid all the surveillance cameras?</font>

385
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,020
<font color="yellow">You don't have to try too hard.</font>

386
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,550
<font color="yellow">She's not a criminal. It's okay if you can't find her.</font>

387
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,520
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? We are going to find her.</font>

388
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

389
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,060
<font color="yellow">Something happened.</font>

390
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,660
<font color="yellow">I will go put her in bed.</font>

391
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,820
<font color="yellow">You don't have to see us out.</font>

392
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,790
<font color="yellow">We will get going then.</font>

393
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,490
<font color="yellow">What? Isn't she Yeon Joo?</font>

394
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,890
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

395
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,120
<font color="yellow">Finally, she's in my arms.</font>

396
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

397
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,220
<font color="yellow">She's the key to my life.</font>

398
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,120
<font color="yellow">By the way, is she really pretty?</font>

399
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,560
<font color="yellow">Is she pretty?</font>

400
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

401
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,490
<font color="yellow">Why does everyone say that she's beautiful?</font>

402
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
<font color="yellow">You're awake.</font>

403
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>

404
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,220
<font color="yellow">I feel dizzy.</font>

405
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,090
<font color="yellow">You're probably still drunk from the medicine.</font>

406
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,890
<font color="yellow">You're not dying, so don't worry.</font>

407
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,790
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

408
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,920
<font color="yellow">It's my room. It's where I stay.</font>

409
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,560
<font color="yellow">The penthouse?</font>

410
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,590
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

411
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,760
<font color="yellow">You live at the hotel penthouse. It's on the 33th, the top floor.</font>

412
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,190
<font color="yellow">You really know everything about me.</font>

413
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,360
<font color="yellow">I know everything.</font>

414
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,860
<font color="yellow">What else do you know?</font>

415
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,790
<font color="yellow">I know that your family...</font>

416
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,560
<font color="yellow">suddenly got killed in your house and it traumatised you.</font>

417
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,060
<font color="yellow">That's why you live in hotels without having your own house.</font>

418
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,990
<font color="yellow">That's interesting.</font>

419
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,090
<font color="yellow">What else do you know?</font>

420
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,190
<font color="yellow">You keep a gun underneath your pillow.</font>

421
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,360
<font color="yellow">You always keep it there even though it's illegal.</font>

422
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,190
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep without it.</font>

423
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,420
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

424
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,120
<font color="yellow">I saw it.</font>

425
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,260
<font color="yellow">Where did you see it?</font>

426
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
<font color="yellow">That was the saddest scene.</font>

427
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,660
<font color="yellow">The Han River Bridge.</font>

428
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,560
<font color="yellow">I cried as well at the time.</font>

429
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,620
<font color="yellow">I was afraid...</font>

430
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,090
<font color="yellow">Chul would really kill himself.</font>

431
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
<font color="yellow">Die!</font>

432
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,120
<font color="yellow">Die! Die!</font>

433
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
<font color="yellow">Die!</font>

434
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,730
<font color="yellow">You were supposed to guard the door.</font>

435
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,570
<font color="yellow">- We were told to come downstairs.
-  By whom?</font>

436
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,830
<font color="yellow">The message was from Do Yoon's phone,</font>

437
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,800
<font color="yellow">but he said he didn't send it.</font>

438
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,630
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

439
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
<font color="yellow">find you soon.</font>

440
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
<font color="yellow">Wait for it.</font>

441
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,830
<font color="yellow">Where am I?</font>

442
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,830
<font color="yellow">Is this Chul's room?</font>

443
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,030
<font color="yellow">It is his room. This is his bed and that is... Oh my gosh.</font>

444
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,730
<font color="yellow">Did I get dragged in here again? Why?</font>

445
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,960
<font color="yellow">Why? How?</font>

446
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

447
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,800
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  How are you feeling?</font>

448
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,850
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

449
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,560
<font color="yellow">A nurse checked on you. She said you're all fine.</font>

450
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,700
<font color="yellow">- You'll be just fine.
-  Why did she say I fainted?</font>

451
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,860
<font color="yellow">- She said it's from overwork.
-  Overwork?</font>

452
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,100
<font color="yellow">A severe exhaustion put a lot of strain on your body.</font>

453
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,940
<font color="yellow">A severe exhaustion?</font>

454
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,560
<font color="yellow">You were in bed for two days.</font>

455
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,360
<font color="yellow">Maybe you overstrained yourself.</font>

456
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,300
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

457
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,930
<font color="yellow">Well... Maybe I did.</font>

458
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,200
<font color="yellow">Why don't you eat lunch with President Kang? He'll be back soon.</font>

459
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,830
<font color="yellow">- Will he come back here?
-  Yes.</font>

460
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,770
<font color="yellow">I prepared some clothes you can change into in the bathroom.</font>

461
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
<font color="yellow">- I see.
-  Excuse me.</font>

462
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,400
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

463
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,600
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do now? My goodness.</font>

464
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,830
<font color="yellow">It's huge.</font>

465
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,200
<font color="yellow">It's see-through.</font>

466
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,230
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

467
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,860
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the biggest problem?</font>

468
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,230
<font color="yellow">How do you know what would happen if you get involved with Chul?</font>

469
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,630
<font color="yellow">What if you are dragged into the webtoon suddenly?</font>

470
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,560
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Wait a minute.</font>

471
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

472
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,400
<font color="yellow">- Did you say she's alone?
-  She's in the shower.</font>

473
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,230
<font color="yellow">I told you not to leave her alone when she wakes up.</font>

474
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,060
<font color="yellow">- I can't go in there with her.
-  My gosh.</font>

475
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

476
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,660
<font color="yellow">Which one should I pick?</font>

477
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,400
<font color="yellow">She can't run away from here. This is on the 33rd floor.</font>

478
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,660
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

479
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,330
<font color="yellow">I heard she's awake.</font>

480
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,800
<font color="yellow">- Yes. You can see her later.
-  Why? What is she doing now?</font>

481
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,530
<font color="yellow">She's having an honest talk with Chul.</font>

482
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,860
<font color="yellow">In the bathroom?</font>

483
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,500
<font color="yellow">Here you go again, Yeon Joo.</font>

484
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,930
<font color="yellow">What is this now?</font>

485
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,300
<font color="yellow">It's 11am and you just woke up. What are you trying to do here?</font>

486
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,430
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

487
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,000
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
-  It's nothing.</font>

488
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,960
<font color="yellow">You always do things and say it's nothing.</font>

489
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me.</font>

490
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,400
<font color="yellow">Stop. I'll shoot you if you don't.</font>

491
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're such an unpredictable woman.</font>

492
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,700
<font color="yellow">You suddenly showed up,</font>

493
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,730
<font color="yellow">slapped me in the face, kissed me,</font>

494
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,730
<font color="yellow">disappeared and showed up again.</font>

495
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,030
<font color="yellow">Now, you suddenly take your clothes off...</font>

496
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,560
<font color="yellow">and point a gun at me.</font>

497
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,000
<font color="yellow">I know you don't understand me. I'd do the same if I were you.</font>

498
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,130
<font color="yellow">There is a reason why I'm doing this.</font>

499
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,830
<font color="yellow">- What reason?
-  Don't move.</font>

500
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,330
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to shoot you. I'm not kidding.</font>

501
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,600
<font color="yellow">- Go ahead then.
-  I'm serious.</font>

502
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,860
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous!</font>

503
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,800
<font color="yellow">Why do you worry when you're going to kill me?</font>

504
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,770
<font color="yellow">I said I will shoot you!</font>

505
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,160
<font color="yellow">You have to have bullets. Don't you know that?</font>

506
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,130
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see...</font>

507
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,400
<font color="yellow">what you'd do when you know that I keep a gun under my pillow.</font>

508
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

509
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,360
<font color="yellow">I don't like doing this, so let's compromise by talking.</font>

510
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,180
<font color="yellow">I have about 100 questions,</font>

511
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,560
<font color="yellow">but I'll let you live if you answer the first question.</font>

512
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,270
<font color="yellow">How did you disappear that day?</font>

513
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,160
<font color="yellow">I have to report you to the police if you don't answer.</font>

514
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,950
<font color="yellow">How cruel!</font>

515
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,760
<font color="yellow">You said that I saved your life.</font>

516
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,630
<font color="yellow">Certainly, you did. That's why I let you go before.</font>

517
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,860
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the one who broke the promise?</font>

518
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,560
<font color="yellow">You disappeared without answering any of my questions.</font>

519
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,700
<font color="yellow">You must keep the promise now.</font>

520
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,460
<font color="yellow">I waited for two months like a gentleman.</font>

521
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,930
<font color="yellow">Do you agree?</font>

522
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,160
<font color="yellow">How did you disappear?</font>

523
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,830
<font color="yellow">There must have been a way.</font>

524
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,530
<font color="yellow">I'll have to report you to the police if you don't answer.</font>

525
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,960
<font color="yellow">If you can't answer it, here's my next question.</font>

526
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you kiss me after hitting me that day?</font>

527
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,600
<font color="yellow">I'll wait since we still have a lot of time.</font>

528
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,030
<font color="yellow">I did that so I could disappear.</font>

529
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

530
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,270
<font color="yellow">I did that so I could disappear.</font>

531
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,300
<font color="yellow">Do what?</font>

532
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
<font color="yellow">I kissed you.</font>

533
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,270
<font color="yellow">Kiss.</font>

534
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,660
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

535
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,060
<font color="yellow">You kissed me so you could disappear.</font>

536
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,770
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

537
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,060
<font color="yellow">I didn't imagine such an answer.</font>

538
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,330
<font color="yellow">Did you disappear because you kissed me that day?</font>

539
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,500
<font color="yellow">Is it the way?</font>

540
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,800
<font color="yellow">It's true,</font>

541
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,860
<font color="yellow">so please stop it and let me go.</font>

542
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,530
<font color="yellow">- Is that so?
-  Yes.</font>

543
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:21,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you still here?</font>

544
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,960
<font color="yellow">You're still here.</font>

545
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,960
<font color="yellow">Just kissing won't make me disappear.</font>

546
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,930
<font color="yellow">There has to be a change in emotions.</font>

547
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,460
<font color="yellow">I was talking about that kind of kiss.</font>

548
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,330
<font color="yellow">Emotions?</font>

549
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't like it very much then.</font>

550
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,400
<font color="yellow">You may not have liked it, but you were surprised.</font>

551
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,460
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was.</font>

552
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,530
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean. There was some kind of change in your emotions.</font>

553
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,700
<font color="yellow">That's the rule.</font>

554
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,130
<font color="yellow">You seem surprised. You're blushing.</font>

555
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,860
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about you.</font>

556
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,300
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
-  Your change of emotions counts.</font>

557
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,840
<font color="yellow">What kind of rule is that?</font>

558
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,360
<font color="yellow">Why are my emotions important?</font>

559
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,830
<font color="yellow">It's because you're the main character.</font>

560
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
<font color="yellow">The main character?</font>

561
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,860
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

562
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,200
<font color="yellow">What you just did can be considered sexual assault.</font>

563
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,230
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue you.</font>

564
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,860
<font color="yellow">You're the one who committed sexual assault.</font>

565
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,260
<font color="yellow">On top of that, you slapped me.</font>

566
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,650
<font color="yellow">Besides, I was doing a scientific experiment...</font>

567
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,730
<font color="yellow">to prove the logic of your statement.</font>

568
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,570
<font color="yellow">What you're saying now...</font>

569
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,330
<font color="yellow">is that you can only disappear when there's a change of...</font>

570
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,230
<font color="yellow">emotions in me.</font>

571
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
<font color="yellow">Is that correct?</font>

572
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,000
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Is that why you slapped me?</font>

573
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,260
<font color="yellow">Did you fire the gun and took off that gown to surprise me?</font>

574
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,930
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

575
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,330
<font color="yellow">It's very peculiar.</font>

576
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,330
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd say it was teleporting.</font>

577
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,360
<font color="yellow">Still, it doesn't seem like a lie...</font>

578
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,860
<font color="yellow">since you're still here even when you had a chance to disappear.</font>

579
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

580
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,860
<font color="yellow">Just because it's not a lie doesn't mean it's true.</font>

581
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,630
<font color="yellow">You're only talking about what happened...</font>

582
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,100
<font color="yellow">without the important context.</font>

583
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,860
<font color="yellow">There must be something you're hiding.</font>

584
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,500
<font color="yellow">There must be a context which explains why you can disappear...</font>

585
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,730
<font color="yellow">only when there's been a change of emotions in me.</font>

586
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,300
<font color="yellow">You must tell me.</font>

587
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,300
<font color="yellow">I don't know any more than that.</font>

588
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
<font color="yellow">How could you not know?</font>

589
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,330
<font color="yellow">Answer in the count of 10.</font>

590
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,200
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

591
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,100
<font color="yellow">- Two.
-  I said I don't know.</font>

592
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,160
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

593
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,430
<font color="yellow">- Four.
-  Don't scare me.</font>

594
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,740
<font color="yellow">You won't even fire.</font>

595
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,760
<font color="yellow">Five.</font>

596
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,300
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

597
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,500
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

598
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,230
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

599
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,630
<font color="yellow">I'm investigating instead of the police...</font>

600
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,230
<font color="yellow">because you talk too much.</font>

601
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,270
<font color="yellow">However, Yeon Joo keeps teasing me...</font>

602
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,500
<font color="yellow">instead of telling the truth.</font>

603
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

604
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,990
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
-  Get out.</font>

605
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,100
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. She's still a patient.
-  Get out!</font>

606
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,400
<font color="yellow">This is how you fire a gun.</font>

607
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,700
<font color="yellow">This is very important with my life on the line.</font>

608
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,860
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter even though you saved my life.</font>

609
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,700
<font color="yellow">You were a saviour, but you're also very dangerous.</font>

610
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,830
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm going to shoot if you don't answer.</font>

611
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,430
<font color="yellow">I counted up to five.</font>

612
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:43,930
<font color="yellow">Six.</font>

613
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,130
<font color="yellow">Seven.</font>

614
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,300
<font color="yellow">How important is the secret that you can't tell even at gunpoint?</font>

615
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,630
<font color="yellow">You won't shoot me.</font>

616
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,100
<font color="yellow">Eight.</font>

617
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,300
<font color="yellow">How can you be sure?</font>

618
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:04,860
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

619
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,000
<font color="yellow">wouldn't do that.</font>

620
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
<font color="yellow">Nine.</font>

621
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,100
<font color="yellow">I thought you knew everything about me,</font>

622
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,960
<font color="yellow">but you're wrong about certain things.</font>

623
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,460
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

624
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,100
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

625
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,160
<font color="yellow">Will you not answer me?</font>

626
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,030
<font color="yellow">Ten.</font>

627
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,130
<font color="yellow">(W)</font>

628
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
<font color="yellow">Were you surprised?</font>

629
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,930
<font color="yellow">You didn't know the power you had.</font>

630
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,330
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

631
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
<font color="yellow">Did you shoot her?</font>

632
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,860
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

633
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,800
<font color="yellow">She passed out because she was shocked. Move her to a room.</font>

634
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,630
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind? What have you done?</font>

635
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,800
<font color="yellow">I was only trying to scare her.</font>

636
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,030
<font color="yellow">You've completely lost your mind.</font>

637
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,430
<font color="yellow">Please come now.</font>

638
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,430
<font color="yellow">The patient became unconscious again.</font>

639
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,530
<font color="yellow">Something...</font>

640
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,830
<font color="yellow">shocking happened.</font>

641
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, please come now.</font>

642
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,130
<font color="yellow">- Could you bring us some water?
-  Okay.</font>

643
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,730
<font color="yellow">Did he lose his mind after being in the hospital for too long?</font>

644
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,730
<font color="yellow">He's odd, but she's very odd, too.</font>

645
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,560
<font color="yellow">They're both odd.</font>

646
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,590
<font color="yellow">Did you call the nurse?</font>

647
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,460
<font color="yellow">I said to hand her over to the police.</font>

648
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,800
<font color="yellow">Did you bring her to act like a hoodlum? Are you a gang or what?</font>

649
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,160
<font color="yellow">Why would you threaten a woman with a gun?</font>

650
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,400
<font color="yellow">Isn't an investigation for truth what you wanted?</font>

651
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,130
<font color="yellow">Report her to the police now.</font>

652
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,560
<font color="yellow">Not to the police.</font>

653
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,920
<font color="yellow">I can't bear to watch it.</font>

654
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,960
<font color="yellow">Report her to the police first. If they can't solve it,</font>

655
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,600
<font color="yellow">we can investigate then. That's the order of things.</font>

656
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,200
<font color="yellow">Why do you make things complicated?</font>

657
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,460
<font color="yellow">You don't know what you're getting yourself into.</font>

658
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,960
<font color="yellow">I told you not to.</font>

659
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,460
<font color="yellow">It will never be solved once the police get involved.</font>

660
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,900
<font color="yellow">I told you. Yeon Joo is the key to my life.</font>

661
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,000
<font color="yellow">Please change my flight to night schedule. I'm dropping by Busan.</font>

662
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,430
<font color="yellow">Is she awake?</font>

663
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,940
<font color="yellow">How is she?</font>

664
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,430
<font color="yellow">I gave her a tranquilliser, and her blood pressure is normal.</font>

665
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,630
<font color="yellow">- Please give us some minutes.
-  Sure.</font>

666
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,060
<font color="yellow">Are you upset?</font>

667
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,900
<font color="yellow">Did you ask if I'm upset?</font>

668
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,560
<font color="yellow">That's not the right expression.</font>

669
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,960
<font color="yellow">You shot me with the gun.</font>

670
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for surprising you.</font>

671
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,500
<font color="yellow">Actually, I knew that a gunshot wouldn't kill you.</font>

672
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,660
<font color="yellow">Why don't you know that?</font>

673
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,100
<font color="yellow">You're invincible, Yeon Joo.</font>

674
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,500
<font color="yellow">You can never die.</font>

675
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,860
<font color="yellow">You really didn't know that?</font>

676
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,800
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

677
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,830
<font color="yellow">If you answer my question, I'll tell you.</font>

678
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,330
<font color="yellow">Since we had already seen it,</font>

679
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,960
<font color="yellow">let's admit that you are not an ordinary person.</font>

680
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,630
<font color="yellow">You're perhaps from another world.</font>

681
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,430
<font color="yellow">From another world that I don't know about.</font>

682
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,730
<font color="yellow">You work as a cardiothoracic surgery resident there.</font>

683
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

684
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,100
<font color="yellow">(Cardiothoracic surgery resident, Oh Yeon Joo)</font>

685
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,930
<font color="yellow">Where is that?</font>

686
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,300
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm relieved.</font>

687
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,170
<font color="yellow">I checked with my eyes that you can't disappear like last time.</font>

688
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,730
<font color="yellow">If everything is up to me,</font>

689
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,900
<font color="yellow">that means there is no way you can escape.</font>

690
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,730
<font color="yellow">You know me well, don't you?</font>

691
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,430
<font color="yellow">Once I make my mind, I never get swayed.</font>

692
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,530
<font color="yellow">That's my talent.</font>

693
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,060
<font color="yellow">I even won a gold medal with that, too.</font>

694
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,630
<font color="yellow">So now, you can't go back...</font>

695
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,400
<font color="yellow">until you answer all my questions.</font>

696
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,360
<font color="yellow">Stay here with me.</font>

697
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,920
<font color="yellow">Since you saved my life,</font>

698
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,730
<font color="yellow">I will protect you from the police and the media.</font>

699
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,730
<font color="yellow">You can stay here as long as you like.</font>

700
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,460
<font color="yellow">If you want to go back, you just have to answer my questions.</font>

701
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,200
<font color="yellow">It seems like you have a lot of surprising things to tell me.</font>

702
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,530
<font color="yellow">If you say the truth and surprise me, you get to go back.</font>

703
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,060
<font color="yellow">I'll be able to find the answers I want then.</font>

704
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,960
<font color="yellow">What do you think? It's a fair deal, isn't it?</font>

705
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:50,060
<font color="yellow">Surprise me if you want to go back.</font>

706
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,560
<font color="yellow">What kind of world is the world you live in?</font>

707
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,200
<font color="yellow">You said you know and saw everything about me.</font>

708
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,060
<font color="yellow">Where did you see me?</font>

709
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
<font color="yellow">Is it hard to answer?</font>

710
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,460
<font color="yellow">It's hard.</font>

711
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,720
<font color="yellow">Then let's stay here together. I don't mind.</font>

712
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,800
<font color="yellow">We have plenty of time.</font>

713
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,960
<font color="yellow">You want me...</font>

714
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,030
<font color="yellow">- to live here?
-  If not here,</font>

715
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,660
<font color="yellow">where would you go?</font>

716
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,100
<font color="yellow">I think you have nowhere to go.</font>

717
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,130
<font color="yellow">We're ready.</font>

718
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,960
<font color="yellow">I planned to have lunch together before going on a business trip.</font>

719
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,030
<font color="yellow">But something came up in Busan. Let's eat when I'm back.</font>

720
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,230
<font color="yellow">I'll be back on Friday. My secretary will assist you in the meantime.</font>

721
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,230
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

722
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,030
<font color="yellow">It's the mobile phone you threw last time. Call me if anything happens.</font>

723
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,500
<font color="yellow">I want to reconcile with you. I'm sorry for what I did a while ago.</font>

724
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,000
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologise.</font>

725
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,560
<font color="yellow">Rest well.</font>

726
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

727
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

728
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,100
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

729
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,060
<font color="yellow">You must've thought I'd be really surprised to see you in nude.</font>

730
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,500
<font color="yellow">You thought my heart would beat fast and my eyes would go blind?</font>

731
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,900
<font color="yellow">No. I just took a chance.</font>

732
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,530
<font color="yellow">- Do you know you're unbelievable?
-  I know that.</font>

733
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,460
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

734
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,530
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

735
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,160
<font color="yellow">- What is it really?
-  What?</font>

736
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,150
<font color="yellow">You said she's not beautiful at all,</font>

737
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,400
<font color="yellow">but you act like you're in love.</font>

738
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,510
<font color="yellow">She'd been naked.</font>

739
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,400
<font color="yellow">She kissed you and confessed her love. She even slapped you.</font>

740
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,500
<font color="yellow">All that looks like a love fight.</font>

741
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,780
<font color="yellow">And what? Are you going to stay here together?</font>

742
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,830
<font color="yellow">That's like a couple moving in together.</font>

743
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,500
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
-  Anyone would think that.</font>

744
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,910
<font color="yellow">- Right.
-  You're so cool about it.</font>

745
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,360
<font color="yellow">It's complicated. Think however you want.</font>

746
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,530
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

747
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,930
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

748
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,860
<font color="yellow">You said you are going somewhere.</font>

749
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,330
<font color="yellow">I'm stopping by Busan and going to New York. Why?</font>

750
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,000
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

751
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,830
<font color="yellow">Am I going to die on the way?</font>

752
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,200
<font color="yellow">Will the train derail? Or will the aeroplane get hijacked?</font>

753
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,930
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I was just worried.</font>

754
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,660
<font color="yellow">You are not sure how I'm going to die this time.</font>

755
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,130
<font color="yellow">When I'm here, I don't know things, either.</font>

756
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,260
<font color="yellow">So I can't help you.</font>

757
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,860
<font color="yellow">You can know from there then?</font>

758
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

759
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,800
<font color="yellow">I'm even more curious about you now.</font>

760
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,300
<font color="yellow">You never answer. Why are you worried that I might die?</font>

761
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,730
<font color="yellow">I am one of those people...</font>

762
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,300
<font color="yellow">who want your life to be a happy ending.</font>

763
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,230
<font color="yellow">I am your fan. Really.</font>

764
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,200
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I'm going to be unfortunate if I hear the answer?</font>

765
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,730
<font color="yellow">Perhaps.</font>

766
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,730
<font color="yellow">That's why I can't answer.</font>

767
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,830
<font color="yellow">Besides, you are my first patient...</font>

768
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,000
<font color="yellow">I saved alone.</font>

769
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,930
<font color="yellow">Is that right? I'm honoured.</font>

770
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,360
<font color="yellow">- You are my second patient, too.
-  I'm even more honoured.</font>

771
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,360
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

772
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,430
<font color="yellow">always be careful.</font>

773
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,330
<font color="yellow">I will do that.</font>

774
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,200
<font color="yellow">I guess you will answer this question.</font>

775
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,900
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

776
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,460
<font color="yellow">I'm 30.</font>

777
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,330
<font color="yellow">We're the same age. Are you married?</font>

778
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,900
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

779
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,160
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

780
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,200
<font color="yellow">I found out why I kept dragged here...</font>

781
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,160
<font color="yellow">only after a while.</font>

782
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,000
<font color="yellow">It was because this man...</font>

783
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,230
<font color="yellow">had said that I was the key to his life.</font>

784
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:52,930
<font color="yellow">At that moment,</font>

785
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,560
<font color="yellow">the heroine of this webtoon changed.</font>

786
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,260
<font color="yellow">From Yoon So Hee...</font>

787
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
<font color="yellow">to Oh Yeon Joo.</font>

788
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,790
<font color="yellow">(W)</font>

789
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,980
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Yeon Joo is the key to my life.</font>

790
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,200
<font color="yellow">She's the only one who can open the door to the secrets.</font>

791
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,900
<font color="yellow">Would you like to go and drink a glass of wine with me?</font>

792
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,060
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

793
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,490
<font color="yellow">You are the doctor from the rooftop.</font>

794
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,800
<font color="yellow">What do I do? I can't get caught by the police.</font>

795
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,910
<font color="yellow">Please reveal your identity.</font>

796
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,900
<font color="yellow">Even if I want to, I have no identity to reveal.</font>

797
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,420
<font color="yellow">If she's an innocent citizen, why can't she identify herself?</font>

798
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,020
<font color="yellow">They're convinced that you are the criminal.</font>

799
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,720
<font color="yellow">You need to answer my question now.</font>

800
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,600
<font color="yellow">- You're going to regret this.
-  I won't.</font>

801
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,830
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by the world I live in?</font>

802
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,530
<font color="yellow">The world inside a webtoon.</font>
